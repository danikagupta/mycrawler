Contamination of soils, groundwater, sediments, surface water and air with hazardous and toxic chemicals is one of the major problems facing the industrialised world today. Of the various types of industry-generated effluents, those containing organic pollutants 
such as phenols are generally difficult to remediate. There is a need to develop new 
technologies that emphasize the destruction of these pollutants rather than their disposal. The bioremediation of phenolic effluents by white rot fungi, and the oxidative 
enzymes produced by them, has been the topic of much research and is widely reported on in literature. This study focuses on the integration of an optimised process of enzyme 
production/ phenol degradation by the fungi Trametes versicolor  and Trametes 
pubescens  (Figure (i)) with an Airlift Loop Reactor  found suitable for the large-scale 
fermentation of these organisms.  
 
The broad aim of this project was to devel op a reactor-based bioprocess utilising the 
white rot fungus Trametes versicolor  for the remediation of phenol-contaminated 
wastewaters. To this end it was necessary to first investigate the physiology of the 
organism in terms of laccase production and its response to the presence of phenols in 
its environment.  T. versicolor  had been reported as an excellent producer of laccase but 
the successful application of this organism in a bioremediation process required the 
production of high amounts of this enzyme. The degree of success achieved in the 
laboratory in the mineralisation/ removal from solution of many major pollutants had so far only been realised in flask culture or in rather laboratory-specific reactor applications. 
A more practical (in terms of future scale-up) , cost effective reactor system that provided 
a well-oxygenated, yet low shear environment was required.  
 
Figure (i) White rot fungal growth in vivo and in vitro  
 iiUsing a comparison of the growth media recommended in literature as a basis for further 
experimentation, a ‘nutrient sufficient’ medium directed towards rapid biomass 
accumulation and increased lignolytic enzyme (laccase) production was developed. 
Enzyme activity was further increased by screening a variety of known inducers and comparing them with additions of small co ncentrations of stripped gas liquor from a 
Fischer-Tropsch plant, the target effluent in this study. In this way laccase production 
was increased by 700 %. The removal from solution of the principal effluent monomers (phenol, p-, m-  and o- cresol) was studied, with up to 20 % v/v effluent being removed in 
flask culture. An investigation was conducted to elucidate the effect of this effluent on the 
morphology and physiology on the two Trametes  species, with particular emphasis on 
laccase production. 
 Large scale, cost-effective applications of white-rot fungi to continuous treatment of 
liquid effluent has previously been hindered by the lack of suitable bioreactor systems. A 
hollow fibre membrane bioreactor and a trickl e filter were investigated for suitability as 
supports for immobilised biofilms of T. versicolor  and laccase production and pollutant 
degradation were successfully demonstrated in both reactor configurations. However, 
the need for a simple, cost effective, yet simple to upscale reactor system led to the 
investigation and development of an airlift loop reactor (ALR). These reactors have well 
defined flow patterns, high liquid velocities and yet provide a relatively low shear 
environment ideal for the growth of T. pubescens . The reactor configuration and aeration 
rate were optimised using recognised chemical engineering principles. Favourable 
feeding strategies, the effects of inducers/precursors and the timing of effluent addition were investigated. Increased growth (10g/L dry mass) and enzyme production 
(12000U/L) as well as highly efficient effluent degradation (5% v/v/day) were achieved in the ALR in fermentations over two week periods.

In the ALR system, a total pollutant removal of 0.1 g/g biomass/day was achieved in a 
3.5L reactor, as compared with 0.5 g/g biomass/day achieved in single dose flask 
reactions. To our knowledge the concentrations of the phenolic monomers removed by 
T. versicolor in this system are the highest reported to date.   This study demonstrated 
that in the ALR/ T pubescens  system, the simplicity of design, low cost of operation and 
high performance that are essential for a su ccessful biological wastewater treatment 
scheme, can be achieved.

 vOBJECTIVES 
Overall project aim:   
Development of a practicable bioremediat ion process for using the enzymes of  
Trametes versicolor  to degrade pollutants in specific industrial wastes, namely 
chlorinated aromatics and phenolics produced by the pulp-and-paper and petrochemical 
industry.   
Key objectives: 
1. Characterisation of the biological conversion by Trametes versicolor,  of the 
phenolics, chlorinated phenolics and polyaromatics present in these effluents.  
This would include characterisation of the roles and activity levels of the enzyme 
activities involved, and the fate of the organic compounds converted.  
2. An optimised fermentation or fed-batch process in which the Trametes versicolor 
successfully degrades these pollutants.    
3. A laboratory scale bioreactor involving a pneumatic fermenter linked to a 
membrane module, with Trametes versicolor  growing and producing enzymes 
continuously at steady state with continuous operation of this system for a 
prolonged time to demonstrate its feasibility.  
4. Development of models of the biological reactions in terms of cell growth, enzyme 
production, biodegradation rates and the operation of the fermenter / membrane module bioreactor for bioremediation 
5. Establishment and demonstration of the process in a demonstration plant by scale-
up of the laboratory scale bioreactor system, on the basis of models. (However, it was decided at the first Steering Committee meeting of the project that scale-up 
was outside the scope of the project.) 
6. Transfer of technology to relevant ind ustries and reporting on these results. 
  viKEY PROJECT FINDINGS 
 
1. The basidiomycetes Trametes versicolor  (PPRI 3845) and Trametes pubescens  
(CBS 696.94) were shown to be outstanding producers of the oxidative enzyme 
laccase and are consequently resilient to the effects of aromatic compounds 
usually toxic to most other microorganisms. 
2. The production of this enzyme was optimised in static culture by the use of a 
carbon and nitrogen ‘sufficient’ growth medium; and further increased by the 
addition of various inducer compounds, including a ‘stripped gas liquor’ effluent.  
3. The complex physiological response of T. versicolor to the addition of the phenolic 
effluent was illustrated and explained in terms of enz yme production, metabolic 
activity and morphological differentiation. Many of the deleterious effects of effluent addition can be ameliorated by controlling the amounts added, and the time of 
these additions relative to culture age. 
· The pollutant compounds induce the enzymes required for their catabolism 
· increasing their concentrations resulted in increased fungal biomass 
· addition of a readily utilisable carbon source (glucose) was shown to increase 
and prolong oxidative enzyme production, and hence the removal of the 
aromatic toxins from solution

4. Immobilised biofilm reactors in the form of a Transverse Flow Membrane 
Bioreactor and a Trickle Bed Reactor were identified as suitable for growth, 
enzyme production and phenolic removal by T. versicolor .  vii5. Control of aeration rate was shown to optimise the fermentation performance for 
growth of Trametes  species in an Airlift Loop Reactor and this system was found to 
outperform the other reactors investigated in terms of laccase production and the 
bioremediation of phenolic compounds. 
· ALRs are well suited to wastewater treatment and have been shown in this 
study to be additionally suited to the growth of Trametes pubescens.  Control of 
aeration rate was shown to optimise the fermentation performance for growth of Trametes species in the Airlift Loop Reactor and this system was found to outperform the other reactors investigated in terms of laccase production and 
the bioremediation of phenolic compounds. 
6. In the ALR system, a total pollutant removal of 0.1 g/g biomass/day was achieved 
in a 3.5L reactor, and 14 g was removed over 16 days. To our knowledge the concentrations of the phenolic monomers removed by Trametes in this system are 
the highest reported to date.

  viii7. The combination of the reactor configuration developed here and the efficiency of 
T. pubescens  in the degradation of the phenolic compounds form the basis of an 
important, novel bioremediation process. 
8. The development of this Trametes  based treatment technology represents a 
departure from the traditional mixed cu lture biological processes commonly used to 
decrease the toxicity of industrial w astewater: here, a monoculture was used 
consistently reduce a range of compounds to low levels or, in most cases, 
completely remove them from solution 
Complete removal of phenols in ALR was achieved over extended operation times. 
Repeated additions successfully removed and minimal polymer accumulation was observed.   ixRECOMMENDATIONS 
 
· Since the objectives of the project were very successfully achieved, it would be 
valuable and meaningful to take the system to larger scale and demonstrate its 
effectiveness at pilot scale.  This was beyond the scope of this project, 
however, and although much effort was put into attracting support from the relevant large-scale industrial company, their support was not forthcoming.  It is 
strongly recommended by the research team that this piloting should be considered.  
· There has been considerable international interest in collaboration on 
developing and extending this project, and it is a recommendation that this should be supported.

1CHAPTER 1 : BACKGROUND AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
 
1.1 Introduction 
This report describes the development of a fermentation process for the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor  directed toward the optimised production of fungal biomass and 
oxidative enzymes, and ultimately the bioremediation of phenolic-containing 
wastewaters. T. versicolor  is a common inhabitant of dead hardwoods in temperate 
climates where it causes a non-selective white rot decay. The lignolytic enzymes of this 
fungus have broad substrate specificity and have been implicated in the transformation 
of organopollutants with structural similarities to lignin.  
Much industrial pollution can be traced to waste-management practices that involve disposal rather than treatment , or to accidental or inci dental spillages that may be 
ignored in terms of non-existent, ineffective or uninformed environmental protection legislation. However, present legislation is increasingly designed both to ameliorate the 
adverse effects of past pollution, and to requi re immediate action to minimise the impact 
when industrial accidents producing new pollution do occur. A general consensus has emerged that the traditional “dilute, bury or burn” practice is no longer acceptable. To 
enable industrial companies to operate within increasingly stringent laws, the technology 
for pollution control must be made available. The challenge to biotechnology is to 
generate efficient, cost effective and envir onmentally safe bioremediation methods to 
replace existing technologies such as incinerat ion, as well as to provide unique solutions 
for the remediation of contaminated sites.  
During the past two decades certain white rot fungi (WRF) have been extensively studied in order to exploit their potential in producing enzymes that generate 
extracellular oxidative radicals for biotec hnological applications (Schlosser, 1997). The 
WRF are one of the few groups of microorganisms that can degrade lignin. They produce two types of extra-cellular metalloproteins with lignolytic activities: laccases and peroxidases (Pointing, 2001). The random nature of the structure of lignin requires lignin 
degradation to function in a non-specific manner; consequently, other compounds that have an aromatic structure, such as many xenobiotic compounds, are also highly 
susceptible to degradation by lignolytic enzymes.   
  
2T. versicolor is one of the more extensively studied white rot fungi. It produces a group of 
enzymes containing various laccase (E.C. 1.10.3.2) isozymes, as well as other 
peroxidases e.g. lignin peroxidase (LiP, E.C. 1.11.1.14) and manganese peroxidase 
(MnP, E.C. 1.11.1.13). Low concentrations of the enzymes are produced constitutively in submerged culture, while increased amounts are induced by aromatic compounds such 
as xylidine and ferulic acid (C ollins and Dobson, 1996 Galhaup et al., 2002).  In addition, 
while most other WRF’s only produce their oxidative enzymes under conditions of 
nutrient limitation or stress, T. versicolor  produces high levels of these enzymes under a 
regime of nutrient supplementation i.e. rapid growth conditions. This results in high total quantities of enzyme being produced. These enzymes are extracellular, and this allows high concentrations of pollutants to be detoxified without requiring the transport of 
substrates into cells. The enzymes are relatively non-specific with regard to aromatic pollutant structure, and thus a monoculture of the fungus can degrade a wide range of 
pollutants as opposed to a consortium of microorganisms that might be required in 
alternative processes. In a bioremediation process involving a WRF, this would allow for 
uncomplicated re-inoculation from stock cultures after a process upset. It also allows for 
better prediction of the fate of the pollutants. 
 
1.2.1 The white rot fungus Trametes versicolor 
Trametes versicolor belongs to a poroid family of the order Aphyllophorales, which is a 
class of the subdivision Basidiomycot ina, division Eumycota. The fungus  is described as 
a polypore, due to its polymorphic gross general morphology. Generative hyphae are of 
unlimited growth, possessing abundant protoplasmic contents; their wall is initially thin but may ultimately become thickened or gelatinised. Also present are specialised 
branches called skeletal and binding hyphae. Skeletal hyphae convey mechanical 
strength to the mycelial structure (Ainsworth et. al., 1973). T. versicolor is a tetrapolar 
heterokaryon and each dikaryotic cell contains two non-identical nuclei derived from the 
fusion of two different, sexually compatible primary mycelia, each bearing a single 
nucleus per cell. The dikaryotic mycelia become pigmented in culture, producing brown exudates and darkening some softwoods during decay. 
 The mycelia of wood decay fungi operate in a dynamic environment. As a result, they 
exhibit considerable spatial and temporal differences in metabolic functioning related to 
their developmental state. Fungi are able to adopt and switch between a variety of  
  
3distinct programmed morphogentic cycles, wh ich confer versatility and help the organism 
deal with local episodic pressures. It is not clear how much of this ‘developmental 
plasticity’ in fungi can be attributed to microenvironmental effects and how much to a 
selection of pre- and post-translational switch mechanisms. Even on relatively homogeneous laboratory medium, interconver tible morphs are frequently evident 
including slow-dense/fast-effuse and aerial versus  appressed or submerged growth 
(White and Boddy, 1992b).   Switching between modes can be correlated to different colonisation strategies. Many Basidiomyc etes have two obviously different colony 
morphs: the first is characterised by extensive, white woolly aerial mycelia; the second is 
often darkly pigmented, more tolerant of adverse conditions and has greater enzyme activity. There are differences in extracellular enzyme production between different 
modes (Sharland, 1986).  The hyphae at the margin are orientated toward rapid extension; a mode that in nature may lead to  early establishment in wood i.e. primary 
resource capture. The septate mode is adapted to replacing other fungi and defending 
territory (White and Boddy, 1992b). Elevated levels of laccase in T. versicolor  have been 
correlated with the slowest extension rate and low biomass production on solid culture, 
and there is some evidence that rate and/or extent of mycelial out-growth from wood are 
inversely related (Wells and Boddy, 1990).    
 
Despite extensive investigation, the exact biological role of laccase and peroxidases has not been irrefutably determined and therefor e few conclusions regarding their production 
can be made. Laccase has been implicated in many processes but patterns of enzyme production may simply reflect a physiological need for changes in carbon flow associated with new physiological activities. It has also been speculated that some form of 
metabolic coupling to phenoloxidases occurs in fungi during periods when endogenous 
metabolism cannot keep up with cellular demands (White and Boddy, 1992b). Rayner et 
al., (1987) suggested that a series of superimposable switch mechanisms, rather than 
genetic heterogeneity, control contrasting patterns of cellular growth, This control mechanism confers on the individual fungus a developmental versatility that enables the 
organism to survive the changing, and often discontinuous, niches it occupies in nature.

1.2.2 The effect of nutrition and culture conditions on enzyme production in 
 T. versicolor 
Three extracellular fungal enzymes cause changes in lignin and lignin model compounds: laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP). T. 
versicolor  produces all of these enzymes, although typically for their occurrence in T. 
versicolor  there seems to be large variability between strains which may reflect the 
inherent heterogeneity of this species. Cultur e conditions are important in the production 
of lignolytic enzymes in this and other species. Rogalski et al. (1991) concluded that “the 
optimum culture conditions for the production of lignolytic enzymes and thus probably also for the degradation of lignin should be individually chosen for each strain of Trametes versicolor ”.  Kaal et al. (1995) demonstrated that higher biomass and lignolytic 
enzyme activities were observed in response to organic nitrogen-sufficient conditions. 
Collins and Dobson (1995) investigated a T. versicolor  strain that reached maximal LiP 
activity when cultured in carbon-rich conditi ons (10 g/L glucose), a similar increase in 
MnP was also recorded.  
 
Schlosser et al . (1997) investigated the growth of T. versicolor  on wheat straw and 
beech wood compared to glucose. Growth on the lignocellulosic substrates led to a 3.5 fold increase in extracellular laccase activity in comparison with growth on glucose. However, the corresponding yields in biomass reached only about 20% of the value 
obtained on glucose. MnP activity appeared during growth on both wheat straw and 
beech, but not in cultures grown on glucose, even when the glucose in the medium was 
depleted. It was obvious that the efficiency (in terms of amount of enzyme produced 
relative to biomass) of the mycelia during growth on lignocellulosic substrates was much greater than that on glucose. During growth, the mycelial mats always developed on the 
surface of the cultures, whereas the solid substrates settled at the bottom of the flasks. 
Thus there was no contact between the mycelia and the wheat straw or beech chips. 
Intracellular laccase was reported in all three culture regimes (glucose, straw, beech wood) and, in assaying oxidation rates, the op timal pH values were found to be different 
from those of the extracellular form. However, in each case, much higher laccase activity 
was recovered from the culture filtrates. The origin of the intracellular laccases detected 
may have been due to extracellular laccase(s) before their secretion, or by ‘true’ intracellular laccase(s), or a combination of both. Obviously more information on the  
  
5regulation of laccase synthesis and activity as well as on physiological function and 
localisation within subcellular compartments is required 
 In WRF other than T. versicolor , enzyme production often occurs only under conditions 
of nutrient limitation. However, under these conditions, only low biomass yields are possible and therefore the enzymes can only be produced in low total quantities. This situation is far from ideal from a biotechnology standpoint. If these enzymes find a 
commercial application, it will be necessar y to produce them in large quantities. Hence 
there is a very real advantage in the fact that T. versicolor  has the potential to produce 
high levels of lignolytic enzymes under nutrient  sufficient (rapid growth) conditions.    
 
1.3.1 Laccase enzymes 
Among the more than 60 laccases isolated from various plant, insect, bacterial and 
fungal sources, the T. versicolor enzyme is one of the best studied in terms of molecular 
properties and enzymology. The laccase molecule, in active holoenzyme form, is a 
dimeric or tetrameric glycoprotein usually  containing four copper atoms per monomer, 
bound to three redox sites (Type 1,2 and 3 Cu pairs). The four Cu atoms differ from each other in their characteristic electronic par amagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. Two of 
them belong to the strongly coupled Type 3 site, with an EPR signal usually activated by strong anion binding. Types 1 and Type 2 Cu atoms have strong electronic absorption 
and well characterised EPR signals (Gianfreda et al., 1999). 
 
Laccase catalysis is believed to comprise three major steps: 
 
1. Type 1 Cu reduction by the reducing substrate. 2. Internal electron transfer from Type 1 Cu to Type 2 and Type 3 Cu trinuclear cluster. 
3. O
2 reduction (to water) at Type 2 and Type 3 Cu (Thurston, 1994; Yarapolov et al., 
1994). 
 Various physical characterisations have indicated that the Type 2 and Type 3 Cu in 
laccase form a trinuclear cluster, the site where the electrons from the reducing 
substrate (coming via the Type 1 Cu) are enzymatically transferred to O
2 to form H 2O. 
Experimental evidence supports a scheme in which the O 2 molecule firsts binds to the 
Type 2 and one of the Type 3 Cu to undergo “asymmetric” activation. The O 2 binding  
  
6pocket appears to restrict the access of oxidising agents other than O 2 (Gianfreda et al., 
1999).  
 
The oxidation of a reducing substrate usually involves the formation of a free (cation) radical after the transfer of a single electron to laccase. The radical can further undergo 
laccase-catalysed oxidation e.g. to form a quinone product from phenol or non-enzymic reactions (e.g. hydration or polymerisation). Oxidation can be controlled by redox 
potential differences between the reducing substrate and the type 1 Cu in laccase (Xu, 1997). A lower oxidation potential of the substrate often results in a higher rate for 
substrate oxidation. The substrate specificity  and affinity of laccase can vary with 
changes in pH. For substrates whose oxidation does not involve proton exchange (such 
as ferrocyanide), the laccase activity often decreases as pH increases. However, in the case of those substrates involving proton exchange (such as phenol), the pH activity 
profile of laccase can exhibit an optimal pH, which is dependent on the laccase rather 
than substrate (Bourbonnais and Paice, 1992). The difference in pH-activity profiles is 
attributed to the balance of two opposing effects: one generated by the redox potential 
difference between a reducing substrate and the Type 1 Cu of laccase (which correlates 
to the electron transfer rate and is favoured for a phenolic substrate by higher pH), and 
the other generated by the binding of an hydroxide anion to the Type 2/ Type 3 Cu of 
laccase (which inhibits activity at higher pH). Under turnover conditions the rate-limiting step is most likely substrate oxidation, whereas under transient or anaerobic conditions, 
the internal electron transfer step may become rate limiting (Gianfreda et al., 1999). In 
general the phenol oxidase activity of laccase has a bell-shaped (biphasic) pH profile 
whose optimal pH varies considerably among different laccases (Xu, 1997). 
 Laccases can be inhibited by various reagents, particularly by small anions such as 
halides, azide, cyanide and hydroxide which bind to the Type 2 and Type 3 Cu, resulting 
in the interruption of the internal electr on transfer and hence inhibition. Laccase inhibition 
by OH
- can dominate catalysis at alkaline pH. Laccases are, in fact, more stable at 
alkaline than at acidic pH due to the OH- inhibition of autooxidation. Both the Type 1 and 
Type 2 Cu can be extracted reversibly in the presence of copper chelator and reducing (or sulfhydryl) reagents.  Laccases can exhibit a thermal activation with apparent 
activation energy of 30-60 kJ/mol (Gianfreda et. al ., 1999). Laccases are generally 
thermostable under physiological conditions, although this varies according to source. A  
  
7laccase that retains its full activity at a reaction temperature of 70 C has recently been 
isolated (J Jordaan, 2003 pers comm). 
 
1.3.2 Production of laccases 
Several fungal strains and their diverse muta nts have been investigated for their ability to 
produce laccases. However, production of the enzyme is dependent not only on the 
strain but also on the growth conditions employed. These factors include: the presence 
or absence of inducers, induction time, nature and composition of culture medium, type of culture conditions (static/shaking etc.), and genetic manipulation. Among these 
factors, the presence of an inducer, its chemical nature, the amount added, and the time of its addition influence laccase production to the greatest extent. Laccases may be 
constitutive or inducible enzymes and several compounds have been shown to induce and improve laccase formation. These include, mainly, phenolic compounds related to 
lignin or lignin derivatives. However non-ligninic compounds and extracts from different 
sources have also been found to be effective (Gianfreda et al., 1999).  
 
Addition of 2,5-xylidine has been found to stimulate laccase enzyme production in many 
basidiomycete fungi, including T. versicolor  (Rogalski et al., 1991), but no effect and 
even inhibition has been noted when this compound was added to other strains. Other 
aromatic compounds including substituted phenols, acids and anilenes have been tested 
as laccase inducers. o-Anisidine has been demonstrated to cause a 62-fold increase in 
laccase production in T. versicolor  (Shuttleworth et al., 1986b). Ferulic acid doubled the 
production of the enzyme in T. versicolor . Veratryl alcohol (3,4 dimethoxybenzyl alcohol) 
can be oxidised by laccase and seems to have important functions in the degradation of lignin, it exerts a positive effect on the production of the enzyme in several fungi; T. 
versicolor  produced two to three times more laccase when supplemented with 1mM 
veratryl alcohol (Rogalski et al., 1991)  
 
Oxygen has been found to have an enhancing effect on many on lignin degradation by 
white rot fungi and many strains have to be periodically flushed with pure oxygen to 
ensure effective enzyme production. Laccase uses two molecules of oxygen as its primary substrate but Collins and Dobson (1997) report that purging T. versicolor  
cultures with 100% oxygen during growth had no effect on either lcc mRNA or laccase 
activity levels.  
  
8Vinasse, the wastewater produced in alcohol fermentation processes, showed good 
ability to enhance the production of extracellular laccase in T. versicolor . Other extracts 
from agricultural and industrial wastes e.g. cotton stalk extracts, barley and corn straw, potato waste and malt extract also increased laccase production T. versicolor . 
Surfactants have also been shown to increase laccase production (Gianfreda et al ., 
1999). Induction effect does not always parallel inducer concentration. When xylidene 
was added to a P. radiata  culture up to a concentration of 1mmol/L, laccase production 
was completely stopped, but it was very effective at concentrations 5 times lower 
(Rogalski et al., 1991). In contrast, benzyl alcohol did not stimulate laccase production at 
a concentration of 20 µmol/L, but was very ef fective at a concentration 10 times higher. 
The effectiveness of the inducer is also dependent on the time of inducer addition.  
 
1.3.3 Regulation of laccase production 
Fungi possess numerous pathways for what can be described as ‘dispensable’ 
metabolic functions. This term is used to describe pathways that are not required for 
growth, or only required for growth under limiting conditions and are typically expressed 
to enhance survival in response to nutrient deprivation or competing organisms. Nutrient 
utilization pathways i ncrease the metabolic versatility of  filamentous fungi , enabling them 
to utilise a variety of complex compounds as alternative sources of nutrients. Catabolic pathways are essential for survival under limiting nutrient conditions. Fungi have developed complex regulatory systems to ensure that the required pathways are 
expressed appropriately in response to changing conditions and to limit depletion of cellular resources due to unnecessary expression (Keller and Hohn, 1997).  This applies 
to laccases from T. versicolor  in a number of situations that are related to the diverse 
physiological roles of the enzyme. 
 
In white rot fungi, laccases are secreted as a number of isozymes encoded by different gene families. Laccase genes from a nu mber of lignolyti c fungi, including T. versicolor , 
have previously been cloned and characterised. It has been suggested that genes encoding various isozymes are differentially regulated, with some being constitutively 
expressed and others bei ng inducible (Collins and Dobs on, 1997). Collins and Dobson 
(1997) used reverse transcription PCR as a tool to determine the effects on lcc mRNA 
levels when the fungus was cultivated under a variety of physiological conditions. 
Copper regulates lcc transcription in T. versicolor.  As the copper concentration in the  
  
9growth medium increased, increased levels of lcc mRNA transcript levels were 
observed, with concomitant increases in laccase activities. This is not surprising since 
laccase contains 4 copper atoms per molecule that are essential for its activity. In 
induced cultures, the presence of laccase protein correlated with an increase in laccase activity when copper was present in the growth medium; no activity was detected in 
cultures that did not contain copper. The lik ely explanation is that the enzyme remains 
inactive in these cultures because copper is not available for incorporation to produce 
functional laccase enzyme (C ollins and Dobson, 1997). 
 
LiP and MnP production in P. chrysosporium  is stimulated by limiting nitrogen 
concentrations, and this has been shown to involve regulation at the level of gene 
transcription. In contrast, higher MnP and LiP titers have been observed in other white rot fungal species at high levels of nitrogen. Collins and Dobson (1997) demonstrated 
that nitrogen-induced laccase production in T. versicolor  at the level of transcription. 
When nitrogen was provided to the fungus at increasing concentrations, corresponding increases in lcc mRNA and laccase activity were observed. Hence, it seems that 
nitrogen is an important factor in regulating expression of the three major lignolytic 
enzymes in the white rot fungi.  
 
2,5-xylidine (XYL), ferulic acid and veratric acid have all been previously reported as laccase inducers. Collins a nd Dobson (1997) investigated their ability, along with 1- 
hydroxybezatriole (HBT), a laccase mediator, to induce lcc transcription. They found that 
only HBT and XYL induced transcription, and the mechanism by which these aromatic 
compounds activate lcc transcription is not understood. These compounds are toxic to 
fungi and a concentration in the growth medium above 2 mM, no fungal growth occurs. 
Thurston (1994) has suggested that one function of laccases is to detoxify reactive 
aromatic compounds by polymerising them. Therefore it is possible that lcc induction by 
XYL and HBT is indicative of a response developed by fungi to oxidize, and hence 
reduce the toxic effects, of such compounds.  The induction of laccase production in various fungi appears to be specific for certain aromatic compounds; consequently, 
specific mechanisms for transcriptional activati on are likely to be involved (Collins and 
Dobson, 1997).      
   
  
101.3.4 Protein secretion in  filamentous organisms 
Fungal hyphae and their branches are compartmentalised by simple or complex porous 
septa that allow passage of nutrients, cell components and organelles. Thus, the 
cytoplasm within a fungal mycelium operates in a continuous system. Protein secretion 
in filamentous organisms is restricted to the growing hyphal tip. Even the secretion of 
lignolytic enzymes of P. chrysosporium , a process that is not growth-associated, was 
shown to occur only at the tips of new hyphal branches.  
 
1.4 Substrates susceptible to degradation by T. versicolor 
The pathways in T. versicolor for the oxidation of phenolic compounds and other 
environmental pollutants related to constituents of the lignin molecule, produce the  
corresponding quinones and subsequent polymerisation reactions. Subsequently, an intracellular heme-flavin adenine dinucleotide  (FAD)-cofactored glycoprotein designated 
cellobiose dehydrogenase (CBH), donates electrons to an extremely wide range of 
substrates including semi-quinones, ortho- and para-quinones, azo dyes, kraft lignins, 
Fe(III), MnO
2 and Mn(III) complexes (Roy et al., 1996). The quinone, hydroquinone and 
catechol reaction products can again serve as substrates for the oxidative enzymes. This ubiquitous red-ox cycle of phenolic compounds includes intra- and extra-cellular 
processes and is not yet fully understood.  The rapid intracellular metabolism of the 
quinone and hydroquinone intermediates is a possible mechanism for shifting the dynamic polymerisation/depolymerisation equilibrium towards degradation and 
mineralisation (Schlosser et al., 1997).   
 1.4.1 Phenols 
Phenols are widely distributed in nature, where they occur naturally and as man-made 
aromatic compounds.  Phenolic compounds enter the environment as intermediates 
during the biodegradation of natural polymers containing aromatic rings or during the 
biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds (Van Schie and Young, 1998).  Phenol itself is 
not readily biodegradable and is toxic to most types of microorganisms even at low concentration. It can be inhibitory to the growth of even those species that have the 
metabolic capacity of using it as a carbon source. Phenol can be toxic or lethal to fish at concentrations as low as 5-25mg/L. It also contributes to off-flavours in drinking and 
food-processing waters. Although not found to be bioaccumulative in humans, 
individuals exposed to phenol at concentrations of 1300mg/L present symptoms of  
  
11diarrhoea, mouth sores, dark urine and burning of the mouth (Annachhatre and 
Gheewala, 1996) 
 
The biodegradability of aromatic compou nds depends on the number, type and position 
of substituents on the aromatic ring. The relative order of biodegradability appears to 
correspond to ortho >meta >para  positions of the substituents. Anomalies to this order 
have been found, and differences in the ability of microorganisms to degrade aromatic compounds could well depend on the environmental conditions under which they act (Annachhatre and Gheewala, 1996) 
 
1.4.2 Chlorophenols 
Chlorophenols are components of the absorbable organic halides (AOX) present in the 
bleaching effluents from the pulp and paper indus try. Aqueous effluents from industrial 
operations such as polymeric resin production, oil refining, and coking plants also contain chlorophenolic compounds. They are used as fungicides and may be formed 
from the hydrolysis of chlorinated phen oxyacetic acid herbicides. Pentachlorophenol 
(PCP) is the second most heavily used pesticide in the US, with approximately 1.25 million tons produced annually (Annachhatre and Gheewala, 1996). Soil in the vicinity of 
wood preserving facilities using PCP as a fu ngicide has been found to contain up to 1g 
PCP/kg (Annachhatre and Gheewala, 1996). The toxicity and bioaccumulative potential 
of chlorophenols increases with degree of chlorination and with lipophilicity. 
Bioaccumulation potential, quantified by the bioconcentration factor (BCF), is positively 
correlated to the octonal- water partition coefficient (K
ow). When PCP enters previously 
uncontaminated streams at conc entrations of 4 ppb, fish-k ill occurs. Phenol and most 
chlorophenolic compounds can induce mutations in certain bacteria and yeasts. 
Chlorophenols are considerably persistent in soils and are prone to leaching into the 
water table. Partial degradation of these compounds produces metabolites such as 
chlorocatechols or chlorosubstituted ring fission products that severely inhibit growth and 
development of haloaromatic utilising organisms (Annachhatre and Gheewala, 1996).  
The oxidative enzymes secreted by white-rot fungi to extracellularly degrade lignin in wood have been linked to the initial degradative reactions of chlorinated aromatic 
compounds (Alleman et al. , 1995; Logan et al. , 1994). The use of microbial or enzyme-
based treatment offers some distinct advantages over physical and chemical AOX  
  
12precipitation/absorption/filtration removal methods, in that only catalytic and not 
stoichiometric amounts of the reagents are required and the low organic concentrations 
and large volumes typical of bleachery effluents are therefore less of a problem. Also, 
both complete microbial systems and isolated peroxidase and laccase enzymes have 
been shown to reduce acute toxicity by polymerizing, and thereby rendering less soluble, 
many of the low-molecular weight non-chlorinated and polychlorinated phenolics (Roy-Arcand and Archibald, 1991).  
 
Chadwick-Roper et al.  (1995) investigated the effect of addition of co-substrates such as 
guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol on the removal of chlorinated phenols by a laccase 
from T. versicolor . They found that addition of 50mM guaiacol enhanced the precipitation 
of 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with laccase by 20, 32 
and 80% respectively; while addition of 10mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol enhanced the 
precipitation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol by 98%.   This co-precipitation may not require the 
presence of enzyme once the co-substrate is oxidised to reactive intermediates. These authors concluded that the observed phenomenon may be a useful strategy for 
improving the efficiency of enzymatic decontamination methods, particularly in the case 
of heterogeneous pollution.   
 
Alleman et al., (1995) demonstrated that toxicity is accurately quantified by the principle 
of chemical dose, the ratio of mass of chemical to the mass of mycelia, rather than by 
solution concentration. They showed that Trametes versicolor  was the fastest growing of 
six commonly studied WRF able to remain viable at higher PCP doses, produced the 
most biomass after addition of PCP, and remained viable when grown on nutrient 
deficient and sufficient media.   1.4.3 Polychlorinated biphenyls 
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are produced by  chlorination of biphenyl, resulting in 
up to 209 different congeners. Commercial mixtures range from light oily fluids to waxes, and their physical properties make them useful as heat transfer fluids, solvent extenders, 
plasticisers, flame-re tardants, organic diluents and diel ectric fluids. The stability and 
hydrophobic nature of these compounds make them a persistent environmental hazard 
(Beaudette et al., 1998). Mineralisation of PCB’s was first reported by Eaton (1985), who 
investigated the degradation of Aroclor 1254,  a recalcitrant mixture of biphenyls  
  
13chlorinated up to 54% (w/w) and containing 4-7 chlorine atoms per biphenyl. Chlorine 
substitution affects to some extent the oxidative attack by fungal enzyme systems, but 
not as much as bacterial dioxygenases, possibly due to the free radical mode of action (Novotny et al. , 1997). Extensive degradation of lesser-chlorinated PCBs was observed 
under both low-N and high-N conditions. Th e white-rot fungi showed the ability to 
degrade Aroclor 1254 mixture (PCB) after idiophasic metabolism was switched on by nitrogen limitation (Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995).    
 
1.4.4 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
PAHs are compounds composed of fused benzene rings in linear, angular and cluster 
arrangements and are mainly formed as products of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels  (Collins et al. , 1996). Some of them are considered heterocyclic molecules due to 
the substitution in an aromatic ring carbon by nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur (Muncnerova & Augustin, 1994). PAHs are highly hazardous pollutants found widely distributed in terrestrial and aquatic environments (Anderson & Henrysson, 1996; Collins et al. , 1996; 
Muncnerova & Augustin, 1994).  Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995).  Some are acutely 
toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic (Collins et al., 1996). 
 
Although anthracene and other members of the PAH group can easily be oxidised, they 
have nothing in common with typical substrate for laccase. The unexpected catalytic 
oxidation of anthracene in vitro  was increased by the application of laccase with 
compounds forming readily available stable radicals (Johannes et al ., 1996). For the 
oxidation of anthracene to anthraquinone the presence of a mediator is essential, an ABTS mediator system achieved this with  a 90 % transformation efficiency (Johannes et 
al., 1996). These conditions were previously also shown to be necessary for the 
oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde through the laccase/ABTS system.    It is believed that in vivo cultures of T. versicolor  produce their own natural mediators, 
thereby broadening the laccase substrate range. The radicals of the mediator compound 
itself play no direct role in the abstraction of an electron or hydrogen atom from the anthracene and their action can only be detected by possible recombination with the 
anthracene intermediate radical, resulting in coupling products.    
  
141.4.5 BTEX 
BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), are a group of common organo-pollutants derived from gasoline and aviation fuels. Degradation of these compounds by T. versicolor occurs under non-lignolytic culture conditions in a nitrogen-rich medium 
(Alleman et al. , 1995; Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995).   Degradation was recorded after 
only 5 days of incubation. Benzene was reduced by 18%, toluene by 41%, ethyl-
benzene by 99%, o-xylene by 49%, and m-xylene and p-xylene by 67% (Paszczynski & 
Crawford, 1995).  
  
1.4.6 Dyes 
Large amounts of structurally diverse dyestuffs are used for the textile, paper and leather 
industries. Dyes are classified on the basis of their chemical structure, with azo-dyes commercially the most important followed by  phthalocyanines, used for the production of 
green and blue pigments (Hienfling et al. , 1997). Azo-dyes are characterised by the 
presence of a chromophoric azo group whose nitrogen atoms are linked to sp
2-
hybridised carbon atoms of the aromatic ring, which may also carry sulphonic acid groups. Sulpho- and azo- groups are not naturally occurring; thus, sulphonated azo dyes 
are recalcitrant to biodegradation.   In the case of reactive dyes, up to 50% of the dye is 
lost through hydrolysis during the dying process and therefore appears in the 
wastewater. The recalcitrant synthetic dyestuffs are hardly removed from effluents by 
conventional wastewater biological treatments, such as activated sludge (Hienfling et al. , 
1997; Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995).  Textil e-processing effluents also contain heavy 
metal ions, which may arise from materials used in the dying process or, in considerably 
higher amounts, from metal-containing dyes (Hienfling et al.,  1997).  
 
In various studies, lignocellulolytic fungi were shown to attack not only natural and 
industrial lignin derivatives but also a broad range of organopollutants, including various 
dyes. Studies have shown the degradation of  azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic and 
polymeric dyes by P. chrysosporium  (Heinfling et al. , 1997). Swamy and Ramsay (1999) 
found that T. versicolor  displayed the greatest decolouration ability both in terms of 
extent and rapidity of decolourisation. In general, the overall complexity of structure 
alone was not an indicator of the difficulty of  decolouration of a particular dye. In 
addition, only T. versicolor  sustained high rates of decolouration of repeated, sequential  
  
15additions of a number of different dyes and  dye mixtures. The eventual cessation of 
decolouration was most likely due to nutrient depletion (Swamy and Ramsay, 1999).  
 
1.4.7 Nitro-Substituted Compounds 
Most nitro-substituted compounds of interest, in terms of fungal bioremediation, belong 
to a larger group of explosive chemicals t hat also encompasses nitrate esters and nitro-
amines, along with derivatives of chloric acid, perchloric acid, azides and other 
compounds (Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995). The toxicity and mutagenicity of nitro-aromatics and their recalcitrance to biodegradation underlie concerns about their 
environmental fate (Paszczynski & Crawford, 1995).    
1.4.8 Xylenols 
Xylenols (dimethylphenols) are major pollutants in waste-waters of industrial processes such as coal gasification and liquefication, and more are generated by sewage disposal 
and petroleum exhausts. Because of their strong bacteriocidal action, unpleasant taste 
and odor, and toxicity to fish and other organisms, their presence is considered 
undesirable in water resources, even at concentrations of only 1ppb (Liu and Bollag, 
1985).    When Liu and Bollag (1985) incubated syringic acid, 2,6- xylenol and laccase from T. versicolor  together, the primary reaction appeared to be the copolymerisation of 
the two substrates; no oligomers of syringic acid were detected and only a small amount of a quinone dimer of 2,6-xylenol was found.  Mechanistic investigations suggested that 
UDP-xylose and UDP-xylosyltransferase were involved in the reaction (Kondo et al.,  
1993). These authors showed that the xyloside formation activity of T. versicolor was 
activated by the exogenous addition of phenolic compounds in which guaiacol had the best stimulatory effect.  In addition to enzyme systems, however, many abiotic factors, such as free radicals, metals and clays, contribute to the oxidative cross-coupling of 
xenobiotics and cross coupling of xenobiotics with humic constituents in nature.  
 1.4.9 Kraft pulp bleaching and delignification 
The annual worldwide production of paper and board exceeds 300 million tons. As the 
pulp accounts for only about 40-45% of the original weight of the wood, effluent wastewaters carry an extremely heavy organic load (Annachatre and Gheewala, 1996).  
In response to environmental concerns and increasingly stringent emissions standards, the pulp and paper industry is seeking ways to  decrease the levels of chlorinated lignin  
  
16residues in its effluents, through both production process changes and improved 
treatment technologies (Addleman & Archibald, 1993). Considerable interest has 
focused on the white-rot basidiomycetes, si nce they are capable of preferential 
degradation of native lignins and the complete degradation of wood.  
 
The Kraft process, at present the most co mmon commercial chemical delignification 
method, produces a dark pulp because of the colour of the residual modified lignin 
residues. These are normally bleached or removed by the use of chlorine, chlorine 
dioxide and caustic (NaOH) extractions (Addleman  & Archibald, 1993). The ability of T. 
versicolor  to bleach kraft pulps was first shown by its remarkable brightening effect on 
suspensions of hardwood kraft pulp.  The brightness increase was accompanied by a decrease in kappa number (lignin content) of the pulp (Addleman et al. , 1995). 
Subsequently, T. versicolor  was found to brighten and delignify softwood kraft pulps and 
also pulps produced by extended or oxygen delignification.  
 
Residual lignin, the fraction remaining after the pulp has been subjected to the Kraft process, is still susceptible  to biodegradation by T. versicolor ; some of it is solubilised 
and a smaller fraction mineralised. One of t he early events is the release of methanol 
from the methoxy groups on rings bearing a free phenolic hydroxyl group (Paice et al. , 
1993). Biological bleaching of kraft pulp by T. versicolor  is carried out by the organism’s 
extracellular delignification system. The components of the system, enzymes and 
mediators, interact with the pulp structure at a molecular level. Unbleached kraft pulp is 
the most common substrate for biological or enzymatic bleaching experiments. The pulp pore sizes suggest easy penetration by small molecule mediators for lignolytic enzymes 
like ABTS or manganese oxalate. It seems likely that the oxidised ABTS must function as a diffusable electron carrier, because laccase is a large molecule (M
w ~ 70 000kD) 
and therefore cannot enter the secondary wall to contact the lignin substrate directly. It is postulated that ABTS can couple with phenolic groups in lignin to form hydrophilic lignin-
ABTS complexes, can promote C
a-Cb cleavage of non-phenolic sites in lignin and can 
diffuse into regions inaccessible to enzymes. This would further increase the delignifying and depolymerising activity of the laccase-ABTS system (Addleman et al. , 1995) 
 It is widely reported that their unique enzyme suites enable white rot fungi to effectively degrade native lignin. These fungi also facilit ate degradation of chlorolignins. However,  
  
17they are less suitable for treatment of other pulp mill lignins such as lignosulfonates, the 
EOP lignins and monomeric lignin derivatives (Bergbauer and Eggert, 1993). Since 
laccase is known to polymerise a wide variety of monomeric and polymeric lignin derivatives, the high laccase secretion by T. versicolor,  together with easily polymerised 
substrates, may play a key role in preventing effective degradation of EOP lignins. The results obtained with chlorolignins may be due to the chlorination of the aromatic ring facilitating radical breakdown and helping to pr event the polymerisation reactions that 
would inhibit degradation. In addition, the ratio of laccase to peroxide activity of T. 
versicolor  incubated with lignosulphonates or EOP lignins was 3 times higher than it was 
for a chlorine bleachery effluent (Bergbauer and Eggert, 1993). 
 
Treatments of pulp with laccase-ABTS, followed by alkaline extraction, decreased the kappa number of softwood kraft pulp by 55%. Although this system is highly efficient, a 
commercial application does not seem feasible. Due to the scale of pulp bleaching, even if the ABTS was manufactured in bulk, the costs would be too high (Archibald et al.,  
1997).  
 1.5 Bioreactors for the application of T rametes  systems 
The reduction of chemical residues such as  phenols is an area of environmental 
concern. Conventional physico-chemical trea tments, although effective, suffer from 
numerous drawbacks as discussed above. An appropriate biological treatment of 
contaminated waste streams with a robust biosystem that meets industrial requirements 
could potentially provide a less energy- and capital-intensive approach to achieving the necessary reduction of phenolic compounds. Although bioremediation is already an 
established technology, almost all currently employed treatments use prokaryotes and comparatively little attention has been given to the use of WRF in bioreactors (Pointing, 
2001). Large scale, cost-effective application of these fungi to continuous treatment of 
liquid effluent has been hindered by the lack of suitable bioreactor systems. 
 A bioreactor is essentially a container in which a production process is carried out. The 
primary task of a bioreactor is mixing, the central objective of which is to provide a 
largely homogeneous chemical and physical environment in which all the cells are 
operating at their optimum with respect to the desired biochemical conversion. Mixing in 
the wider sense includes providing cells in aerobic culture with sufficient oxygen,  
  
18removing potentially harmful metabolites, and keeping the culture temperature within 
tolerable limits around its optimal value. Stirred tanks are the most common aerobic 
reactors used in commercial productive fermentations. Their design dates back to the early penicillin productions of t he 1940’s. Airlift reactors, in which all agitation is due to 
bubbling gas, are a relatively new invention. Other reactor designs routinely employed in 
fungal bioprocesses are: fixed or fluidized beds and immobilized biofilms, either in membrane systems, trickle beds or rotating biological contactors.  
 Over the past decade the white rot fungi have been extensively studied for their ability to 
degrade a broad range of xenobiotic organo-pollutants. While the bioremediation potential of these microorganisms is undoubted, nearly all the research undertaken in 
this regard has been has been done on an analytical level. Static or shake flask degradation experiments with 50-100mL volumes of culture fluid and target compound 
predominate. Furthermore, very little work has been done on authentic effluents as 
opposed to chemically pure model compounds. 
 
1.6.1 Immobilised biofilm reactors 
Solid–liquid mass transfer is known to control performance of many multiphase reactors. 
Mechanically agitated cultures are known to hav e an inhibitory effect on the production 
of lignolytic enzymes by white rot fungi due to the shear stress suffered by the mycelia 
(Nakamura et al. , 1999). Enzyme production is further reduced by production of 
proteases that degrade extracellular enzymes and oxygen limitations within pellets. In 
addition, immobilisation makes it possible to in crease the mycelial-cultu re fluid interfacial 
contact area by preventing s edimentation and thus  increasing transfer. Systems utilising 
immobilised biofilms enhance solid-liquid mass transfer without generating the intense 
shear fields that tend to damage the biofilms. 
 A culture of the WRF Bjerkandera adusta  immobilized on polyurethane foam was more 
effective for the production of MnP and laccase than conventional static liquid culture 
(Nakamura et al.,  1999).  Alleman et al. (1995) constructed a bioreactor that simulated 
the cyclical conditions of fixed film reactors trickling filters and rotating biological 
contactors. It was found that T. versicolor  produced the greatest amount of biomass and 
PCP dehalogenation (10 g PCP/L) of the three WRF tested under these conditions. 
Biofilms of T. versicolor were also less susceptible to variations in wastewater feeds. The  
  
19use of P. chrysosporium  immobilized on a polyethylene disc in a rotating biological 
contactor resulted in an efficient degradation of 4-chlorophenol. The reactor system 
allowed the fungus to be, alternatively, in contact with the substrate in the liquid solution 
and with oxygen, improving the 4-chlorophenol removal compared to agitated culture 
(Zouari et al., 2002). A trickle bed reactor with biofilms of P. chrysosporium  supported on 
ceramic carriers facilitated enzyme (LiP) extr action by ultrafiltration from the circulating 
growth medium. Furthermore, a relatively simple regime of pulsing the feed flow 
controlled the productivity per unit volume of bioreactor (Ruggeri and Sassi, 2003).  1.6.2 Fluidised bed reactors 
Many bioprocesses make use of solid phase biocatalysts. The catalyst is usually 
suspended in a reactor–bubble column, stirred tank, fluidised bed or airlift device. Examples include suspensions of immobilised enzyme pellets and biofilms supported on 
suspended carriers. An effective bioreactor system directed toward the production of lignolytic enzymes should incorporate mild agitation conditions and good oxygen 
transfer. A fluidised bed system fulfils these requirements, but presents an additional 
problem in that the biomass is not suspended and is prone to the formation of 
preferential paths (channeling). This problem was overcome by the implementation of a 
pulsed flow regime that exerted peri odic shear on the biomass and so removed 
branching hyphae (Moreira et al., 1998). As a result, aggregation of agglomerates was 
avoided and important operational parameters such as aeration and nu trient availability 
were maximized. In this manner continuous MnP production from P. chrysosporium  was 
achieved over a long period (40 days).   
 T. versicolor  has also been grown in fluidised bed r eactors for the production of lignolytic 
enzymes and the bioremediation of bleach plant effluents and pentachlorophenol (Pallerla and Chambers, 1995, 1998). A 60 0 mL-scale fluidised bed system containing 
polymer-entrapped T. versicolor  in bead form was effective in the reduction of colour, 
chlorophenolics and absorbable organic halides from bleach plant effluents for an 
extended period (Pallerla and Chambers, 1995).  T. versicolor  was able to withstand 
higher concentrations in a fluidised bed react ors compared to static and agitated flask 
culture and a rotating biological contactor.  T he higher degradation levels obtained in the 
fluidised bed system were attributed to increased oxygen and PCP transfer, retention of 
higher mycelial loading and greater enzyme activities (Pallerla and Chambers, 1998).  
  
20 
1.6.3 Airlift loop reactors (ALR) 
Airlift reactors consist of a liquid pool divided into two distinct zones, one of which is 
sparged by a gas. The different gas holdup in the gassed and ungassed zones results in different bulk densities of the fluid in these  regions, which causes circulation in the 
reactor by a gas-lift action. The part of the reactor containing the gas-liquid upflow is the 
riser and the region containing the down-flow ing fluid is called the downcomer (Fig 1.1). 
A widened section at the top of the airlift is known as the gas disengagement zone. In 
this region the fluid velocity slows (velocity = flow rate/area) and as a result, bubbles rise 
less rapidly and have less kinetic energy. Cell damage, which occurs when bubbles 
explode at the surface, is thus reduced. Bubbles disengage from the liquid and proceed 
to the surface instead of returning down the downcomer. Thus CO
2- rich bubbles are 
removed from the reactor. The widening increases turbulence in the disengagement 
region and it has been suggested that this region plays an important role in the overall 
equalization of the reactor contents 
The major reason for the higher productivities of  airlift bioreactors (compared to stirred 
tank reactors) is that the draft tube distributes shear forces throughout the reactor. As a 
result, cells are not exposed to large variations in shear forces and thus are able to grow in a more stable physical environment. In contrast, in stirred tank reactors, high shear 
conditions arise near the impeller causing cell damage or cell stress, lowering 
productivity. Draft tubes also prevent bubble coalescence by causing bubbles to move in one direction.  
  
21
 
Fig 1.1 Schematic diagram of concentric draught-tube internal loop ALR 
Gas-mixed reactors do not have impellers to decrease bubble diameter and increase the 
volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (K La). To compensate for this, gas mixed 
reactors are designed with a larger height to diameter ratio so as to improve oxygen transfer efficiency by: 
(i) Increased hydrostatic pressure at the base of the reactor, which increases the 
saturation concentration of oxygen (C
o*). 
(ii) Increasing the time the bubbles spend in the reactor and thus increases the bubble residence time and gas hold-up. This increases the air volume in the reactor available 
for oxygen transfer and increases the time available for each bubble to transfer oxygen into the medium.  
Limits to reactor height develop because as the bubbles rise, they transfer out oxygen 
and receive carbon dioxide from the medium. If the reactor is too tall, bubbles at the top 
will be rich in carbon dioxide and poor in oxygen. The cells at the top of the reactor will 
therefore be starved of oxygen. Mixing time also increases with the reactor height. Thus a reactor that is too tall will suffer from ma ss transfer problems with cells in some areas 
being starved of oxygen for relatively long periods of time. A large mixing time makes process control difficult. For example, the pH may vary throughout the reactor, making it  
  
22difficult to determine when to add alkali and how much alkali to add. Construction costs 
also increase as the reactor height increases. 
 
With solid phase biocatalysts, a large quantity of the catalyst must usually be maintained in the suspension so that a high volumetric productivity is achieved (Figure 1.2). The fully 
suspended state must be attained at lower power inputs and low levels of turbulence. The airlift system is better in this regard than its competitors because most of the energy 
input into them goes to creating a highly directional flow of liquid, which helps to suspend solids. Solid suspension is further improved by increasing the aspect ratio (H/D), which 
in turn increases the induced circulation ra te. This also results in significant 
improvements in top to bottom fluid circulat ion that is often used to characterise mixing 
time. Compared to other low shear systems, such as bubble columns, airlift loop reactors (ALR) have significantly better solid-liquid mass transfer (Siegel et al.,  1986; Schugerl 
and Lubbert, 1994). High-density cultures typically increase productivity by orders of 
magnitude relative to free suspension culture (Chisti and Moo-Young, 1996). The 
negative aspects of high-density cultures include: a decrease in the specific productivity 
of the biocatalyst due to transport limitations , and problems of long term stability and the 
logistics of sterile manipulation.     Figure 1.2 Photograph of dense biomass  
in an airlift bioreactor 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Bonnarme et al.  (1993) cultivated P. chrysosporium  in both mechanically agitated stirred 
tank reactor (working volume 1.7 L) and pneumatic (airlift) bioreactor (working volume 2.2 L). In the airlift loop reactor, the yields of lignin and manganese peroxidases as well 
 
  
23as extracellular protein were greatly increased as compared with mechanically agitated 
bioreactors. The authors noted two distinct growth phases for the pneumatic reactors. 
During phase I, more biomass was formed in the airlift reactor than in the stirred tank (STR). During phase II, biomass decreased in the airlift reactor while steadily increasing in the STR. Extracellular protein production was increased 3.8 times in the non-
mechanically agitated reactor while lignolytic enzyme production was 6 to 9 times higher. Thus it appeared that the accumulation of biomass in the STR during phase II was at the 
expense of enzyme production. Protease activity was higher in the STR; this, in combination with the mechanical agitation, which is known to affect the secretion and 
stability of many enzymes, might partially explain the lower peroxidase titers obtained. 
The yield coefficients of the peroxidase enzymes were significantly higher in the airlift 
reactor than the STR demonstrating that in pneumatic reactors, the carbon and nitrogen 
consumption was orientated toward peroxidase synthesis at the expense of biomass. 
 
In the design of reactors to deal with biologi cal wastewaters, it is generally accepted that 
airlift loop reactors are the most economi cal with regard to the several important 
performance criteria (Siegel et al.,  1986; Schugerl and Lubbert, 1994):  
i) energetic oxygen transfer – almost twice as efficient as its nearest competitor 
(low depth clarification basin with surface aerators) 
ii) oxygen transfer rate 
iii) heat transfer – due to the strong circulatory motion the average flow velocities 
near the walls (cooling jackets) are higher. 
iv) application to large volume systems v) reduced power consumption with comparable/improved productivity relative to 
STR’s  (Schugerl and Lubbert, 1994) 
vi) decreased shear stress vii) extended aseptic operation (due to the elimination of stirrer shafts, seals and 
bearings) (Chisti and Moo-Young, 1987). 
 
1.7.1 Project objectives 
The broad aim of this project was to develop a reactor-based bioprocess utilising the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor  for the remediation of phenol-contaminated 
wastewaters. To this end it was necessary to first investigate the physiology of the organism in terms of laccase production and its response to the presence of phenols in  
  
24its environment.  T. versicolor  had been reported as an excellent producer of laccase but 
the successful application of this organism in a bioremediation process required the 
production of high amounts of this enzyme. The degree of success achieved in the 
laboratory in the mineralisation/ removal from solution of many major pollutants had so far only been realised in flask culture or in rather laboratory-specific reactor applications. 
A more practical (in terms of future scale-up) , cost effective reactor system that provided 
a well-oxygenated, yet low shear environment was required.  
 
1.7.2 Specific objectives 
To fulfill the aims outlined above, the following objectives were identified. 
1. Characterisation of the biological conversion by Trametes versicolor,  of the phenolics, 
chlorinated phenolics and polyaromatics present in these effluents.  This would 
include characterisation of the roles and activity levels of the enzyme activities 
involved, and the fate of the organic compounds converted.  
2. An optimised fermentation or fed-batch process in which the Trametes versicolor 
successfully degrades these pollutants. 
3. A laboratory scale bioreactor involving a pneumatic fermenter linked to a membrane 
module, with Trametes versicolor  growing and producing enzymes continuously at 
steady state with continuous operation of this system for a prolonged time to demonstrate its feasibility.  
4. Development of models of the biological reactions in terms of cell growth, enzyme 
production, biodegradation rates and the operation of the fermenter / membrane module bioreactor for bioremediation

25CHAPTER 2 : DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE METHODOLOGIES FOR TRAMETES 
SPECIES (Part 1): MEDIUM DEVELOPMENT 
 
2.1 Introduction 
The first steps in generating an efficient bior emediation process are the identification of a 
suitable microorganism and the optimisation of  the culture conditions necessary for its 
rapid growth and the production of the relevant enzymes. Often, aspects such as growth 
medium development are overlooked in favo ur of over-engineered, conventional or 
historically established formulations. The development of a simple, cost effective 
medium for the growth of T. versicolor and its production of laccase is discussed here. 
The genus Trametes  is chiefly recognised as the most efficient natural producer of 
laccase (Jang et al., 2002). Typically for the occurrence of this lignin-modifying enzyme 
in T. versicolor , there seems to be large variability between strains, which may reflect the 
inherent heterogeneity of this species. Neither lignin nor any pollutants degraded by 
these enzymes have been shown to be utili sed as growth substrates, and a separate 
carbon source is required for metabolism (Reddy, 1995).  
Culture conditions are important in the produc tion of lignolytic enzymes in this and other 
species of WRF. For example, the discovery of LiP in P. chrysosporium  in 1983 was the 
beginning of the extensive study of WRF and their ability to degrade xenobiotic organo-
pollutants that has continued ever since. P. chrysosporium  was regarded as a model 
organism in this field of research and because it only expresses lignolytic enzymes during secondary metabolism following growth, when carbon and/or nitrogen becomes limiting, the same was assumed for all other WR F. More recent work has found that this 
is not the case for Trametes species. Swamy and Ramsay (1999), in work on dye 
decolourisation, reported that the cessation of the process corresponded to glucose (carbon) depletion, but that replenishing t he glucose restored the decolourisation. They 
did, however, highlight the requirement for nitrogen limitation. Jang et al.  (2002) reported 
that N-rich cultures produced higher levels of  laccase activity in batch experiments. 
Galhaup et al.  (2002) showed that laccase production in T. pubescens  was stimulated by 
high concentrations of easily utilisable carbon and nitrogen. Nutrient requirements 
appear therefore to be dependent on both strain and function/environment of the fungus. 
   
  
26Three media have been used predominantly in recent work involving growth of 
T. versicolor : those of Kirk (Tien, 1987) Yoshitake (Kondo et al., 1994), and the 
Trametes Defined Medium (TDM) (Addleman and Archibald, 1993). The Yoshitake 
medium is both nitrogen (peptone 10 g/L) and glucose (30 g/l) rich. The Kirk medium is both nitrogen and carbon sufficient and TDM has both in only limiting quantities (6g/L 
glucose, 2.19g/L glutamine). These media were tested in terms of growth and enzyme 
production for the strain of T. versicolor  used in this study and were the starting point for 
the development of an optimised medium.  
 2.2 Methods 
 
2.2.1 Strain preservation 
A slant culture of T. versicolor (PPRI #3845)  was obtained from the Plant Protection 
Research Institute (South Africa). A culture of T. pubescens (CBS 696.94) was obtained 
from the Boku Institute in Austria. Both were maintained on 2% malt extract agar slants 
and subcultured every 60 days. 
 2.2.2 valuation of growth media 
Detailed recipes for all growth media appear in Appendix A. The glucose and thiamine solutions for all three media were filter sterilised and added after autoclaving to prevent 
caramelisation and denaturing respectively. The salt solution for the Trametes Defined 
Medium was also added subsequent to autocla ving, to prevent pos sible precipitation. 
 
2.2.3 Medium development 
Trametes Defined Medium (TDM) was used initially as the medium for the production of 
biomass and enzyme, with the glutamine replaced by peptone. The medium was further 
simplified by the omission of the dimethyl succinate and sodium and calcium chloride. 
The glucose (carbon source) and peptone (nit rogen source) concentrations were varied 
between 20 g/L (high) and 2 g/L (low), and the ‘nutrient sufficient’ medium contained 10 
g/L of each.   
  
272.2.4 Inoculation 
Pre-inoculum flasks were prepared by dicing two T. versicolor  plate cultures into 5 mm  
5 mm squares and adding them aseptically to 400 mL medium in a 2L flask. These 
flasks were incubated at 29°C in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm, with a glass bead in each to prevent a mycelial mat forming. After 4 d incubation, the contents of these flasks were 
homogenised in a sterile Sorvall bench top homogeniser. This was used as the inoculum for the production flasks. 
 To ensure that all the inocula were of equal biomass concentrations, a sample was 
spectrophotometrically scanned and an optical density (OD) peak was found at 600nm; a 
comparison of the three was made at this wavelength. Dilutions were made as 
necessary before the inocula were used.  
2.2.5 Biomass determination 
All flask experiments were conducted in 250mL Ehrlenmeyer flasks containing 45mL 
autoclaved growth medium, inoculated with 5m L of the pre-inoculum mixture. All the 
flasks were then incubated at 28°C in the dark. After growth, contents of the flasks were filtered through pre-dried and weighed Whatman #1 filter paper using a vacuum pump. 
The filter papers containing biomass were dried for 24h at 50°C and then re-weighed to give the dry mass. 
 
2.2.6 Comparison of growth media 
Media were compared in terms of biomass yield (Y
x/s), product yield (Y p/s), specific yield 
(Yp/x) and specific growth rate ( ). No appropriate term was found in literature that 
correlated the productivity of a micororganism with growth and to this end we defined the 
lump parameter ‘growth relat ed productivity (GRP) where:  
 
GRP  = (Y P/X)()  
  
 
with units: U/g/d 
 and   X = biomass

 S = substrate (glucose) 
 units of laccase (U)  .        1 
biomass (g)                    time (d)  
  
282.2.7 Determination of laccase enzyme activity 
Laccase activities were determined by monitoring the oxidation of 2,2’-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate (Wolfenden and Willson, 
1982). The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, 0.33 mL 5 mM ABTS and 0.17 mL sample (Roy-Arcand et al. , 1991). Oxidation of ABTS was 
measured by determining the increase in absorbance of the mixture 420 nm (  = 36 000 
M
-1). One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to 
oxidise 1 mol of ABTS per min. During the testing of this assay for use in this study, 3 
samples were run 10 times each to determine the error associated with this technique. A variance of less than 5 % was found and in light of the high degree of confidence 
associated with this assay, all subsequent samples were done in duplicate.  2.3 Results 
 2.3.1 Comparison of media In initial efforts to grow T. versicolor  in flask culture for laccase production,  difficulties 
were encountered in culturing T. versicolor  in the Kirk medium (Kirk and Tien, 1988), the 
recommended standard for culture of WRF. A survey of literature resulted in three alternative media being selected, namely those of:  Kirk, Yoshitake (Kondo et al., 1994) 
and the TDM developed by Addleman and Archibald (1993). The samples grown in TDM were the first to form a mycelial mat and reached an average total mass of 1.94 g/L after 
11 days growth (Fig. 2.1). This medium was used in all subsequent experiments. Initial 
growth, in terms of biomass accumulation, was faster in the other two media tested but they did not progress to forming the mycelial mat at the fluid/air interface that produces 
high biomass yields. These mat structures are a result of the morphological nature of 
filamentous fungi; they are highly prone to branching and hyphal extension. In the case 
of glucose limitation, as would have occurred by day 9 (Fig 2.2), the formation of polysaccharides around the mycelia is enhanced, which favours the linking of pellets into 
conglomerates (Moreira et al., 1998). Static flasks were preferred because shake flask 
techniques cannot be directly applied to WRF due to their sensitivity to mechanical shear 
and preference for high ratio of surface area to liquid volume (Alleman et al. , 1995).

30To verify the above results, the experiment was repeated with TDM, maintaining growth 
and activity over a long period. In comparison the growth and enzyme production profiles 
follow very similar trends. The growth reached a maximum of 1.82 g/L and enzyme 
activity was found to be 1.38 U/mL (Fig 2.3). The large increase in enzyme activity was observed to occur at the same time as the formation of the continuous pellicle, or 
mycelial mat, which could be evidence of a relationship between growth phase and enzyme production.

2.3.2 Further development of TDM 
On the basis of these preliminary results, TDM was used as the starting point for 
investigating the development of a growth medium suitable for the local strain of T. 
versicolor . The first parameters to be established were the carbon (glucose) and nitrogen 
(peptone) requirements of the fungal strain used here. These were investigated by varying the growth medium concentrations between 20 g/L and 2 g/L the two extreme 
values encountered in the literature. An intermediate third option, 10 g/L, was termed 
‘sufficient’. As would be expected, the cultures with the highest concentration of readily available glucose grew fastest and achieved  the highest biomass accumulation. The 
medium containing 20 g/L of glucose produced 11.6 g/L of dry mycelial mass after 7 d (Fig 2.4). However, in terms of enzyme activity and biomass accumulation, the nitrogen- and glucose-sufficient cultures were the most productive (Table 2.1). This finding is in agreement with those of Kaal et al.  (1995) who demonstrated that among five common  
  
31white-rot fungi that they tested (T. versicolor  not included), higher biomass and lignolytic 
enzyme activities were observed in response to N (organic)-sufficient conditions. The 
only exception to this trend was LiP production in P. chrysosporium . This is notable 
because P. chrysosporium  is the most commonly studied WRF and many researchers 
have assumed the nutrient limitation model true for all WRF; and is contrasted by the work on T. versicolor undertaken in this study.

Alleman (1991) showed that fungal biomass production in flask cultures is slower in 
nitrogen-deficient cultures and that their long-term viability is reduced compared to 
nitrogen-sufficient ones. Collins and Dobson (1995) also investigated a T. versicolor  
strain, which reached maximal LiP activity when cultured under carbon-rich 
conditions (10 g/l glucose), and a similar increase in MnP was recorded. This 
increase in enzyme activity at elevated carbon levels appeared to be mediated at  
  
33transcriptional level, given that both lip and mnp  mRNA transcript levels mirrored the 
observed enzyme activities. More recently Collins and Dobson (1997) demonstrated 
that nitrogen-induced laccase production in T. versicolor  was induced at the level of 
transcription. When nitrogen was provided to the fungus at increasing concentrations, a corresponding increases in lcc mRNA was observed. Hence, it seems that nitrogen 
was an important factor in regulating the expression of the three major lignolytic 
enzymes in white rot fungi.  In the flask culture investigation, the glucose 
concentration in all the flasks was reduced to almost zero by day 12 (Fig. 2.5). This 
coincided with the maximal enzyme production for media A and E, and at least 80% of maximum for the other media. The culture in medium C displayed the highest enzyme productivity in terms of initial nitrogen and carbon provided (product yield = 0.35 U/g), but because of the limited availability of these nutrients, this medium did 
not produce a large amount of biomass, and hence, a lower total amount of enzyme 
was produced (Fig 2.4). In any large-scale application, production of high yields of enzyme and biomass, for less operating expenditure, would obviously be beneficial.

g/L C: 20 g/L N (D) and 10 g/L C: 10 g/L N (E). Biomass yield Y x/s (grams of biomass 
produced per gram of glucose) but not overall biomass accumulation, was highest in 
medium D (0.125 g/g). This value may be slightly inflated as the complex nitrogen source (peptone) provided supplementation to the low initial concentration of glucose. This may not have been the case if an inorganic nitrogen source such as ammonium had been used. Product yield Y
p/s (units of laccase produced per gram of 
glucose) was highest for medium C (0.35 U/g), and the overall amount of enzyme produced was far higher in E (1.2 U/mL) compared to 0.67 U/mL for C  (Fig 2.4).  
  
34Specific yield Y p/x (units of laccase produced per gram of biomass) was highest in 
media C (6.96 U/g) and E (4.78 U/g). Obviously, because there was so little growth in 
C (0.74 g/L) the small amount of enzyme that was produced resulted in a high 
specific yield, but this is of limited value in process terms. Medium E, on the other 
hand, produced both significant growth (3.7 g/L) and a large amount of enzyme. As 
expected, the specific growth rate ( ) was highest in the cultures with highest initial 
carbon concentrations: A, B, and E. Considering the results from the growth 
indicators monitored (Table 2.1), nutrient regime E (10 g/L glucose and peptone) was found to be the best of the five.

The Growth Related Productivity (the product of specific yields and ) was 3.75 times 
higher in medium E than the next best medium formulation, A. The term GRP was 
defined because it was necessary to relate laccase production with growth. Specific yield does not give an idea of growth rate or total biomass accumulation and it is then difficult to predict total enzyme produced in a fermentation. GRP provides an 
indication of overall or total enzyme yield, for example: medium C had a very high 
specific yield (6.96 U/g) but this is misleading because there was limited fungal growth and low total laccase production. On the basis of its enzyme production and cost benefits medium E was used in all further experiments.  
2.3.3 Growth and enzyme activity of T. pubescens  
An alternative strain of Trametes , Trametes pubescens  was obtained from the Boku 
Institute in Austria, where it had been recently been identified as an excellent 
producer of laccase (Galhaup et al., 2002). This characterisation work had utilised an 
extremely rich and complex growth medium containing up to 40 g/L glucose. In the present study, T. pubescens was grown up in flasks to test the efficiency of the 
medium E developed previously, for growth and enzyme production T. versicolor,   
  
35compared with the medium recommended by the suppliers of the T. pubescens  
culture. 
 
The T. pubescens  cultures grown in the recommended, glucose rich, medium 
produced more than double (7.8 g/L) the biomass of the optimised medium E (3.6 
g/L) after 7 days growth (Fig 2.5). However, laccase production however was almost six times higher in medium E (6.35 U/mL) than in the recommended medium (1.1 
U/mL) and the specific productivity was 12.6 times greater in medium E (Fig. 2.6). 
Thus, for a bioprocess requiring large amounts of biomass to be produced, a carbon enriched growth medium would be preferred. However, in the case of this project however, the goal of increased production of oxidative enzymes would be best served by a carbon and nitrogen sufficient medium. There is also obvious potential 
for a two stage process where rapid initial growth could be supported by high concentrations of readily available carbon and thereafter an 'enzyme production medium' of lower nutrient concentration would be utilised. In this manner it would be possible to ensure both high biomass and high enzyme production. 
 
It was further suggested (Galhaup C, pers comm.) that a 5mM concentration of copper (added as CuSO
4) be used as an inducer of laccase activity and this was also 
tested. The addition of copper resulted in a positive effect on laccase production, increasing it in both media. The effect was greatest in the glucose rich medium where 
activity was increased more than nine fold up to a maximum of 10.2 U/mL, but was 
also evident in the optimised medium with an maximum titre of 10.5 U/mL being achieved (Fig. 2.6). Considering that most laccases contain 4 copper ions that are essential for activity, this finding is not surprising. The regulation of lcc expression by 
copper is analogous to the effect of manganese on MnP gene regulation (Brown et 
al., 1991).

Although copper was certainly found to be an effective inducer of laccase activity, it is 
an anti-microbial agent, and as such, presents a potential environmental hazard, for example, should a crude enzyme slurry be required for an in situ  soil bioremediation 
process. This induction method would therefore not be applicable in a bioremediation process but could still be effective in a laccase production application where the copper could be removed by ion exchange, dialysis or some other established purification method.  
2.3.4 Effect of inducers on growth and enzyme production Laccase expression has been a topic of some research interest and laccases from a 
number of lignolytic fungi, including T. versicolo r, have previously been cloned and 
characterised (Jonsson et al.,  1995). It has been suggested that genes encoding 
various isozymes are differentially expressed, with some being constitutive and 
others being inducible (Bollag and Leonowicz, 1984). In an experiment to test the 
efficacy of four known inducers, it was found that the presence of all the compounds 
did, to some extent, increase laccase enzyme activity in this strain of T. versicolor  
(Fig 2.7). Guaiacol, a lignin monomer, was the most effective, resulting in an increase 
of 780% in enzyme activity. This is not entirely surprising, as it most closely 
resembles the natural substrates of the lignolytic enzyme system and would have been the most easily recognisable to the fungus. The decrease in activity after day 3  
  
37is attributed to the removal/polymerisation of the inducer compounds and the 
subsequent discontinuation their affect. This could be overcome in a process situation by monitoring the laccase activity and adding more of the inducer compound 
as required. This was achieved in an airlift reactor study (Chapters 5 and 6).

Fig 2.7 Effect of different inducers on laccase production in flask cultures of T. 
versicolor  
 
Thurston (1994) suggested that one function of laccases is to detoxify highly reactive 
aromatic compounds by polymerising them. This is further verified by the fact that the 
increase in laccase production coincides in many instances with the formation of dark precipitates that may represent laccase-polymerised forms of the inducer. The induction effect appears to be specific for certain compounds and involve xenobiotic response elements (XRE’s). This receptor or binding protein is a member of a family 
of regulatory proteins that activate gene transcription in the presence of nonpolar 
carbon compounds. The presence of putative XRE sequence 180 bp upstream from 
the TATA box in the lignolytic fungus PM1, a close relative of T. versicolor, and the 
fact that its laccases are also induced by xylidine (Coll, 1993) suggests that the lcc 
genes of T. versicolor  are also activated by certain aromatic compounds. The results 
obtained in this study agree with the available knowledge on the induction effect of aromatic inducers on T. versicolor .  
 
Aromatic inducer compounds are potentially toxic to fungi and, in the case of 2,6- 
xylidine, retard growth at high concentrations (> 2 mM). However, because these inducers were used at low concentrations (1 mM), they had no obvious toxic effect on  
  
38the cultures, as indicated by the similarity of the growth curves of the induced 
cultures to that of the control (Fig 2.8).

Clearly, using inducers would maximise enzyme production in T. versicolor,  but in 
any industrial application, the cost could be prohibitive. An obvious solution would be to identify an inexpensive, readily available source of inducer. Therefore, an experiment was conducted where the induction by two industrial effluents was 
investigated. Guaiacol is a lignin monomer and it was reasonable to assume that an 
E stage kraft effluent from a pulp and paper mill would contain similar compounds. Similarly the stripped gas liquor or cresylic effluent stream from a Fischer-Tropsch (Appendix C) is known to contain phenol, cresol and other potentially useful aromatic monomers (Table 2.2). The effluents were filter sterilised and added to the flasks 
after 7 days growth to final concentrations of 1 and 2%. The presence of both 
concentrations of both effluents resulted in increased laccase production (Fig. 2.9), with 1% pulp-and-paper effluent having the greatest effect, increasing the measured laccase activity by 670%. The cresylic effluent gave a more sustained induction effect 
over 8 days (Fig. 2.9) and on this basis was selected for further research.

2.4 Conclusions 
 A new, efficient and economical medium was developed for culture of the 
white rot fungus T. versicolor . 
o Of the media formulations commonly recommended in literature on 
white rot fungi, and specifically T. versicolor, the ‘Trametes Defined 
Medium’ of Addleman and Archibald (1993) proved initially to be the 
most successful, in terms of growth and laccase production, for the strain used in this study.  
 
 Use of a nutrient-sufficient medium allowed superior growth-related 
productivity: o While a growth medium with an excess of glucose (20 g/l) produced 
the greatest biomass accumulation, the ‘sufficient’ glucose (10 g/L) and peptone (10 g/L) was superior in terms of overall enzyme 
production and ‘Growth Related Productivity’, and will be used in 
future work.  
o This is in agreement with the available literature on certain other 
basidiomycetes (Kaal et al.,  1995).  
  
40 
 This means that T. versicolor has a distinct production advantage in that 
it has the ability to produce high levels of laccase, under nutrient 
sufficient (rapid growth) conditions,  producing large amounts of the 
enzyme. 
  Furthermore, when used in flask culture for culturing of a different strain 
of Trametes,  namely  T. pubescens,  the sufficient medium also gave a 
much higher enzyme titre (9.5 U/mL) after 7 days growth than the recommended medium (1.95 U/mL). 
 
 The T. versicolo r strain used here produced growth-associated 
(constitutive) and inducible laccases.  
o When the medium was supplemented by the addition of an aromatic-
containing effluent, a large increase in the production of laccase was observed, with a maximum activity of 1.5 U/mL (cresylic effluent) 
achieved.  
 
 This is one of the highest enzyme activities reported for flask cultures of 
T. versicolor (Table 2.3).  
  The common monophenol, guaiacol, proved to be the most effective of 
the commercially available inducers, producing an increase in laccase 
production of nearly 800%, without noticeably affecting biomass accumulation.  
 The results presented in this chapter represent a sound basis from which to further 
investigate and optimise biomass generation and laccase production in Trametes  
species.

42CHAPTER 3 : DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE METHODOLOGIES FOR 
TRAMETES  SPECIES (Part 2):  FACTOR S INFLUENCING GROWTH AND 
LACCASE PRODUCTION IN FLASK CULTURE 
 
3.1 Introduction 
Although there has been much research focused on the mechanisms of enzymic 
degradation of lignolytic compounds and physiological control of enzyme secretion, 
relatively little is understood regarding the physiological adaptation of T. versicolor to 
an environmental challenge. A better understanding of this response would better enable the exploitation of the potential of T. versicolor’s  for biodegradation. Fungi 
exhibit considerable developmental plasticity, being able to switch between a variety 
of distinct “functional modes”, or programmed morphogenetic cycles, which confer versatility on the fungus, allowing it to adapt to differing environmental conditions (White and Boddy, 1992). There is some evidence of differences in extracellular 
enzyme production between modes. For instance, the basidiomycete Hymenochaete 
corrugata has two different colony morphs: a woolly, white form with extensive aerial 
mycelia, and an appressed pigmented form associated with increased laccase and tyrosinase activity, occurring in more extensively decayed wood (Sharland et al., 
1986). Similarly, Rigidoporus microporus produces one mycelial form which is 
tolerant of poor aeration, produces laccase, and may be responsible for development 
within wood, and a second form which produces mycelial cords responsible for superficial ectotrophic spread, but which does not produce laccase (White & Boddy, 1992). 
 
A large variety of chemical products are newly synthesized and produced commercially every year. During their manufacture and use, these chemicals are 
often discharged into the environment. T. versicolor  has potential for the 
mineralisation of one such group of compounds, phenols. The physiological response 
of T. versicolor to the presence of a phenolic effluent, generated by a fuel-from-coal 
plant, was investigated in this study. This effluent arises from the Fischer-Tropsch process, the greatest portion of which is known as Stripped Gas Liquour (SGL) and is 
produced from the plant of origin in volumes of up to 62  10
6 L/d. The SGL stream 
originates from gasification condensate and contains pitch, tar and naphtha as well 
as phenols and creosotes (Philips and du Toit, 2003). Most of these compounds are 
removed by physical processes, gravity separation and liquid-liquid extraction, but 
the resulting stream still contains xenobiotic compounds (Table 3.1).

It is generally accepted, that in the degradation of aromatic compounds by WRF, the 
initial attack on aromatic pollutants is made by the extracellular lignolytic enzymes 
(Hammel, 1995). These enzymes perform a one-electron oxidation, thereby generating cation radicals of the pollutant compounds. The radicals then undergo spontaneous chemical reactions such as C-C cleavage or hydroxylation resulting in more hydrophilic products that taken up by the fungal cells and co-metabolised in the 
presence of the proper carbon source (cellulose) to carbon dioxide (Hammel and 
Moen, 1991). This is a complex process of oxidation, reduction, methylation and hydroxylation. Despite much research on the oxidative mechanism of the lignolytic enzymes, the mechanism of lignin degradation and oxidation of lignin-related 
compounds are not entirely understood. The reactions are complicated and involve 
numerous low molecular weight compounds that may serve as redox mediators.   The objective of the work discussed in this chapter was to elucidate the response of 
cultures of T. versicolor exposed to increasing concentrations of the effluent. This 
response was measured with respect to changes in morphology, enzyme production 
and metabolic activity. The morphology was assessed qualitatively by visual inspection, and then more closely by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The ability of the different colony morphs to remove target effluent monomers from 
solution was determined by HPLC. Metabolic activity was determined by the 
measurement of rate of the hydrolysis of 3, 6- diacetylfluorescein (FDA) (Schnurer and Rosswall, 1982). FDA is hydrolysed by a number of different enzymes, such as proteases, lipases and esterases, and thus its hydrolysis is correlated with levels of general microbial activity. The product of the enzymatic conversion is flourescein, 
which can be quantified by spectrophotometry. This method fulfils the requirement 
that any technique utilised to measure total microbial activity should be non-specific and sensitive, and any incubation period necessary should be as short as possible. FDA has been used previously to determine quantities of active fungi and bacteria in 
soil (Schnurer & Rosswall, 1982).   
  
44The most common spectrophotometric tests performed to measure laccase activity 
utilise the phenolic substrates: guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (Prillinger and Esser, 1975) and syringaldizine. Another, more recently employed, substrate is the electron- 
rich 2,2- azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). The oxidation 
of ABTS by laccase produces the readily measurable, stable, dark green cation 
radical ABTS
+ (Bourbonnaise and Paice, 1990). Furthermore, ABTS can act as a 
redox mediator for the indirect oxidation of non-substrate lignin compounds with high 
redox potentials (Xu et al . 2000). 
 
In this study, it was observed during the ABTS laccase assay of samples containing 
high concentrations of phenols, that the measured laccase activities were 
consistently lower than expected. Low enzyme activities were obtained at high phenolic concentrations, even though the removal of these phenols increased with concentration. The results from the ABTS colorimetric assay was then compared to the results of a equivalent assay based on oxygen consumption, to determine 
whether or not the laccase activity was in fact decreasing or whether the assay was 
being interfered with by the residual phenols. Such an effect would result in an underestimation of actual laccase activities in the experimental samples, and hence would indicate that the culture system was less effective than was actually the case. 
 3.2 Methods 
 
3.2.1 Strain preservation 
A culture of T. versicolor (PPRI #3845 was maintained as in section 2.2.1.  
 
3.2.2 Liquid Culture 
Trametes defined medium (TDM) (Addleman and Archibald 1993) was used initially 
as the medium for the production of biomass and enzyme, but the glutamine was 
replaced by peptone, and dimethyl succinate, sodium and calcium chloride were 
omitted. The previously selected medium with glucose and peptone concentrations of 
10 g/L was used.   
3.2.3 Inoculation 
Flasks were inoculated as described in section 2.2.4. 
 3.2.4 Biomass determination 
Fungal biomass was determined as in section 2.2.5.  
  
453.2.5 Laccase preparation for inhibition study 
T. pubescens  was cultured in a 4 L (3.5 L working volume) airlift reactor with an 
aspect ratio of 4.7:1. The modified Trametes Defined Medium (Addleman and 
Archibald, 1993) was used and air was supplied at 3L/min. After a 120 h fermentation 
the culture fluid was removed, centrifuged to remove cells and then freeze dried to give the crude enzyme extract. A portion of the crude extract was purified by acetone 
precipitation (1:1 vol/vol). The samples comprised of 50 L enzyme (20 g/mL) and 
50 L dissociation buffer. They were heated in boiling water for 5 min and then 
cooled to room temperature. The gel was run at 120 V for 3 hours. 
 
3.2.6 Measurement of Laccase enzyme activity 
a) ABTS   
Laccase activity determined by the oxidation of ABTS was carried out as 
described in section 2.2.7 
 
b) Oxygen Utilisation Rate (OUR)  
OUR assays were carried in a sealed 100 mL flask containing at 10x the volume of the reactants. The oxygen consumption was measured with a dissolved oxygen probe (YSI 5740) linked to a HiTech Microsystems 
DO/OUR meter. The meter was activated on addition of the enzyme 
sample; the first 10 seconds of the run were disregarded to allow for a delay in probe response time. 
 
3.2.7 Measurement of total microbial activity 
Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (Sigma) was dissolved in analytical grade acetone and stored as a stock solution (2 mg/mL) at –20 °C. The amount of FDA hydrolysed was 
measured as absorbance increase at 490 nm ( A
490). Biomass samples were obtained 
on filter paper discs as described previously (section 2.2.5), but were not dried. 
These were simultaneously added with FDA (final concentration, 10 µg/mL) to sterile 
50 mL sodium phosphate buffer (60 mM, pH 7.6) and the mixture was incubated at 24 °C on a rotary shaker. Experiments were run over 3h with readings taken every 30 min to determine the FDA hydrolysis curves The buffering capacity was sufficient to maintain the pH at 7.6 for the duration of the experiments (Schnurer & Rosswell, 
1982). 1.5 mL samples were drawn from each flask and centrifuged for 4 min at 5000 
rpm to remove any debris. A
490 values of the supernatant of these samples were 
determined and each determination was carried out in triplicate.  .   
  
46 
3.2.8 Effect of phenolic effluent on physiology and enzyme production 
Flask cultures were allowed to grow until a continuous pellicle, or mycelial mat, 
formed at the air-liquid interface. This occurred after 9 d growth. Varying amounts of 
effluent (2.5 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % vol/vol) were then added to the liquid medium in each flask. Samples (1 mL) were aseptically drawn from each flask every day for 4 d and then again after 12 d. Biomass (section 2.2.5) and microbial activities (section 
3.2.7) were determined as before and morphology was observed in terms of colour 
and consistency of both the fungal mat and growth medium. A laccase activity assay (section 2.2.7) was performed on each sample.  
3.2.9 Effect of culture age prior to cresylic effluent addition on growth and   enzyme production 
The target effluent used in this study was obtained from the cresylic stream of a local 
coal gasification plant. The effluent contained negligible amounts of settled solids and high concentrations of phenol and the isomers of cresol (Table 3.1). A number of 
flasks were inoculated as before (section 3.1.3) and left to grow for 4 d. The cresylic 
effluent obtained from the coal gasification plant was then added at 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations (v/v) to a set of flasks. Daily samples were aseptically drawn from the flasks, centrifuged and then filtered to remove any cell debris, assayed for laccase activity, and the remainder frozen for further analysis. After 4 d the flasks 
were removed from the incubator, the biomass filtered off, dried and weighed. At this 
time effluent was added to a second set of original flasks in identical concentrations and the process repeated, and similarly for a third set, after a further 4 d. This resulted in the effluent being added to cultures of different ages: 4 d (set 1), 8 d (set 
2), and 12 d (set 3) and in different stages of growth. 
 
3.2.10 HPLC analysis 
Samples were aseptically drawn from the flasks, centrifuged and then filtered to 
remove any cell debris. The removal of the effluent components was monitored by 
HPLC (Merck LaChrom), utilising a Waters S5 (5  m), C
18 reverse phase column 
(250 x 4.6mm) with a mobile phase of water:acetonitrile 85:15 containing 1.66% w/v 
-cyclodextrin, to separate the cresol isomers. 
  
  
473.2.11 Electron Microscopy 
The mycelial mats were removed from the stationary flask cultures and 5 mm x 5 mm 
sections taken from them and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde. These were taken through 
a critical point drying series to remove any moisture that would interfere with the 
sputter coating method (Cross, 1987). The sample was placed in the sputter coater holder, clamped in position and the chamber closed. The chamber was evacuated until a vacuum of 10
-1 Torr had been achieved. The vacuum level was then balanced 
at 5 x10-1 Torr. Argon was used to flush out the residual air in this manner for 5 to 10 
min. The argon leak valve was then closed and the chamber further evacuated. When a vacuum of better than 5x10
-1 Torr had been achieved, the sputtering current 
was allowed to rise to 15 mA. The timer was set to 90 s and sputtering allowed to proceed. After the coating was complete, air was admitted to the chamber. The 
specimens were then removed from the holder and examined using a JEOL JSM- 
840 Scanning Electron Microscope (Cross, 1987).  Photomiocrographs are shown on page 53.   
3.3 Results 
 
3.3.1 Enzyme production in flasks  
A single activity band, that correlated well with commercial laccase (Sigma Aldrich) 
was obtained for the purified enzyme samples on an SDS PAGE gel activity stained with ABTS solution (Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.2). Protein concentration was determined 
according to Bradford (1976).

3.3.2 Morphological effects of phenolic effluent addition on biomass of 
T. versicolor  
Browning of fungal tissues often results from enzymic oxidation of phenolic 
substrates by phenoloxidases and peroxidases (White and Boddy, 1992). In this 
study, this occurred when cresylic effluent was added to flasks cultures of T. 
versicolor.  As soon as the cultures showed visible mycelial mats growing on the 
surfaces of the growth medium (7 days), varying concentrations of cresylic effluent 
were added to the flasks. It was evident that high effluent concentrations had a 
significant physiological effect on T. versicolor,  as demonstrated by a decrease in 
biomass accumulation (measured as dry mass) in the presence of the phenols (Table 
3.3). This effect became more pronounced with increasing effluent concentration and was accompanied by marked changes in the morphology and appearance of the biomass and culture medium (Table 3.3).

Fungal hyphae self-organise into an interconnected, branching mycelium and 
colonies grow by repeated branching of the hyphal tips to form a ramified mycelial 
network. Jones et al.  (1996) used image analysis software to quantify the global 
fractal dimension, which provideded an index of fungal branching morphology. The  
  
49global fractal dimension is an overall estimate of scaling complexity.  It was shown 
that whole colonies of the WRF Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  display a similar mode of 
branching initiation that can be indexed by using fractal geometry. A correlation was 
established between hyphal branching, and the number density of active tip 
production per unit area, and extracellular oxidase expression levels. Furthermore, mycelial morphology and protein expression were found to be influenced by medium composition i.e. enzymatic function was linked to colony structure (Jones and Lonergan, 1997). P. cinnabarinus was grown on solid growth medium (agar) 
supplemented with a known paramorphogen, cellobiose. A paramorphogen is thought to stimulate or induce changes in fungal cell physiology by altering either the cell wall biochemistry, by affecting the cytosol molar ratios of transport proteins that are involved with protein synthesis, or the cell-mycelium morphology by enhancing or 
repressing hyphal branching. The cellobiose caused profuse hyphal branching 
(higher fractal dimension) and a reduction in radial expansion. These changes in morphology were accompanied by a concomitant exponential increase in the expression of laccase into the extracellular medium in liquid culture.  Hypersecretion 
was stimulated approximately 7070% over the control at 5 days. This study 
demonstrated a strong correlation between spatial pattern phenomena (morphology) 
and physiological function . 
 
An obvious correlation exists between the effects of the paramorphogen (cellobiose) 
used by Jones and Lonergan (1997) the phenolic effluent used in this study. Both 
had adverse morphological effects on the fungi in question and both stimulated increases in laccase concentration. Morphogenic self-organisation in fungi has been shown in both cases to be an interconnected dynamic process which links spatial 
structure with biochemical function at the cellular and sub-cellular levels of scale. 
 
3.3.3 Optimisation of enzyme produciton - Effect of time of addition of  
 phenolic effluent on laccase production in T. versicolor 
After several initial attempts, it became readily apparent that adding even small 
concentrations of effluent to flask cultures at the same time as inoculation severely 
inhibited growth of T. versicolor . It became obvious that there would be an optimum 
culture age at which it would be most advantageous to add effluent to the fungal 
cultures. The addition of varied concentrations of phenolic effluent to flask cultures at 
different stages of growth showed that the time of addition played a significant role in 
the resultant effect of that addition (Fig 3.2). At all effluent concentrations, the 12 day-old cultures (Fig 3.2 C) were better able to tolerate the pollutant addition, as indicated  
  
50by their producing more degradative enzymes, up to 3.8 U/mL compared to a 
maximum of 0.65 U/mL for the 4 day-old (Set 1) and 2.9 U/mL for the eight-day old (Set 2) cultures (Figs 3.2 A and 3.2 B). Furthermore, increasing the pollutant 
concentration in Set 3 resulted in increased enzyme production; whereas the 
opposite effect was observed in Set 1 and only low concentrations (1.825 mM) had a 
positive effect on Set 2.  Laccase production by T. versicolor has been shown to 
peak after 12 days in cultures without any inducers added (section 2.3.2). This 
phenomenon occurred 2 to 3 days after glucose depletion and fits the model of 
lignolytic enzyme production as a result of nutrient limitation. The control cultures generated the highest laccase activities after pollutant addition in Set 1, but the lowest in Set 3. The flasks with the highest phenol concentration (14.6 mM) produced the lowest amounts of enzymes in Set 1, but the highest in Set 3. The control 
samples had a maximum laccase activity of 2.45 U/mL while a 14.6 mM addition of 
phenol resulted in an activity of 3.8 U/mL, both in Set 3 (Fig 3.2 C).  Therefore, 
although nutrient limitation does increase laccase production in T. versicolor , it is not 
as an effective inducer as certain aromatic compounds.   
 
The toxic effect of cresols and chlorophenols has been measured by the growth retardation, and the detoxification of these compounds by WRF by the removal of 
toxicity associated inhibition (Bollag et al. 1988). These authors found an increased 
lag phase in fungal growth after pollutant addition and complete inhibition of growth 
at concentrations approaching 2 mM.  It was further reported that it was the laccase 
that was unequivocally responsible for detoxifying p-cresol, o- cresol and 2,6-
dimethylphenol, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the parent phenol. The 
detoxification of these phenols allowed fungal growth to take place. In the present 
study, results from the dry mass determinations (Fig 3.3) indicate clearly that allowing 
more time for growth before adding toxic compounds reduced the negative effects of 
these compounds on the physiological state of the T. versicolor cultures. The cultures 
in Set 1 deteriorated markedly in terms of biomass at pollutant concentrations above 
7mM, while Sets 2 and 3 actually showed increased biomass accumulation. This is 
possibly due to a combination of the fact that the effluent provided an additional 
carbon source and that the older cultures were able to detoxify their environment more quickly by removing the pollutants, and in doing so were better able continue normal growth. The fact that there was no available glucose in the culture fluid when 
the effluent was added to Set 3 and the highest concentrations of effluent supported 
the highest biomass concentrations is further evidence that T. versicolor  must have 
used the phenols provided as an additional carbon source. Although this argument  
  
51contradicts previous research (Bollag et al., 1988, Hammel et al., 1995) it is difficult 
to draw another conclusion from these results.

Phenol is not readily biodegradable and has been reported to be toxic or growth inhibitory to most types of micoroorganisms, even to those species that have the 
metabolic capacity of using it as a growth substrate (Annachatre and Gheewala, 
1996). The ability of T. versicolor  to grow in the presence of up to nearly 15 mM 
phenol is further evidence of its bioremediation potential. T. versicolor  has been 
shown to be resilient to other frequently encountered environmental pollutants. 
Alleman et al.  (1992) found that T. versicolor  was able to more effectively 
dehalogenate PCP than the six other WRF tested by them and as a result was the 
also grew the fastest. Morgan et al.  (1991) found that T. versicolor was best able to 
mineralise dichloroaniline, dieldrin and phenanthrene out of four WRF tested, including P. chrysosporium .  
 
This work highlighted the importance of allowing cultures sufficient growth time to develop the systems necessary for dealing with environmental challenges before exposing them to these pollutants. This result is important in light of the fact that it has been reported previously that the addition only 2 mM o- and p-  cresol to the 
culture medium prior to inoculation inhibited the growth of another well-studied 
laccase producing WRF Rhizoctonia praticola  (Bollag et al., 1988) 
 A closer examination (by SEM) of the morphology of T. versicolor indicated that 
fungal biomass exposed to high concentrations (14mM) of phenols had a thin, 
random, highly branched structure (Fig 3.4 B, D). This contrasts with the thicker walled, linearised, skeletal hyphae usually associated with generative growth that  
  
53characterized the biomass morphology in the flasks containing lower effluent 
concentrations (Fig 3.4 A, C). These differences in morphology are partly explained by the fact that; individual fungal mycelia are indeterminate structures and mycelial 
organisation is directed by interactions between the genotype of a particular 
organism, and the prevailing abiotic (microclimate) and biotic (other organisms) environments, mediated at the boundaries of colonies as a whole and individual hyphal tubes. Heterogeneous microclimate and resource quality have been shown previously to have a substantial influence on mycelial growth (White et al., 1998). 
The phenolic compounds in the culture fluid had a visible effect on the biomass of T. 
versicolor (Table 3.3) and an ultrastructural one (Fig 3.4). The effect of 
paramorphogens (compounds that induce changes in cellular physiology) such as 
phenol on T. versicolor is discussed further in later sections. Furthermore, the 
reaction of laccase with phenolic compounds produces reactive quinone compounds 
that may be involved in oxidative polymerisations with cell surface components such as carbohydrates or proteins, resulting in a change of hydrophobicity of the hyphal walls. These reactions might serve to chemically cross-link adjacent hyphae leading to the construction of aggregated tissue (Score et al., 1996). This effect can be seen 
in the high-density morphology of the biomass exposed to phenol (Fig 3.4 B, D).

3.3.4 Changes in microbial activity of T. versicolor  cultures exposed to 
phenolic compounds 
The comparative microbial activity of the cultures exposed to different effluent 
concentrations was investigated by the spectrophotometric determination of the hydrolysis of flourescein diacetate (FDA) to flourescein. FDA as a substrate for 
determining the overall activity of decompos er organisms is useful because it is 
hydrolysed by a number of different enzymes and a good correlation between FDA 
hydrolysis and respiration has been found (Schnurer and Roswall, 1982). Total  
  
55microbial activity in the control culture of T. versicolor showed a typical saturation 
curve, with an initial linear increase in absorbance at 490 nm up to 30 min (0.563) 
and thereafter the rate of absorbance decreased over time to reach 1.02 after 180 
min (Fig. 3.5). The differences between the samples for the total absorbance values 
obtained at t = 30 min were found to be approximately the same as those obtained after 3 hours of incubation. For consistency therefore, when comparing the microbial activities of different samples, the initial rates were used. The decrease in hydrolysis 
rate over time is probably due to complete substrate utilisation limitation, as FDA has 
been shown to be non-toxic to microorganisms and mammalian cells at the concentrations used in this assay (Schnurer and Roswall, 1982). This concentration limitation cannot be remedied, however, as FDA solutions become cloudy at higher concentrations, reducing reproducibility.

metabolic activity of T. versicolor   
 
The total microbial activity of T. versicolor cultures in the absence of a pollutant 
challenge was correlated with the amount of biomass accumulated during the 
exponential growth phase of the fungus and a linear relationship (R2 = 0.99) was 
found. This is not entirely surprising, as one would expect almost the entire culture to be uniformly active during this period.  Schnurer and Roswall (1984) also found a linear relationship between FDA hydrolysis and different amounts of microbial biomass in a suspended soil sample but warned against using this assay as a 
biomass determination, and recommend it as a measure of microbial activity only. In 
this study it has been used as such, but the linearity of the relationship between biomass and FDA hydrolysis demonstrated (Fig. 3.6) indicates the potential to extend the use of this assay to estimations of biomass within certain constraints e.g. for a synchronously active culture.

3.3.5 Effects of effluent addit ion on metabolic activity of T. versicolor 
It has been already been shown that the addition of a phenolic effluent had profound 
morphological effects on T. versicolor. One would also expect changes to occur in 
the physiology of the fungus as its metabolism shifts to overcome an environmental 
challenge by producing oxidative enzymes. The proportion of metabolically active biomass measured as a ratio of activity (FDA hydrolysis) to biomass was measured 
for cultures of different ages, as done before for laccase activity. This ratio was highest in Set 1 (4 day-old cultures) at low phenol concentrations (3.1 at 1.87 mM) but decreased to less than half at phenol concentrations above 7 mM (Fig 3.7). Since increasing the concentrations of phenol in the medium also decreased the biomass 
of the exposed Set 1 cultures, the decrease in activity is even more marked. Clearly 
cultures at this early stage of development are not able to survive the adverse conditions resulting from high phenolic concentrations. This is not simply a function of less biomass in the younger cultures resulting in an increased chemical dose effect because the activity was measured as a function of total biomass.  
 
The 8 day-old cultures of Set 2 maintained the level of activity of their zero effluent control and had the highest ratio of metabolic activity to biomass across the concentration range tested (Fig 3.7). This could be attributed to the fact that, even 
though they were approaching stationary phase, they would still have been producing 
some of the enzymes required for trophophasic growth and that they were able to  
  
57produce enough laccase to remove the phenols added to their environment and thus 
avert any negative effects they might have. The Set 3 cultures also showed a slight increase in activity at low concentrations (up to 3.65 mM) but activity decreased 
when the biomass was exposed to increased amounts of phenolic compounds (Fig 
3.7). After 12 days of growth before the effluent addition, these cultures had entered idiophasic growth and one would expect thei r general metabolism to have decreased. 
Laccase production was highest in these cultures (Fig 3.2), a consequence of both 
the glucose limitation and the induction effect of the added phenols.  
 The detoxifying effect of this increased laccase activity enabled these cultures to better tolerate the addition of the effluent; illustrated by the fact that they were able to begin another period of growth, sustained possibly by the phenolic carbon being 
made bio-available. This speculation is supported by the greatest increase in 
biomass observed for the cultures that had the most effluent added to them. Again it has been made clear that time of addition was critical in the bioremediation of a phenolic effluent, (and possibly therefore any potentially toxic substance). At least 8 days growth (flask culture) is required before addition of phenols to cultures of T. 
versicolor in order to best utilise the potential of this organism.

583.3.6 Inhibition of the ABTS laccase assay 
The activity of laccases in vivo  or as purified iso-enzymes is often determined by 
spectrophotometric tests using phenolic substrates and by monitoring the coloured 
oxidation products. The most widely used laccase assay in recent literature utilises 
the electron- rich, non- phenolic substrate 2,2 -azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiozoline-6-
suphonic acid) (ABTS), whose oxidation proceeds in one step resulting in a coloured radical cation ABTS
+. This assay is not without its complications however. The 
ABTS+ complex can react with some of the components in a given sample and its 
absorption in solution depends on the amount of remaining, unreacted ABTS, which 
can result in an underestimation of the enzyme activity (Johannes and Majchercyzk, 2000).     During this investigation of the removal of phenolic compounds by T. versicolor  it was 
noticed that as concentrations of effluent phenols were increased, although phenol removal rates (as measured by HPLC) increased, the ABTS assay indicated lower laccase activities. This was unexpected, as the laccase was considered to be 
primarily responsible for the bioconversion of the phenols. Laccase was the only 
oxidative enzyme measured in significant quantity in the whole cell removal 
experiments with T. versicolor and is well known to remove phenols from solution 
(Bollag et al., 1988, Davis and Burns, 1990, Morgan et al ., 1991, Reddy 1995). To 
better quantify this effect and to remove any possible interference from artefacts in 
whole cell culture, partially purified laccase was reacted with ABTS in the presence of 
various concentrations of the effluent phenols. In this simplified system the laccase activity again decreased in the presence of the phenols and this decrease was found to correlate with increasing phenol concentrations (Fig 3.8).

measuring laccase activity are <5 %  
When this data was plotted in a Lineweaver-Burk format, the results showed a 
classic plot for competitive inhibition (Fig 3.9). In our case this meant that the phenolic effluent acted as an inhibitor (I) that bound reversibly to the laccase active 
site preventing the intended substrate, ABTS, (S) from binding. The data was 
obtained by plotting the reaction rates (v) for several concentrations of ABTS [S] at different concentrations of phenolic inhibitor [I], in the form:    1/v = 1/V
max + K M/Vmax[S] (Ferscht, 1997) 
 Calculation gave a K
m of 3.42 (+/- 0.15) mM and a V max of 2.55 (+/- 0.11)) 
mM/mL/min for the uninhibited ABTS reaction and a K I of 1.913 mM for the phenolic 
inhibitor, calculated according to Ferscht (1997). The V max remained unchanged for 
all concentrations of inhibitor (i.e. the double reciprocal plots for all [I] intersect at 1/V
max), which is diagnostic of competitive inhibition. Furthermore, high 
concentrations of substrate (ABTS) gave reaction rates similar to that of the control ([I] = 0), also indicative of competitive inhibition. Ideally, the plots for different [I] 
should have intersected at the Y axis of the graph and the discrepancy is 0.72 mM, 
but, the regressions for the data series plotted had correlation coefficients of at least R
2 = 0.97, and the reaction rates were calculated in duplicate with a variation of less 
than 5%. ABTS has recently been reported to be inhibitory at high concentrations in 
the laccase assay; Maremonti et al. (in preparation) estimated a K i value of 20 mM 
for the inhibition of laccase by ABTS. However, this value is sufficiently high to  
  
60assume that substrate inhibition is negligible at the conditions adopted for the 
laccase assays conducted in this study (0.5 mM ABTS).  The concentration of oxygen, the other substrate participating in this reaction may be considered in excess for the duration of the reaction (Gianfreda et al.  1998)

3.3.7 The Oxygen Utilisation Rate (OUR) Assay for Laccase  
Johannes and Majcherzyk (2000) suggested that while the ABTS assay was one of 
the better tests determining the activity of oxidative enzymes, in the case of laccase the best (but also more laborious) alternative was to perform a direct measurement of the oxygen consumption. In this study the accuracy of using oxygen consumption as a measure of laccase activity was investigated. A near linear relationship (R
2 = 
0.999) between enzyme concentration and activity as measured by ABTS and oxygen utilisation rate was shown (Fig 3.10).  This demonstrated that the colourimetric ABTS assay could be substituted safely with the oxygen consumption assay and it now seemed reasonable to relate laccase activity to oxygen 
consumption. The reactions with laccase and the cresylic effluent in presence and 
absence of ABTS were then repeated, using oxygen consumption as a measure of the rate of reaction. There was only a 7 % increase in OUR between reactions using 5 mM ABTS (the assay concentration used in the colourimetric assay) and 25 mM 
ABTS, indicating no that substrate limitation had occurred previously. It was decided  
  
61that 5mM ABTS could reasonably be used for all further experiments requiring the 
use of the colourimetric assay.

The OUR increased with increasing concentration of cresylic effluent (Fig 3.11), a 
result that supports the hypothesis that the laccase was responsible for the removal 
of the phenols in the effluent. However, when ABTS was added to the reaction, the 
total OUR should have been cumulative due to additional reaction with the ABTS  i.e. the reaction of laccase and the cresylic effluent in the presence of ABTS should have produced an OUR approximately equal to the sum of the reaction without ABTS and the ABTS control. The fact that it was not indicates that it was competing with the 
effluent components for binding sites and confirms the suggestion that it was an 
inhibitor.

Kadhim et al. (1999) investigated the removal of phenolic compounds from water by 
T. versicolor and found that both laccase and Mn-dependent peroxidase were 
inactivated to some degree during the removal reaction. This effect was ascribed to 
the formation of reaction intermediates and was also observed with the laccase from 
the soil fungus Rhizoctonia praticola  used for the removal of substituted phenols. The 
effect in both cases was most pronounced with 2,4,6- trichlorophenol that inactivated 
the laccase by 96%.    To test whether the laccase was being inactivated by the aromatic compounds being 
investigated, 2mM slugs of p-cresol were added to a fixed quantity of enzyme and 
the resultant activity measured by monitoring the OUR.  As is evident from Fig 3.12, increasing the amount of p-cresol in the reaction mixture increased the laccase 
activity, as measured by oxygen consumption. Gianfreda et al.  (1998) speculated 
that the oxidative transformation of certain phenolic compounds resulted in the 
formation polymers in which enzyme molecules were entrapped and progressively 
removed from solution. This situation seemed unlikely in the scenario investigated here, no visible precipitates were observed to form, and laccase activity only increased with increased substrate concentration. It should be noted that Gianfreda 
et al.  (1998) measured laccase activity by the ABTS assay alone, interference of their 
test substrate, 2,4-dichlorophenol, with the assay may have been the cause of the 
decrease in laccase activity observed by them.

Although the ABTS assay for laccase activity is widely used, quick to perform and 
reproducible, it is apparent that a flaw exists in the assay when there are other 
laccase substrates present in the reaction mixture. Tests based on a complex, partially non-enzymic oxidation of phenolic substrates present a series of other 
problems and do not seem to be viable alternatives (Johannes and Majcherzyk, 
2000). For accurate quantification of laccase in a solution containing potential 
laccase substrates, these would either have to be removed prior to performing the ABTS assay, an assay based on oxygen consumption appears to be the most accurate.   
3.3.8 Utilisation of a new strain of Trametes – Trametes pubescens  
While attending the ‘Biotechnology in the Pulp and Paper’ conference in Finland in 
June 2001,  D Ryan was made aware of a new, potentially valuable strain of 
Trametes, Trametes pubescens.  This strain was reported to exhibit laccase 
production far higher than that of the T. versicolor  strain currently used by us in this 
project. After receiving a culture from the ‘Universitat fur Bodenkultur’ in Austria we 
set about determining its usefulness in the context of this project. We grew it in the culture medium recommended to us and compared the growth and productivity with a culture inoculated into the medium developed by us for optimum results using T. 
versicolor (medium E, see above). Copper (added as copper sulphate), at a 
concentration of 2mM, was added as an inducer to both growth media, as suggested 
(Galhaup, C pers. comm., 2001).    
  
64Cultures of T. pubescens  grown in the nutrient rich medium that came suggested for 
use with this strain showed a lag phase of six days before large amounts of laccase 
was secreted into the medium. Medium E induced laccase production almost 
immediately and showed a steady increase in production of up to 10 U; both media 
produced laccase to an enzyme activity to a similar maximum (10 U, Figure 3.13). A further advantage in using medium E, apart from cost, is that more than 90% of the maximum enzyme production can be achieved without copper induction, while an 
absence of copper resulted in an 80% decrease in laccase production in the 
‘Austrian’ medium (Figure 3.13). Copper is toxic in high concentrations and would 
need to be removed from any product/waste stream arising from a process using this fungus.

3.4 Conclusions 
 This study has shown that the response of T. versicolor to an 
environmental challenge is a complex process involving enzyme 
induction and morphological differentiation.  
o The hydrolysis of FDA was shown to provide an appropriate means of 
measurement of total metabolic activity in cultures of this fungus, and this procedure indicated a linear relationship between biomass accumulation and microbial (metabolic) activity during primary growth 
phase. 
o By comparison of the biomass/ microbial activity ratio for cultures 
subjected to increasing cresol concentrations, T. versicolor was shown  
  
65to adapt its morphogenetic cycles to local episodic environmental 
pressures, as reported for other WRF by White and Boddy (1992).  
o This conclusion was validated by visual inspection and further by 
electron microscopy, and confirmed by the ability of the fungus to tolerate and remove the model pollutant from solution, even at high concentrations.  
 
 The physiological response to high concentrations of aromatic 
compounds and their subsequent removal by whole-cell cultures of T. 
versicolor have not been previously reported.   Phenol is not readily 
biodegradable and has been reported to be toxic or growth inhibitory to many micoroorganisms.  
 
 The ability of T. versicolor to grow in the presence of up to nearly 15 mM 
phenol is strong evidence of its bioremediation potential.  
 
 This work has highlighted the importance of allowing cultures sufficient 
growth time to develop the systems necessary for dealing with 
environmental challenges before exposing them to these pollutants.  o Culture age prior to the addition of a pollutant is an important factor in 
the survival of the fungus its production of the enzymes necessary to degrade the pollutant. The importance of this parameter has been previously speculated on, but never investigated nor quantified.  
o Moderate cresol concentrations (up to 15 mM) were found to have a 
stimulatory effect on biomass accumulation and laccase enzyme 
production.  
o The physical adaptation to a pollutant challenge demonstrated here, 
indicates the need for consideration of metabolic differentiation in the 
design of a bioreactor for the fungal bioremediation of cresylic 
pollutants.  
 
 The detoxifying effect of increased laccase activity enabled the cultures 
to better tolerate the addition of effluent. This is suggested to be due their 
abilty to begin a further period of growth, sustained by the phenolic carbon being made bio-available. This is supported by the greatest  
  
66increase in biomass being observed for the cultures where the most 
effluent was added. 
 
 While the ABTS colorimetric assay is one of the most popular ways to 
measure the activity of oxidative enzymes, specifically laccase, this study 
has shown that for the assaying of samples containing phenolic 
compounds, this method may not be suitable. Similar problems could well 
be encountered when using other common laccase assay substrates eg syringaldizine. To obtain a more accurate measurement of laccase activity, the competing phenols would need to be removed, or the assay 
should be based on oxygen consumption.   
  
67CHAPTER 4 : DEVELOPMENT OF BIOREACTOR SYSTEMS (PART 1): 
IMMOBILISED BIOFILM REACTORS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF T. VERSICOLOR  
 
4.1 Introduction 
The immobilisation of microbial cells is increasingly being applied in biotechnological 
processes (Vilchez, 1997) and has been found to prolong the retention time of 
microbial cells or enzymes indefinitely without washout, even at high dilution rate.  
The application of enzyme immobilisation technology to treatment of wastewater and drinking water was first considered in the early 1980s (Wenhua, 1993). Ideally a bioreactor must maintain a sterile culture of cells in medium conditions that maximize cell growth and productivity.  A number of complex interactions (physical, chemical 
and biochemical) exist in a bioreactor.  These include:   
i) Mixing and aeration. 
ii) Oxygen demand and supply. 
iii) Cell growth and product formation kinetics in relation to the nutritional 
requirements of the cells. 
iv) Waste and toxic factor accumulation.  
v) Detrimental effects to the culture due to mixing or aeration devices 
This chapter reports the development and use of a membrane bioreactor and a 
trickle bed bioreactor as supports for immobilised cultures of T. versicolor  to facilitate 
the growth of the fungus, laccase production and effluent bioremediation.  
 4.1.1 Transverse flow hollow fibre bioreactor (TFHFBR) 
Previous studies by Burton et al., (1996) and Leukes et al. (1995) have shown that 
the white-rot fungus Phanorochaete chrysosporium  immobilised on capillary 
membranes achieves a steady state of growth after a certain period of time.  This 
concept has been termed the membrane-gradostat concept and is illustrated in Fig 
4.1.  Fungi immobilised in this manner reach a steady state and may be manipulated, either for the continuous production of secondary metabolites, or possibly for bioremediation purposes. The rationale behind the gradostat concept is that 
depletion of nutrients from the growth medium as it perfuses across the membrane 
into the biofilm creates a radial nutrient gradient. This means that the biomass closest to the lumen of the hollow fibre membrane is in contact with a nutrient rich environment, while biomass that is radially distant from the lumen is nutrient limited;  
  
68there is a concurrent oxygen gradient decreasing towards the lumen. This induces a 
switch to stationary growth and secondary metabolism with the accompanying increase in enzyme production. This biomass eventually dies and is sloughed off the 
outside of the biofilm by an air stream. The continuous formation of new biomass at 
the edge of the lumen and the continuous enzyme production and sloughing off on the outside, lead to a stable, steady state equilibrium. Essentially this concept converts the normally temporal events of a typical growth curve in batch culture into 
spatial events resulting in continuous production of enzyme over time. This concept 
was applied, in this study, to determine the suitability of a gradostat reactor for 
T. versicolor -mediated bioremediation. 
 
 
Fig 4.1 The gradostat concept developed for continuous production of 
secondary metabolites from white rot fungi. Nutrient gradients are established 
over space instead of time as in the case in batch culture. Exponential growth 
(I), stationary (II) and decline (III) phases are the same as for batch cultures except that these phases occur over space instead of time so that part of the culture is continuously in secondary metabolic phase. There is no lag phase. 
 
4.1.2 Trickle Bed Bioreactor (TBR) 
TBRs consist of a porous bed of an organic or inert synthetic material that supports a biofilm. A liquid nutrient scheme is introduced into the bed via a nozzle at the top of the reactor and flows downward over the biocatalyst (immobilised fungus) surface as a film within a gas continuum. In the configuration used in this study, humidified air 
was pumped from the bottom of the reactor, counter current to liquid whereas 
traditionally it is introduced co-currently. This system is advantageous in that it can be packed into tall towers, which gives it plug-flow characteristics unless, of course, a Air IIIII
Wall Lumen 
  
69recycle is introduced. TBR’s are inherently continuous in operation and are used 
mainly in the petrochemical industry for hydrogenation-based reactions and in bioremediation for gas stripping.  Although these reactors generally have low 
operating costs, they can become gas-liquid mass transfer-limited at high flow rates 
(Stitt, 2002).  There has been a previous attempt to produce lignolytic enzymes in a TBR. Ruggeri and Sassi (2003) reported on the growth of and LiP production by P. chrysosporium  
in a 500cm
3 TBR with an aspect (H/D) ratio of 17. These authors found that the 
superficial velocity of the feed gas controlled the oxygen mass transfer to biomass, but also that the liquid flow regime played an important part in the oxygen supply pathways. A more direct contact between gas and biotic phase increased reactor 
productivity. The use of an alternating continuous/pulsed flow regime was used to 
achieve this to an extent. Pulsed flow increased the variability of the liquid film thickness and hence the portion of biomass directly exposed to the gaseous phase. Ruggeri and Sassi (2003) reported further on the advantages of the system in terms 
of ease of product separation.   In order to  evaluate support matrices for potential use 
in an Airlift Loop Reactor (ALR), and also as an alternative reactor system, a trickle 
filter reactor was developed for the growth of T. versicolor. The supports tested in this 
study included Oasis® florists’ material, silicate pebbles used in hydroponic growth 
systems and woven glass beads (Dennert Poravar GmbH).  
 4.2 Metods 
 
4.2.1 Transverse flow hollow fibre bioreactor (TFHFBR) set- up 
Membrane modules were received from the Institute for Polymer Science of the University of Stellenbosch. The reactors were built on a frame of stainless steel rods and made watertight by the addition of greased gaskets between the module and the manifolds.

4.2.2 TFHFBR system configuration 
The TFHFBR was operated in a dead end filtration mode in the configuration shown 
in Fig 4.3. The air was humidified by passing it through distilled water and pumped through the system by an aquarium pump. A peristaltic pump circulated the medium. 
The membrane module was initially pre-treated with Milli-Q water to remove the 
glycerol wetting agent. Feed flow rates were determined and adjusted to 1mL/h.

4.2.3 TFHFBR operation 
The TFHFBR was chemically sterilised by running 4% (v/v) formaldehyde through the system overnight. Formaldehyde solution was rinsed from the HFBR with autoclaved Milli-Q water. The 500mM inoculum was prepared as for flask culture and decanted into a modified 1 L Ehrlenmeyer flask with an inoculation port at the base. The TFHFBR was inoculated from the shell-side using the airline in dead-end filtration 
mode with a peristaltic pump. The inoculum was forced into the module until a 
backpressure of 150 kPa was reached (the maximum safe pressure of the system). The pump was then switched off until the pressure subsided to approximately 130 kPa at which point the cycle was repeated. The reason for doing this was to force the 
homogenised mycelia onto the hollow fibres and so initiate attachment. Growth 
medium was run into the lumen and then left overnight. The fungal mycelium grows towards the growth medium in the lumen and in so doing the biofilm attaches to the hollow fibres.  Thereafter feed flow rates were determined and adjusted to achieve a flux of 0.177 L/m
2/h. The TFHFBR was operated for 20 days in a dead-end filtration 
mode with the substrate perfusing through the lumen and the immobilised biomass 
situated on the shell side of the hollow fibre membranes. On day 20, p-cresol (0.1 
mM) was added to the reactor feed. The reactor permeate was assayed daily for 
changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential and laccase activity.  
  
  
724.2.4 TBR set-up 
The TBR vessel used had a height of 400mm and an internal diameter of 70mm. The 
air was introduced through a sparger at 40mm and a sampling/drain port inserted at 
20 mm. Four lengths of glass tubing (I.D. 8mm) were inserted into and through a 
rubber stopper, these acted as droppers through which the growth medium and pollutant was introduced (Fig 4.4).  
4.2.5 TBR operation 
The reactor vessel was filled with support matrix until a headspace of 75 mm was 
achieved. The stopper was then fixed firmly in place and the entire reactor, including all feed and airlines, was sterilised as a unit by autoclaving. A 1 L inoculum was prepared as for flask culture and poured aseptically into the reactor. This was left in 
the vessel for 24 hours to allow fungal attachment. After this time, the drain valve 
was opened and the residual inoculum wasted.     The feed line attached to the droppers was then attached to a medium reservoir and 
growth medium was pumped into the reactor at a flow rate of 10 mL/h. The stopper 
was periodically rotated in an attempt to avoid channelling of the medium down the length of the reactor. After 7 d of operation in this fashion, the growth medium was replaced with one made up in 20 % cresylic effluent. This medium was recycled after passage through the reactor. Samples of reactor permeate were taken daily at the 
sampling port and assayed for laccase activity and residual cresols as required.

4.2.6 SEM preparation 
Sections of hollow fibre and glass bead with attached biomass were incubated in 
2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 C for 90 min to cross-link the biofilm and prevent 
detachment from the support matrix. Thereafter preparation as in previous chapter. 
 
4.3 Results  
 
4.3.1 Growth in the TFHFBR  
Membrane bioreactors designed specifically for microbial cell immobilisation are now 
used in a number of biotechnological processes, often in extraction applications. The first report of membrane use in biological wastewater treatment was made in 1969 
and since then the successful treatment of numerous priority pollutants has been 
reported, for example, Luke and Burton (2001). The hollow fibres used in this system present a compromise between solid and liquid growth medium combining the best of both environments by providing a secure point of attachment and access to readily utilisable nutrients in the form of liquid growth medium. The reactors were inoculated 
and run initially with growth medium only, Fig. 4.5 shows the changes in pH and 
 
  
74oxidation-reduction potential in the reactor permeate over time. Both these 
parameters are indications of fungal activity; one of the survival strategies of WRF is to lower the pH of their environment. Significant alterations in these values were 
observed after the airflow was increased from 1 L/min to 2 L/min on day 9: pH 
decreased and redox potential increased. Addition of 0.1 mM p-cresol on day 20 had 
the effect of reversing these changes.  
 It is likely that increasing the airflow increased the growth rate of T. versicolor in the 
reactor, as increased oxygen tension is known to stimulate the growth of WRF. The 
addition of p-cresol retarded fungal growth, as measured by the pH and redox activity 
indicators. Laccase activity was measured in the permeate samples of days three to 
nine, showing a maximum of 0.7 U/mL. There was no measurable laccase activity in the permeate after the p- cresol was added to the medium reservoir. This may have 
been coincidental with the increased airflow in the reactor as White and Boddy 
(1992b) showed that maximum enzyme activity produced by T. versicolor  in solid 
state was achieved at an environmental oxygen concentration of only 5 %. These 
authors further correlated decreased fungal growth activity with insufficient airflow, 
and this may be another switch that induces secondary metabolism and enzyme production. HPLC analysis of the permeate after day 20 showed no remaining cresol in the permeate but an increase in the concentration of cresol reaction products.

75Two further reactors were configured, inoculated and operated with growth medium 
only for 7 days. After this time, different (1mM, 2.5 mM, 5mM and 7.5 mM) 
concentrations of p -cresol were added to the medium reservoir of both. The reactor 
permeate was assayed daily for residual cresol. Cresol was continuously and 
completely removed up to a concentration of 5mM, above which there appeared to 
be a breakthrough point (Fig 4.6). The 7.5 mM p- cresol feed was initially all 
removed, representing a removal rate of 0.0486 g p- cresol/g biomass/d but over time 
increasing amounts were observed in the reactor permeate. Continuous dosing at 
this concentration was apparently above the threshold of the fungus in this reactor configuration, possibly due to a build-up of toxic intermediates.     While investigating the effects of biocarriers on the production of lignin-degrading peroxidase activity in P. chrysosporium,  Shim and Kawamoto (2002) found that a 
static culture, immobilised on a ‘Biostage’ support had distinct advantages over free cultures in terms of (1) better growth of fungi (2) higher enzyme activity; and (3) longer lasting enzyme activity. These authors ascribe these effects to a lack of 
oxygen supply to the free fungal cells in submerged culture, a result being that the 
cells were prone to sedimentation. This immobilised method of incubation was found to in increase the contact area between cells and the sparged oxygen without increasing shear. Shuttleworth and Bollag (1986) found that the most promising alternative to direct enzyme treatment to transform phenols was to immobilise the 
mycelia in such a way as to provide continuous production of oxidative enzymes, as 
has been achieved in this study.

76The TFHFBR represents an attempt to mimic conditions encountered by fungi in 
nature and promoted fungal growth at the solid/air interface that these organisms have evolved to colonise. To ascertain whether this environment was achieved in the reactor it was necessary to visually inspect the growth morphology of T. versicolor.  
The TFHFBR was sacrificed and sections of the hollow fibre membranes examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM photographs show growth on 
the membrane (Fig 4.7A) and that the differentiation within the biofilm of T. versicolor 
grown on hollow fibre membranes also exhibited the developmental variation 
reported for growth on wood. The biomass closest to the lumen displayed the characteristic fast-effuse growth associated primary growth phase under optimum nutrient conditions with binding and skeletal hyphae the dominant morphs (Fig. 4.7B, C). The next region in the cross section is dominated by generative growth, where 
the biomass is highly branched and has become gelatinised an indication of slow-
dense growth (Fig 4.7D). The outside edge of the biofilm is characterised by less dense, desiccated hyphae in the process of being sloughed off (Fig 4.7E).

These results support the gradostat concept and show clearly that the capillary membrane did provide the nutrient gradient it was expected to. In any long- term 
operation of a fungal bioreactor, a number of operational problems such as: increase 
of broth viscosity, formation of mycelial aggregates, electrode fouling and clogging  
  
78often occur. These are caused by the uncontrolled morphology and growth of mycelia 
that limits biomass transfer and hampers performance (Moreira et al., 1998). The 
configuration of the TFHFBR and the growth morphology that it promotes ameliorate 
these problems to some extent. The thickness of the biofilm is limited by the 
perfusion of the growth medium from the membrane lumen; the dead biomass is continuously sloughed off and washed out of the reactor. Therefore the reactor contains only living, productive biomass and successfully maintains stable conditions 
for secondary metabolism and controls fungal growth. This enables constant enzyme 
production and phenolic degradation.   
4.3.2 Growth of T. versicolor in a TBR 
The growth on the glass beads was dense, white and covered all the available surfaces. When the beads in the trickle filter were fully covered, new growth medium 
was added to the reservoir and samples of the permeate were assayed for laccase enzyme activity. After a growth period of 7 days, the growth medium in the reservoir was replaced with 20% vol/vol cresylic effluent (made up in growth medium). The 
addition of the effluent resulted in a substantial increase in laccase activity (Fig 4.8). 
The fungus became slightly discoloured, with brown residue forming on the beads. A similarly coloured pellet was formed when samples taken from the reactor were centrifuged. The components of the pellet were assumed to comprise of polymerized phenolic monomers.

79It is interesting to note that a high effluent concentration (20%) resulted in an 
increase of secreted laccase enzyme (Fig 4.8) whereas in unimmobilised cultures, this concentration retarded both growth and enzyme production. These results are in agreement with those of Nakamura et al . (1999) who compared free versus 
immobilized culture conditions for another widely utilized WRF, Bjerkandera adusta . 
No significant differences in cell growth and glucose utilization were observed, but a significantly higher enzyme activity, coupled to more extensive delignification activity, 
was reported for the immobilised cultures. This result confirmed the suitability of the 
glass support for growth of T. versicolor and the advantages of biomass 
immobilization of in terms of resistance toxic compounds. The medium containing the 
effluent was recycled for the duration of the experiment and all the phenolic monomers had been removed from solution by the end of the operational period 
(Table 4.1).

Closer inspection of sections of the glass beads by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) showed thick, linear hyphae covering individual beads with a continuous 
fungal of fungi (Figs 4.9B, 4.9C). The hyphae had penetrated and attached to the glass beads (Fig 4.9A) and had formed septate clamp connections which only occur during generative (healthy) growth. The linear hyphae indicated rapid growth and 
were not covered in polysaccharide, as would expected under conditions of stress 
(Fig 4.9B). These factors indicate that the culture was growing well, even after being exposed to 20% cresylic effluent for 7 days. The glass beads used in the support were uniformly covered with a mat of fungus. In Fig 4.9 C the mat had pulled away slightly from the support, probably due to the critical point drying process in the EM 
preparation, but nevertheless can be seen to be continuous. 
 Due to the hydrophobic nature of the glass that makes up the beads and their high porosity, the fungus formed a secure attachment to the porous glass support. The 
anchoring effect of the glass beads and the ability of the fungus to withstand up to  
  
8020% concentration of the cresylic effluent while attached to them indicate that these 
beads are a suitable support for the growth of T. versicolor.  Pallerla and Chambers 
(1997) observed similar results in a study on the bioremediation of foul condensates 
from a pulp and paper plant, where immobilised T. versiciolor was found to withstand 
the inhibiting nature of the effluent more than was observed in batch culture. The authors showed that immobilised cells were able to tolerate higher concentrations of toxic compounds and degrade higher concentrations of reactants as compared to 
free cells.

4.4 Conclusions 
 
 The TFHFBR promoted good fungal growth and differentiation according 
to the gradostat concept for the production of secondary metabolites.  
o The system facilitated the removal of cresol up to a concentration of 
7.5 mM (0.05 g/g biomass/d) although there was very little measurable 
free laccase in the reactor permeate.  
o The low flow rates associated with this reactor configuration and the 
difficulty of scale-up would impede its application in a wastewater 
treatment role  
o A good application of this system could be in low volume, high value 
biotransformations of phenolic substrates by fungal oxidases (e.g. antioxidants) or in the production of valuable secondary metabolites from other filamentous organisms. 
 
 The TBR facilitated excellent growth when operated with a culture of T. 
versicolor immobilised on woven glass beads.  
 
  
82o The immobilised fungus tolerated and removed high (20%) 
concentrations of cresylic effluent in the reactor configuration and 
produce over 1 U/mL/d of laccase.  
o An obvious advantage of the TBR is the almost complete lack of shear 
forces and the potential for excellent oxygen mass transfer; two  
o This system represents a low maintenance alternative to other 
bioreactor configurations. Its resistance to high concentrations of 
effluent presents a possible application for the TBR as pre-treatment 
for another system to buffer possible variations in effluent strength (shock loading).  
o A possible improvement to the TBR design would be to introduce 
baffles at intervals along the length of the reactor vessel to break up 
the paths and prevent the channelling of liquid that is often inevitable 
in these systems.  
o Although this bioreactor system performed at least as well as 
anticipated, the growth of T. versicolor was slow compared to agitated 
free culture and enzyme production was lower.   
  
83CHAPTER 5 : DEVELOPMENT OF BIORE ACTORS (PART 2) - AIRLIFT LOOP 
REACTOR (ALR) FOR LACCASE PRODUCTION AND BIOREMEDIATION BY 
TRAMETES  SPECIES 
 
5.1 Introduction 
Although reasonably effective as bioremediation tools, both the membrane gradostat 
reactor and the trickle filter had shortcomings in their potential for large volume 
wastewater treatment due to difficulty in up-scaling them. Airlift reactors have been found suitable for the fermentation of filamentous microorganisms due to the low shear, highly oxygenated environment they provide. Furthermore, the upscale of 
these reactors is an established field of study. Therefore an investigation of an ALR 
system seemed to be the next logical step, as these reactors are understood to have potential in fungal bioprocesses. They provide a well-mixed, highly oxygenated environment, with well-defined flow pattern and high liquid velocities that occur despite an absence of a mechanical agitator and can create an optimal environment for many productive microorganisms (Klein et al.,  2002).  
 
5.1.1 Bubble recirculation and gas holdup in ALRS 
Siegel et al. (1986) described the existence of different flow regimes in internal-loop 
airlift reactors, which depended in the design of the gas-liquid separator and the 
liquid velocity in the downcomer. More recently Heijnen et al.  (1997) described the 
existence of three distinct regimes. At very low air input rates, no air bubbles are 
present in the downcomer as the liquid velocity in the downcomer is lower than the 
average slip velocity of the air bubbles in the liquid, this is referred to as 
heterogeneous flow . The liquid velocity increases rapidly when the superficial gas 
velocity is increased until the liquid velocity in the downcomer is equal to the slip 
velocity of the air bubbles (bubble slip velocity is the difference between the linear velocity of the gas and the liquid in the column). This results in stationary air bubbles 
in the downcomer i.e. the velocity of the bubbles relative to the reactor is zero. The 
downcomer can be either partially or completely filled with bubbles, called transition 
flow.  As the superficial gas velocity is further increased, the liquid velocity in the 
downcomer becomes higher than the slip velocity of the air bubbles and the bubbles 
are recirculated with the liquid from the downcomer into the riser, called uniform 
bubbly flow . Gas holdup, the volume fraction of gas in the dispersion, in the riser can 
be as high as 20%.  Knowing the relationships between gas holdup and superficial gas velocity is important because it determines liquid circulation velocity. On this basis, internal loop ALRs can be designed and the operational parameter, superficial 
gas velocity can be coupled with mixing time and gas liquid transfer rate (van  
  
84Benthum et al.,  1999).  The head region of the airlift reactor can be designed to 
ensure near complete gas liquid separation, so that the downcomer gas holdup is 
zero, ensuring optimal liquid circulation. This design (for an internal loop reactor) is 
based on the principle of reducing the downward liquid velocity in the entrance of the 
downcomer to less than the rise velocity, if the bubbles are to be kept out of the downcomer. This can be achieved by expanding the cross-sectional area of the downcomer in the head region of the reactor. Care must be taken to avoid boundary 
layer separation and the formation of stagnant regions (Chisti and Moo-Young, 
1993).  
5.1.2 Effect of sparger aperture size (porosity) 
In bubbly flow, bubbles rise in the riser and descend in the downcomer 
independently, with fairly uniform spacing between them, and therefore, holdup rises 
almost linearly as gas velocity increases. In transition flow the uniform bubble swarms begin to meander, revealing the formation of small eddies in the liquid. The change from uniform to transition flow is gradual, and has been attributed to various 
factors that affect the size of the bubbles by altering the degree of coalescence and 
therefore their rise velocity (Contreras et al. , 1999). Because spargers with larger 
pore sizes produce bubbles with greater diameter coalescence begins at lowest gas 
velocity with these spargers. The differences in circulation time in the uniform bubbly and transition flow regimes are directly related to downcomer holdup. In these two 
flow regimes the recirculation of gas to the downcomer is highest for spargers with 
the lowest pore diameter, producing the smallest bubbles. This implies lower rise velocities and thus greater gas recirculation. When pore size increases, both the mean size of the bubbles and their rise velocity increase, the gas recirculates less so 
the difference between riser and downcomer densities increases, and therefore, 
liquid circulation time is decreased. In heterogeneous flow, turbulence in the bulk fluid controls the hydrodynamic behaviour. This means that bubble size is ultimately not determined by the porosity of the sparger but the degree of coalescence and therefore holdup and liquid circulation time are similar for all spargers used (Contreras et al. , 1999).  
 Reactor performance in ALRs is strongly affected by the coalescence and viscosity of the liquid, and these factors often change considerably during batch culture (Poulsen 
and Iverson, 1999). Since both gas-liquid mass transfer (optimised using small 
bubbles) and mixing (when larger bubbles are required) are driven by the gas stream, the bubble size is an important variable. Bubble size is determined by  
  
85sparger design, liquid properties, and reactor geometry. In coalescent liquids the 
equilibrium bubble size (4-6mm in water) is obtained very rapidly, and the formation of smaller bubbles at the sparger has no influence on the actual bubble size. In 
noncoalescent liquid the actual bubble size is very close to the size at the sparger 
(Poulsen and Iverson, 1999).     Poulsen and Iverson (1999) developed a rubber membrane sparger, which produced 
small bubbles, giving high mass transfer. They then designed a combined membrane 
- ring sparger with unique features with respect to efficiency of utilisation of energy and substrate gases. Their experiments showed that the small bubbles from the membrane sparger did not coalesce with the large bubbles from the ring sparger. In the dual sparging mode the energy input for mass transfer and mixing is divided. 
Therefore, the energy consumption can be minimised if the flow distribution through 
the membrane and ring sparger is controlled by the oxygen demand and the inhomogeneity of the culture medium respectively. In addition it would be possible to deliver a hazardous or expensive gas quantitatively to the liquid through the 
membrane sparger (Poulsen and Iverson, 1999). 
 
5.1.3 Shear forces in ALRs 
Gas-liquid mass transfer rate depends strongly on the hydrodynamics near the gas-
liquid interface of a system; therefore, interfacial shear rate affects mass transfer (Contreras et al., 1999). In most chemical processes, the shear rate is not important 
in itself, except as a means of increasing heat and mass transfer. This is not the case in less robust biological systems such as microbial plant and animal cell culture. Excessive shear is known to damage suspended cells, leading to loss of viability and 
even disruption. However, a certain degree of shearing is required to attain sufficient 
mass transfer rates and to achieve a homogenous distribution of transferred components into the bulk fluid and to prevent anoxic dead zones in the reactor. Consequently, bioreactors that provide a gentle culture environment are in increasing demand. One of the principal reasons for the success of ALRs is the mildness of the 
shear effects on the particles suspended in the liquid. This mildness is due 
homogeneity of the shear field and the absence of zones of excessive turbulence (high shear regions) in this type of reactor, in contrast to STRs where the energy input is highly localised (Merchuk and Berzin, 1995). The more ordered, less 
turbulent flow seems to have a positive effect on the yields of shear sensitive 
cultures.   
  
86The shear stress in the liquid of each region of an ALR can be defined as equal to 
the energy dissipated divided by the mean path of circulation in the region and by the sum of the area of all the bubbles (Merchuk and Berzin, 1995). It is well known that 
energy is dissipated in ALRs by two main mechanisms: wall friction and bubble 
associated dissipation. Merchuk and Berzin (1995) confirmed that the energy lost at the walls of the reactor is a minor contribution.  Therefore, the energy dissipation in the bulk of the liquid is unequivocally related to the bubbles present in the system 
and gives a global shear rate related to the interfacial area of the dispersed gas, 
which is in turn related to the mass transfer of the system. They conclude that this global shear rate is a function of both fluid dynamics and rheology and can be calculated for each region in the ALR. It increases sharply at low gas flow rate and then remains almost constant, with the riser playing a predominant role as long as 
the bottom clearance is sufficient.   
 The shear rate behaves differently in different flow regimes. In bubbly flow, the shear rate increases slightly with increasing gas flow rate and tends to flatten out in the 
heterogeneous flow regime. At the low gas velocities, the spargers with the lowest 
pore sizes produce the lowest shear rates, at very high velocities shear rate become 
independent of pore size (Contreras et al., 1999). The highest shear rates occur in 
the bottom zone, followed by the gas-liquid separator and the riser, showing the 
importance of the bottom zone and separator in overall behaviour and scale up of 
this type of system.  
 The lowest shear rates are found in the downcomer where turbulence in minimised. Shear rate is also strongly related to the characteristic length or internal scale of the 
micro-eddies found in the bulk fluid. Shear rate declines as the eddy length 
increases. For a fixed characteristic length the shear rate decreases when pore size i.e. bubble size, diminishes. This indicates that the smaller the eddy sizes the greater the shear rate and thus hydrodynamic stress and the possibility of cell damage 
(Contreras et al.,  1999). 
 
5.1.4 Mass transfer in ALRs 
Gas-liquid transfer is often a limiting factor in many aerobic fermentations; therefore 
the determination of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, K
La, is an important 
factor in the design and operation of ALRs. Despite many previous attempts to model the rate of mass transfer at the gas-liquid interface, it is not yet possible to give a 
clear-cut theoretical explanation of experimental data relating to K
La (Ayazi Shamlou  
  
87et al.,  1995). This is due to the abundance of parameters that are known to influence 
the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the complex interactions that exist 
among them. Experimental measurements show that the rate of mass transfer in an 
ALR is influenced by the physicochemical properties of the two-phase mixture, the 
superficial gas velocity, the gas hold-up and the liquid circulation velocity (Ayazi 
Shamlou et al., 1995). In general, for draught tube, internal loop ALRs there is no 
influence of either the presence of a draught tube or of its relative area with respect 
to the annulus on the overall gas holdup i.e. they can be related to simple bubble 
columns. This does not mean, however, that K La is the same. The enhanced K La 
observed in ALRs is explained by of the different bubble size distributions that occur in bubble columns and ALRs under otherwise identical conditions (Chisti and Moo-Young, 1987). 
 
When a population of bubbles reaches the disengagement zone at the top of the riser, the larger bubbles separate relatively easily from the liquid and therefore the bubbles recirculating in the downcomer at the top are likely to have a lower diameter 
than those in the riser. These bubbles can subsequently grow through coalescence 
further downstream in the downcomer. The gas holdup and liquid circulation velocity in the downcomer are in fact lower than that of the riser, but the K
La in the upper 
portion of the downcomer exceeds that of the riser. In the lower part of the downcomer the K
La values are comparable to those in the riser. It appears, therefore, 
that the effect of bubble diameter on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient dominates over the combined effect of gas holdup and liquid circulation velocity 
(Ayazi Shamlou et al.,  1995). For the lower gas velocities spargers with small pore 
sizes produce the highest K
La with the lowest global shear rates. The smallest pore 
sizes are more efficient for mass transfer because the small size of bubbles is 
conserved in the reactor is conserved in the reactor, rendering a high interfacial area 
(Contreras et al.,  1999). 
 
In this chapter the development of an ALR reactor system employing a whole cell culture of T. pubescens  to remove phenolic compounds from a coal gasification plant 
is described. Although these reactors were tested initially with T. versicolor , when the 
T. pubescens  strain became available, the elevated laccase production and superior 
growth rates of this strain indicated that it would provide a better agent for a 
bioremediation bioprocess.  
   
  
885.2 Methods 
 
5.2.1 Culture and growth conditions 
Trametes pubescens  (CBS 696.94) was maintained on 2% malt agar plates. The 
culture medium used contained 10g/L glucose and peptone and 2g/L KH 2PO 4. 
 
5.2.2 Inoculum preparation 
T. pubescens  from plate culture was homogenized in growth medium and used to 
inoculate 300mL-sterilized medium in 2L Erlenmeyer flasks. These flasks were 
incubated at 28 C and 175 rpm. The gyratory motion of the shaker promoted uniform 
pellet formation and this speed was found to produce small, dense pellets. Four-day-
old pellets from these cultures were used as a reactor inoculum.   
5.2.3 ALR operation 
The concentric draught-tube internal loop airlift reactor used in this work was 
manufactured in the workshop of the Chemistry Dept., Rhodes University. The vessel had a height of 500mm, an aspect ratio (H/D) of 4.5 and a working volume of 3.5L. The draught tube had a diameter of 55mm. Initially air was supplied by an aquarium 
pump at a fixed rate of 2.2L/min, but this was later optimized. The reactor was filled 
with 3.15 L of growth medium and autoclaved. After cooling a 350mL (10%) inoculum was aseptically introduced and the air supply attached, initiating the fermentation. In the pollutant degradation experiments, a three-day initial growth period was allowed 
before any stripped gas liquor (SGL) effluent was added. Thereafter 2% v/v effluent 
was added daily to one reactor, 3.5% to a second and 5 % to a third.  
5.2.4 ALR Sampling 
5mL samples were aseptically drawn from the ALR and replaced with glucose-free 
growth medium. Samples were centrifuged to remove suspended biomass and 
glucose and laccase activity assays were performed on the supernatant. In the experiments where pollutants were added to the reactor, the air supply was terminated for 10 minutes to allow the biomass to settle and 100mL of cell-free 
culture medium withdrawn from the reactor. This volume was replaced with effluent 
appropriately diluted with growth medium.   
5.2.5 Glucose determination 
Glucose concentrations in culture media were determined spectrophotometrically by 
the DNS (dinitrosalicyclic acid) method according to Ghose (1987).  
  
895.3 Results  
 
5.3.1 Optimisation of air supply rate and oxygen mass transfer 
A disadvantage of high-density fermentations of filamentous biomass is the reduced efficiency of oxygen transfer in such cultures. Since oxygen is an essential nutrient for aerobic biochemical processes, optimisation of oxygen transfer in the bioreactor is essential for the successful application of these fungi. Initial experiments were 
conducted with a fixed airflow rate (2.2 L/min for the 3L reactor volume). However, at 
high cell densities, pelletted biomass was observed to accumulate in parts of the bioreactor, particularly at the base of the vessel. Measurement with a submerged dissolved oxygen (DO) probe showed that th ese areas were anoxic, indicating that 
the airflow rate being used was insufficient and needed to be optimised. All the main 
performance indicators of pneumatic reactors: gas hold-up, mixing time, axial 
dispersion coefficients for gas and liquid phases and the overall mass transfer coefficient have been correlated with gas throughput (Chisti and Moo Young, 1987). Accordingly, several flow rates where investigated. The increase in dissolved oxygen 
(DO) in the reactor fluid was measured for airflow rates between 2 and 5.5 L/min to 
determine the airflow required for optimum mass transfer (Fig 5.1A).  For aeration rates above 3 L/min there was little difference in the maximum dissolved oxygen achieved in the reactor.

Fig 5.1B The effect of increasing airflow on the oxygen mass transfer 
coefficient (K La) in an ALR 
 
Oxygen mass transfer increased non-linearly with increasing airflow into the reactor 
to a maximum of K La = 0.52 /s achieved at a flow of 5.5 L/min. However, a flow rate 
of 3.5 L/min delivered a K La of 0.45 /s. Thus, 87% of the maximum oxygen mass 
transfer was achieved from only 64% of the corresponding airflow rate. From a power usage and cost benefit position, the lower flow would be preferable. These measurements were all obtained with only growth medium in the ALR. Having 
respiring fungi in the reactor would obviously have an effect on oxygen transfer. Su 
and He (1997) found that the effect of aeration rate becomes more pronounced at 
higher biomass loading. Testing at the maximum biomass concentration achieved in this study indicated that a gas (air) injection of 3.5 L/min was sufficient to prevent any anoxic zones forming in the reactor and all further experiments were conducted using this flow rate 
 
The OTR in the ALR was measured at the top and bottom of the draught tube and was found to be different at different positions in the reactor. This may have be due to the different local dissolved oxygen concentrations in the liquid and oxygen partial 
pressures in the bubbles. Both determine the driving force of oxygen into solution. 
Also, different transport cross-sections are to be expected to be different, in different parts of the internal loop reactor this is due to different bubble sizes and number densities. The highest dissolved oxygen concentrations in the reactor used in this study were found at the top of the downcomer. Initially, this was surprising, as one 
would expect the highest concentrations close to where the air was introduced i.e.  
  
91the bottom of the riser. However this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that 
at the top of the riser there was an accumulation of small bubbles. There was a balance achieved in this area for a certain bubble size where their rise velocity is 
almost balanced by the effect of the fluid flow in the downcomer. The increased 
concentration of bubbles resulted in increased dissolved oxygen. The OTR was obviously also affected by airflow rate. The rate calculated from a plot of dC
O2L/dt 
correlated very well with that obtained from a fitted model, based on K La values, 
(Table 5.1) where calculated K La values were substituted into the equation:  
 
OTR =   dC/dt = K La*(C sat-CL).

An alternative to increasing airflow would be to increase the oxygen content of the air provided. Increasing the oxygen concentration (Y
O2) of the influent air would result in 
a higher value for saturation concentration (C sat) and hence an increase in OTR. 
Increasing the oxygen content to 30% (from 21% in air) resulted in an increase in 
specific growth rate ( ) of 40% from 0.251 to 0.422 per day. The biomass formed 
smaller, pellets and achieved an overall concentration of 16.93 g/L (dry mass). 
 
5.3.2 Growth in an ALR - effects on fungal morphology 
When grown in submerged culture, filamentous fungi exhibit different morphological 
forms, ranging from free mycelial trees to densely interwoven mycelial masses 
referred to as pellets. The particular form exhibited is determined not only by the genotype of the strain, but also by the nature of the inoculum as well as the physical, chemical and culture conditions (Papagianni and Moo-Young, 2002). The mechanical forces in a fermenter, which, in the case of an ALR would primarily be aeration rate, 
have a critical role in determining the morphology type.  When discussing pellet 
morphology, the quantitative measurement is pellet size, which does not include the hyphae on the outer zone of the pellets that are called the ‘hair’.  It is known that  
  
92agitation can influence the size of the pellets and the structure of the pellets surface 
(smooth or fluffy). Since higher agitation will result in higher oxygen tension and more 
branching of hyphae, the pellets formed may be denser and stronger. Cui et al . 
(1997) proposed a shaving mechanism caused by the effects of agitation on pellet 
morphology. The hairs on the outer zone of the pellets are chipped off by the mechanical forces induced by turbulent flow in the fluid. The severity of the cutting is a function of hyphal strength and the magnitude of these forces. The chipped hyphae 
form filamentous mycelia and reseed the formation of new pellets. This shaving 
motion also restricts pellet size. Pellet size is thus related to energy dissipation rate, but this applies mainly to stirred tank reactors, in an ALR system the same could be said of aeration rate, as it is this parameter that provides the agitation. Therefore, in the growth phase of the fermentation in an ALR, a higher rate of aeration is required, 
to stimulate new pellet formation, thereafter it could be decreased to a level where it 
just ensures sufficient oxygenation of the biomass. Controlling aeration, therefore, is another potential method for controlling biomass formation, and may find particular use preventing overproduction of biomass. 
 
Morphological growth forms can have a significant effect on the rheology of the fermentation broth and thus on bioreactor performance. Pelleted morphologies result in Newtonian (constant viscosity) broths and better mass transfer rates as compared to viscous and often pseudoplastic (where apparent viscosity decreases with 
increasing shear) filamentous broths. However, autolysis due to oxygen limitation, in 
pellets that become too large results in a large portion of the fungal mass being metabolically inactive. The extensive morphological differentiation exhibited by filamentous organisms is often associated with their involvement in chemical 
differentiation. A close relationship between a particular morphological form and 
increased process productivities is characteristic for industrially important fermentations e.g. citric acid and penicillin. Furthermore, pelleted morphologies are related to lower levels of formation and release of harmful proteases (Su and He, 1997; Jin et al., 2002; Papagianni and Moo-Young, 2002). It is apparent therefore 
that mycelial aggregates should be viewed as complex differentiated tissues and not 
as mechanical conglomerates (Papagianni and Moo-Young, 2002)  Inoculum quality (size and age) is also of great importance in determining the 
outcome of filamentous fermentations (Papagianni and Moo-Young, 2002). By 
controlling and manipulating this factor, together with feed and aeration rates, it  
  
93should be possible to keep the pellets of T. pubescens  from becoming oversized and 
from sedimenting out and so creating mass transfer and mixing problems. 
 
5.3.3 Laccase production during fermentation of T. pubescens  
To establish the details of growth of T. pubescens  in an ALR, a fermentation was 
initiated by a 10 % inoculum and a starting concentration of 10 g/L glucose, aeration 
was fixed at 3.5 L/min. Figure 5.4 illustrates the relationship between glucose 
utilisation, biomass accumulation and product (laccase) formation for a fermentation 
of T. pubescens  in an ALR. The shapes of the curves are in agreement with those of 
classic concentration-time profiles for batch operation. The culture had a specific 
OUR of 0.02 mgO 2/L/s/g biomass and plotting Ln X/X 0 gave a specific growth rate ( ) 
of 0 .25 per day. The fermentation reached a maximum biomass concentration of 8.7 
g/L dry mass.  This result compares favourably with a report on an optimised stirred tank fermentation of T. pubescens  where a growth (biomass) maximum of 10.6 g/L 
was reported after 12.5 days of cultivation, from a starting concentration of 40 g/L 
glucose (Galhaup et al.,  2002). This is a significantly lower biomass yield (0.265 g 
biomass/g glucose) than that achieved in the ALR fermentation in this study (0.87 
g/g). Too much biomass would not always be beneficial to a process as this can lead 
to blockages and sludge problems. Bioreactor cultures can become too crowded and 
at increased cell densities some pellets can be forced into settling (Su and He, 1997).   
Although Rodriguez Couto et al.  (2002) reported that attempts to produce laccase at 
a bioreactor scale have been unsuccessful, Rancano et al . (2003) cultured T. 
versicolor in an airlift reactor with a working volume of 2 L, reporting a glucose 
consumption rate of 0.42 g/L/day from a starting concentration of 20 g/L and a 
maximum (2,5-xylidine induced) laccase activity if 1.67 U/mL achieved after 13 days of cultivation; cellular growth was not recorded. Laccase activity in the ALR 
fermentation in this study reached a maximum of 2.54 U/mL after 7 days without 
induction. It is difficult to compare data from different size reactors with different configurations and operating conditions, but the increased glucose consumption shown in Fig 5.4 (1.58 g/L/d) is certainly an indicator of an increased growth rate and the laccase activity in the ALR was 1.5 times that of Rancano et al. (2003), and was 
achieved in half the time (Fig 5.2).

An additional measure of cell growth or activity is respiration, measured as oxygen 
utilisation rate (OUR). OUR is dependent on both the amount of biomass and phase 
of growth. As OUR = - dC02/dt, it was possible to calculate it from the rate (slopes) of 
oxygen depletion measured for samples of biomass drawn from the ALR over the 
time course of the fermentation (Fig. 5.3). As would be expected, the OUR (as calculated by the decrease in DO) increased rapidly during the growth phase of the 
fermentation, until day 4, and then gradually decreased as the growth slowed and 
entered stationary phase. When related to the amount of biomass in the reactor, giving specific OUR (Fig 5.4), there was an increase during the short lag phase followed by a period where it remains fairly constant, showing that the increase in 
OUR was correlated with an increase in biomass, as the culture enters stationary 
phase, the specific OUR decreased rapidly, indicating that the total amount of biomass, although it increased, became less metabolically active.

5.3.4 Effect of effluent addition on biomass morphology and laccase 
production 
Airlift reactors containing TDM were inoculated (10%) with T. pubescens  and the 
fermentation allowed to progress with the airflow fixed at 3.5 L/min. At the end of the 
initial growth period of 7 days, increasing concentrations of the phenolic effluent used 
previously was added to the ALR. These additions of SGL effluent had visible effects 
on biomass morphology and the appearance and consistency of the reactor fluid.  
  
96The size and gross morphology of the control and 2 % (v/v) reactors was also more 
consistent, with the pellets consisting of a dense core surrounded by fine hairs (Fig 5.5 A, B). The pellets in the reactors inoculated with 3.5 and 5 % (v/v) effluent settled 
faster and were darker in colour than those of the control and 2 % reactors. Closer 
inspection by light microscopy revealed that the pellets in the heavily dosed reactors (3.5 and 5 %) were irregularly shaped, smaller overall, less hairy and appeared to be simply a loose conglomeration of mycelia, with loose filaments extruding from 
mycelial masses (Fig 5.5 C, D). Su and He (1997) reported that over-stressed 
cultures of Neurospora crassa  developed long mycelia on the pellets and that this 
was an indication of loss of viability. Control of pellet morphology has been achieved previously by the application of pulsing flow to fluidised bed reactor (Moreira et al.,  
1996). It was reported here that decreasing pellet size and increased hairiness 
increased the active surface area of mycelia and resulted in better oxygen availability 
and higher productivity.   
Changes to mycelial mats observed in the present study in flask cultures of T. 
pubescens  after effluent addition included browning, shrinkage and fewer aerial 
mycelia. Electron microscopy revealed thinner more highly branched mycelia (section 
3.3.2). These physiological adaptations have been correlated with higher laccase activity and increased removal of phenols (sections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5).  Browning of fungal tissues often results from enzymic oxidation of phenolic substrates by 
phenoloxidases and peroxidases (White and Boddy, 1992), as would be expected in 
this case, after addition of a phenolic pollutant. Careful control of pollutant addition could actually become a tool in manipulating the size and activity of the pelletted culture in the ALR system. Should the biomass become too dense or the mycelial 
pellets too large, effluent could be added to slow the growth and reduce pellet size.

98Although laccase formation in T. pubescens  has previously been reported as not being 
growth associated (Galhaup et. al.,  2002) the parallel increase of laccase activity with 
biomass accumulation in ALR cultivation is clea r (Fig. 5.2).  This consistent production of 
laccase, even in uninduced fermentations, contrasts with other reports of unreliable 
enzyme production by white rot fungi in the ‘unfamiliar’ environment of liquid 
fermentation (Robinson et. al.,  2001). Since enzyme production and bioremediation or 
even biotransformations in liquid fermentation have obvious   advantages over solid 
substrate in terms of mixing, control and product recovery, this result is an important 
finding in terms of use of T. pubescens  and other white rot fungi. 
 
Laccase production was stimulated by the addi tion of cresylic effluent to the reactor. T. 
pubescens  has various physiological responses to local environmental challenges, in 
this case the addition of the pollutant. One of them is to produce more lignolytic 
enzymes.  It had already established from flask culture that the fungus was able to 
withstand up to 10% v/v of the effluent without obvious harmful effects. Biomass was 
largely unaffected and enzyme production was increased relative to the control. 
However, these concentrations had been ‘one-off’ additions. Sequential additions of 
effluent would conceivably have a cumulative effect and this was investigated in an ALR.  
The addition of 2.5 % (v/v) effluent increased laccase activity by almost 3 times; the 
subsequent addition of 5 % and 10 % appeared to have negative effects on the culture. The biomass decreased, became more prone to settling, and enzyme activity 
decreased. HPLC analysis showed that there were no residual phenol or cresols present 
in the reactor prior to the further additions  of effluent, and therefore there was no 
cumulative build up of these compounds. This indicates that even though there were 
some negative effects associated with effluent addition, the fungus removed all the aromatic toxins from solution.  
 
Free enzyme activity increased after falling from 2.7 U/mL, to 0.8 U/mL after the 5 % 
(v/v) addition (day 13) only to decrease from 1.95 U/mL, to almost zero after the 10 % (v/v) addition (day 19) after which time the culture died (Figure 5.6). It is possible 
however that these final effect effects were related to lack of glucose, rather than a 
phenolic concentration above the physiological limit of the fungus. This argument was at 
least partially validated in a further experiment in which the addition of glucose along with the aromatic pollutants allowed the fungus to contend with multiple doses of  
  
99effluent. The brown colour of the biomass and the culture fluid was also observed in 
flask culture (chapter 30. Klonowska et al.  (2001) reported a similar colouration effect 
produced by the aromatic acid, and known fungal toxin, p- hydroxybenzoic acid. These 
authors suggested that the brown colour was evidence of the fungus getting rid of toxin 
by polymerisation.  
 Basidiomycetes are known to exhibit widely varying responses in terms of effects elicited 
by aromatic compounds, particularly in laccase production. An individual aromatic 
compound may increase laccase titres without altering the isozyme pattern (Eggert et 
al., 1996), induce new isoforms (Bollag and Leonowicz, 1984) or have no induction effect (Coll et al.,  1993). Induction is considered to be a proactive response to toxic 
compounds produced either the degradation of lignin component of lignocellulosic 
residues (which serve as natural growth inhibitors to fungi) or to antimicrobial agents 
secreted by microbial competitors (Collins and Dobson, 1997, Chen et al.,  2003).  Iimura 
and Tatsumi (1997) isolated cDNAs of PCP-stressed T. versicolor  by differential display 
and found bands that were common and control/PCP-treated sample specific. RNA 
analysis found a 9.7-fold increase in the stress response protein HSP70, which is 
involved in adaptive response mechanisms, after PCP treatment. It is apparent therefore 
that induction using potentially toxic aromatic compounds is beneficial in terms of 
laccase production and bioremediation efficacy, as long as the toxic loading limit is not 
exceeded.

5.3.5 Optimisation of laccase production in an ALR 
A fed batch experiment was set up to evaluate the effect of sequential effluent additions of effluent fermentation cultures of T. pubescens. Multiple ALRs were run in parallel with 
different concentrations (2 %, 3.5 % and 5 % v/v) of phenolic effluent were then added 
daily to each. The effluent was added with a glucose stock to a final concentration of 0.5 g/L. The addition of the co-metabolite had the effect of both increasing and maintaining laccase production compared with sequential addi tions attempted before. This effect is 
in agreement with other recent studies that employed a ‘laccase production medium’ 
containing low, non-repressing concentrations of glucose to stimulate laccase production 
after primary cell growth was completed (Jang et al., 2002; Galhaup et al., 2002). The 
glucose consumption rate during secondary metabolism has been shown to be ten times lower in an agitated culture of WRF than that observed under static conditions (Ulmer et 
al., 1983). This indicates that the maint enance coefficient, and hence glucose feeding 
required, depends on operating conditions. Lignolytic activity of WRF is associated with 
polysaccharide formation, which hydrolyses in the acidic culture conditions of T. 
pubescens , creating another potential carbon source, a further indication that some 
other easily utilisable carbon source is required in small quantities for successful 
production of lignolytic enzymes.   
  
101All the effluent concentrations used resulted  in an initial increase in laccase production 
relative to the control. The most pronounced effect was observed for 2% v/v effluent, 
with a maximum activity of 11.8 U/mL being reached after 9 days (Fig 5.7).

effluent to a fermentation of T. pubescens  in an ALR 
 
Two interesting physiological phenomena were observed on addition of effluent to the 
ALR cultures of T. pubescens. Immediately (within 5 min) after addition of an aliquot of 
effluent (2 % v/v), there was an increase in laccase activity in the culture medium and the effect became more pronounced over successive additions (Fig 5.8). It was not 
sustained, however, and the peak disappeared in 2-3 hours. In one instance, the laccase 
activity spiked up to 70 U/mL immediately following the 4
th addition of a 2% slug of 
effluent, and up to 50 U/mL in the 5% reactor.  There was no sudden large increase in protein in the culture fluid, as measured by the Bradford’s dye binding assay. This is not 
entirely surprising as increases in laccase activity are almost undetectable in terms of increase in total protein, but it does indicate th at it is unlikely that the increase in laccase 
activity is due to cell lysis, in which case a large, measurable release of cellular protein would occur.  This suggests some sort of adaptation by the culture where there is 
storage of laccase taking place in vesicles or vacuoles, which is then released as 
required.

At the conclusion of this set of ALR fermentations a decreased pellet density was 
observed in the culture fluid from the reactors to which higher concentrations of effluent 
had been added. Inspection of the respective fermenters showed large numbers of pellets attached to the walls of the vessel and to the draught tube, and the relative 
amounts were quantified as ‘suspended’ and ‘attached’ biomass (Fig 5.9). A proportionate decrease of suspended biomass with increasing effluent concentration (R
2 
= 0.96) was observed. There was hardly any difference in total biomass, however, with 
the lowest biomass concentration, 4.55 g/L for the 5 % v/v ALR, constituting   85 % of 
that of the highest (5.4 g/L) recorded fo r the control. Immobilisation affects the 
physiology of microorganisms and has in many cases been linked to increased enzyme 
production in fungi. 
 
Immobilised organisms are known to be more resilient to environmental stress compared 
to free cells. These factors seem to indicate that in an optimised bioremediation process intended for high pollutant concentrations, better results might be obtained by providing 
some sort of support matrix inside the reac tor. This will, however limit the chief 
advantage of fungal growth in an ALR, namely effective oxygen transfer.

5.4 Conclusions 
 
 The ALR system proposed in this study has been shown to provide a suitable 
environment for the successful growth (1 0 g/L) of the laccase hyper-secreting 
fungus (12 U/mL), T. pubescens.   
  The application of WRF in large-scale waste treatment has been impeded by 
lack of bioreactor systems yielding consistent production of lignolytic enzymes 
and controlled growth of fungi (Zhang et al., 1999).  
 
 The aeration supplied to an ALR, which provides control of both the agitation 
and OTR in the reactor, was optimised to achieve sufficient oxygenation and 
mixing while avoiding surplus supply, thus maintaining a suitable cost-benefit 
relationship.   
 
 Laccase activity levels were found to ou tperform those obtained in flask culture 
for both uninduced fermentations and those induced with phenolic effluent.  
  The management of aeration rate and the addition of inhibitory compounds 
(phenolic effluent) both have potentia l in controlling fungal growth.   
  
104CHAPTER 6 : REACTION CHARACTERISATION AND OPTIMISATION OF THE 
BIOREMEDIATION PROCESS 
 
6.1 Introduction 
Because of their biocidal nature most phenols cannot be satisfactorily treated by conventional biological wastewater treatment. The presence of phenols in high concentrations has the potential to irreversibly shock and damage live microbial systems (Kauffman et al.,  1999; Klibanov et al., 1980).  In order for the fungal system developed 
in this study to be applied in bioremediation, it would need to both survive and affect the removal the pollutant monomers from the effluent at concentrations much higher than those already shown to be effective inducers of laccase activity.  This was investigated 
in this project, using flask and bioreactor culture systems. 
 
It is important that degradation studies focus on realistic bioreactor operating conditions, 
and information on biodegradation mechanisms and kinetic data are required to allow an engineered reactor design (Pallerla and Chambers 1998). The ALR developed here was 
shown to be capable of biomass and laccase production by T. pubescens,  but these 
investigators had not demonstrated degradation of pollutants. Royer et al., (1991) could 
not demonstrate a correlation between laccase activity and decolourisation of bleach 
plant effluents and concluded that laccase pr oduction did not reflect the detoxifying 
activity of fungal pellets of the Trametes  species used. This chapter reports the results of 
our investigation into the bioremediation using the Trametes ALR system.  
 
The oxidation of phenolic compounds and other environmental pollutants by Trametes 
produce quinones and further polymerised products, and some of the pollutants are 
converted to carbon dioxide. An intracellu lar heme-flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-
cofactored glycoprotein designated cellobiose dehydrogenase (CBH), donates electrons to an extremely wide range of substrates including semi-quinones, ortho - and para-
quinones, azo dyes, kraft lignins, Fe(III), MnO
2 and Mn(III) complexes (Roy et al ., 1996). 
The quinone, hydroquinone and catechol reaction products can again serve as substrates for the oxidative enzymes. This ubiquitous redox cycle of phenolic 
compounds includes intra- and extra-cellular processes and is not yet fully understood.  
The rapid intracellular metabolism of the quinone and hydroquinone intermediates is a possible mechanism for shifting the dynamic polymerisation/depolymerisation equilibrium towards degradation a nd mineralisation (Schlosser et al ., 1997).   This  
  
105chapter also reports a preliminary investigation conducted to confirm that the system 
could be applied to other authentic phenolic effluent streams.  
 
6.2 Methods 
 
6.2.1 Culture and growth conditions 
Trametes pubescens  (CBS 696.94) was maintained on 2% malt agar plates. The culture 
medium used contained 10g/L glucose and peptone and 2g/L KH 2PO 4. 
 
6.2.2 Inoculum preparation 
T. pubescens from plate culture was homogenized in growth medium and used to 
inoculate 300mL-sterilized medium in 2L Er lenmeyer flasks. Th ese flasks were 
incubated at 28 C and 175 rpm. The gyratory motion of the shaker promoted uniform 
pellet formation and this speed was found to produce small, dense pellets. Four-day-old 
pellets from these cultures were used as a reactor inoculum.   
6.2.3 Determination of laccase enzyme activity 
Laccase activities were determined by monitoring the oxidation of 2,2’-azinobis (3-
ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)  as the substrate (Wolfenden and Willson, 
1982). The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, 0.33 mL 5 
mM ABTS and 0.17 mL sample (Roy-Arcand et al. , 1991). Oxidation of ABTS was 
measured by determining the increase in absorbance of the mixture 420 nm (  = 36 000 
M
-1). One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to 
oxidise 1 mol of ABTS per min. 
 
6.2.4 HPLC analysis of phenolics 
Samples were aseptically drawn from the flasks, centrifuged and then filtered to remove any cell debris. The removal of the effluent components was monitored by HPLC (Merck 
LaChrom), utilising a Waters S5 (5 m), C
18 reverse phase column (250 x 4.6mm) with a 
mobile phase of water:acetonitrile 85:15 containing 1.66% w/v -cyclodextrin, to 
separate the cresol isomers.  
  
106 
6.2.5 ALR operation 
The concentric draught-tube internal loop airlift reactor used in this work was described 
in section 5.2.3. The reactor was filled with 3.15 L of growth medium and autoclaved. After cooling a 350mL (10%) inoculum was aseptically introduced and the air supply 
attached, initiating the fermentation. In the pollutant degradation experiments, a three-day initial growth period was allowed before any stripped gas liquor (SGL) effluent was 
added. Thereafter 2% v/v effluent was added daily to one reactor, 3.5% to a second and 5 % to a third.   
 
6.2.6 ALR Sampling 
5mL samples were aseptically drawn from the ALR and replaced with glucose-free 
growth medium. Samples were centrifuged to remove suspended biomass and glucose 
and laccase activity assays were performed on the supernatant. In the experiments 
where pollutants were added to the reactor, the air supply was terminated for 10 minutes 
to allow the biomass to settle and 100mL of cell-free culture medium withdrawn from the 
reactor. This volume was replaced with effluent appropriately diluted with growth 
medium. 
 6.3 Results  
 
6.3.1 Removal of phenols from effluents in flask reactions 
To quantify the removal of effluent phenolic monomers from solution, different 
concentrations of the effluent were added to flask cultures of T. versicolor  and samples 
were taken over time for HPLC analysis. The removal of the effluent monomers from 
solution in flask cultures with up to 20% v/v (15mM) concentration of effluent was 
successfully completed after 12h (Fig 6.1). The phenol proved to be more recalcitrant than the cresol ( o, m and p) isomers. This was not an unexpected result because the 
efficacy of laccase reactions in removing various phenolic substrates has been shown previously to depend on both substituent group and position of substitution. Shuttleworth 
and Bollag (1986) showed that at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (0.925 mM) nearly 100 % of all the cresols were removed, whereas only 10 % or less of the chlorophenols were 
transformed. The ability of the laccase to remove cresol was dependent on the position 
of the methyl group with meta-  substituted cresol being the least oxidised and para-   
  
107cresol the most. Interestingly, the authors found also that 2,6-dimethylphenol was a 
better laccase substrate than any of the cresols (based on total amount of transformed).

effluent by flask cultures of T. versicolor from 5 % vol/vol (A) and 20 % vol/vol (B) 
final concentrations 
 
To our knowledge the concentrations of the phenolic monomers removed by T. versicolor in this system are the highest reported to date (Table 6.1).  This is attributed to 
the optimised conditions developed in this study.   
 However, the removal of single doses of the target effluent monomers from flasks does not constitute an efficient bioremediation process, and the preliminary success shown 
here needed to be further developed into removal of multiple doses and eventually a 
(semi) continuous system, and this was achieved using the ALR bioreactors described earlier in this report.

It is difficult to compare the removal rates reported here with other studies. While there 
are numerous studies on the removal of organic pollutants using the enzymes of T. 
versicolor  there are very few that deal with whole cell degradation of phenolic effluents. 
Novotny et al. , (1997) reported a 50% removal of a 0.9 ppm concentration of a 
commercially available mixture of PCB’s, Delor 106, after 3 weeks incubation in static 
flasks of T. versicolor . This was the best removal out of the four WRF tested. Logan et 
al. (1994) found a removal of 6 mg PCP/L over a 12 day incubation period. The authors 
reported further that PCP removal in 250 mL flasks was greater in shallow (10 mL) 
cultures than in deep (50 mL) culture. This indicates that the ratio of surface area to volume of liquid media is an important factor in the extent of PCP (and possibly other 
phenolic compounds) removal by WRF. Interestingly, they also acknowledged that 
culture age prior to addition of PCP had an effect on its removal, but this was never quantified.  Collins and Dobson (1996) found a 50 % removal of 20 mg/L phenanthrene in 3 days in whole culture and Morgan et al.  (1991) reported a mineralisation rate of 2.8 
g/g dry weight/day for Dieldrin in flask culture. Based on comparisons with these results 
available from literature it appears that T. versicolor  is highly suitable to the removal of 
phenolic compounds from solution. Further, the system developed here is apparently superior to those reported previously. 
 6.3.2 Removal of phe nolic monomers from solution in the ALR 
Based on prior results in this study, the bioremediation capacity of T. pubescens in flask 
culture was shown to be successful, but these results needed to be extrapolated to a 
bioreactor system. After 4 days growth period 2.5 % (v/v) effluent was introduced into  
  
109the ALR, after 3 more days, another 5 % and 3 days later another 10 %. Samples were 
taken daily and assayed for residual phenols. The target monomers (phenol, p-cresol, 
m-cresol and o-cresol) were completely removed from sequential additions of effluent at 
increasing concentrations over a period of 8 d (Fig 6.2).

Although dephenolisation of the effluent is considered to be primarily due to the action of extracellular enzymes, there are reports on the involvement of intracellular enzymes in the detoxification/decolourisation process. Watanabe et al. (1982) showed that in the 
presence of a simple sugar and oxygen, sorbose oxidase, an intracellular enzyme in 
Coriolus (Trametes) versicolor contributed to the decolourisation of a distillery effluent. 
Royer et al. (1991) report the loss of activity of pellets of T. versicolor  in a packed bed 
upflow type reactor in repeat batch additions of a kraft effluent. No such loss of activity 
was evident in this study, where all the phenols being removed within one day of 
addition for all three additions (Fig 6.2). Swamy and Ramsay (1999) presented further evidence of the requirement of Trametes  cultures for a carbon co-substrate in long-term 
lignolytic/bioremediation activity. It was demonstrated by them that sequential dye 
decolourisation required adequate supplies of glucose, but that above a certain critical 
concentration, this rate was unaffected by increases in glucose levels. The requirement for glucose appeared to be associated with a rate-limiting step in the decolouration 
mechanism, rather than heightened metabolic activity. 
  
  
110To further establish the potential of a T. pubescens  bioremediation process, the ALR 
system was operated in a fed batch mode where effluent and glucose (0.5 g/L) were 
added daily to the reactor. A 5 % (v/v) effluent concentration was the highest tested and 
all target monomers were removed before the next addition (Fig 6.3).  In the only other 
report of Trametes  sp. grown in an ALR, the authors (Rancano et al., 2003) measured 
the performance of the fermentation in terms of laccase production. The decolourisation of the sulphonephthalein dye Phenol Red was investigated, but only in the extracellular fluid obtained from the reactor, not in situ . This does present an alternative treatment 
methodology, but removes the potential for the whole cell mineralisation of the target compounds and overlooks the role of the mediator systems produced by WRF that facilitate lignolysis and the degradation of xen obiotic compounds. This could explain the 
relatively poor results achieved by them, with a decolourisation of 34 % reached in 27 h.

The initial attack on aromatic compounds by WRF is made by the extracellular lignolytic 
enzymes performing a one-electron abstraction, thereby generating cation radicals of the contaminants. These radicals undergo spontaneous chemical reactions such as C-C 
cleavage or hydroxylation resulting in more  hydrophilic products (Hammel, 1995). Those 
products are taken up by the fungal cells and co-metabolised in the presence of a proper 
(easily utilisable) carbon source to carbon dioxide (Hammel et al. , 1991), still a complex 
process of oxidation, reduction, methylation and hydroxylation.   This presents further 
motivation to provide a constant supply of a readily utilisable carbon source to T.

phenols are shown in Table 6.2.

These results (Table 6.2) represent the highest total removal as well as rate of removal 
of toxic aromatic compounds from water by WRF yet reported. 
 
Other researchers have used bioreactors based on WRF to treat toxic aromatic 
compounds: Shim and Kawamoto (2002) utilised P. chrysosporium  in a packed bed 
system to remove PCP from solution at a rate of 0.06g/d for 20 days, an overall removal 
of 1.2 g achieved in an 8 L (solid substrate) reactor, i.e. double the size of the one used 
in this study. Pallerla and Chambers  (1997) developed a 0.6 L fluidised bed bioreactor 
utilising T. versicolor  immobilised in alginate beads to treat bleach plant effluents (2 % 
v/v) that achieved a colour reduction of 75 % and AOX reduction of 70 %. The same 
reactor was used to remove 0.01 gPCP/g biomass/day (Pallerla and Chambers, 1998). 
Mielgo et al.  (2001) developed a P. chrysosporium  based packed bed reactor that 
removed 0.2g/L/d of the azo-dye Orange II reliant on the production of MnP. 
 
6.3.3 Characterisation of reacti on products from bioremediation 
An investigation was conducted to characterise the changes in the pollutant substrates 
when treated with laccase from Trametes versicolor  and Trametes pubescens . The 
results showed that crude laccase extracts from Trametes versicolor and Trametes 
pubescens , and partially purified laccase from Trametes versicolor  would totally or 
partially convert a number of model pollutants in a synthetic effluent solution and in authentic industrial effluents.   The pollutants present in three local industrial effluents 
i.e. phenolic Black Product and cresylic (SGL) petrochemical effluent, and Pulp and  
  
112Paper effluent from a paper mill were  used. The crude la ccase extract, from Trametes 
versicolor , was used for the bioconversion of phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol and o-cresol. 
69.2% and 43.6% bioconversion of o-cresol and phenol occurred respectively, at 5mM 
concentrations.  
 Table 6.3 Initial concentration of phe nols present in the authentic effluents 
Effluent Pollutant Concentration (mM) 
Phenolic Black Product Phenol 4.28 
Cresylic Effluent Phenol 31  
 p-cresol 6.25 
 m-cresol 6.7 
 o-cresol 87.65 
Pulp and Paper Effluent Guaiacol 32.47 
 4-chlorophenol 5.01 
 
The percentage conversion of each pollutant in the pulp-and-paper waste was not dependent on the starting concentration, but 24.5% 5mM 2,4-dichlorophenol was 
converted after treatment with crude laccase extract. The laccase enzyme showed selectivity for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 4-chlorophenol at 5mM concentrations. The 
lower levels of conversion achieved in this study in comparison to the phenolic 
compounds in the petrochemical effluents, might be attributable to the methanol used to 
dissolve the insoluble chlorophenolic compounds,  which may have had a slight inhibitory 
effect on laccase enzyme.  The highest conversion of the pulp and paper pollutants 
appeared to be for 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, at 5mM 
concentrations.  The use of whole cell biomass was also investigated and compared to 
the results obtained for the free laccase enzyme. Trametes versicolor biomass, grown in 
TDM, were used to treat model pollutants found in the petrochemical and pulp and paper 
effluents. The whole cell system appeared to be an efficient method for the 
bioconversion of pollutants, catalysing 100% and 26.36 % conversion of o-cresol and m-
cresol respectively at a 5mM concentration. The Trametes versicolor  whole cell system 
did not necessarily offer a better alternative for the treatment of the pollutants, with 
respect to percentage conversion, than laccase enzyme, but whole cell systems do 
represent a more cost effective method of treating wastes. The selectivity in the treatment of pollutants present in the three industrial effluents was also considered. After 
treatment with crude laccase extract from Trametes pubescens , p-cresol and o-cresol  
  
113present in the cresylic SGL effluent had undergone 100% conversion and 98.5% 
conversion respectively. In the pulp-and-paper effluent, after treatment with  laccase 
from Trametes pubescens,  the guaiacol decreased by 65.9% and the 4-chlorophenol by 
14.3%. The laccase enzyme was thus effectively able to reduce the toxicity of the 
selected pollutants in both the effluents. This clearly demontrates the general 
applicability of the system.  
6.4. Further development of the ALR bioremediation system 
 
6.4.1 Investigation of physical design parameters (Pentech contribution) 
Initial experiments concentrated on mixing effects in a small reactor (63 mm diameter).   
Later work used a reactor of similar dimensions as that used at UCT.  A 63 mm diameter 500 mm deep vessel with a 32mm draft tube was set up.   An air flowrate of between 40 
ml/min  and 200 ml/min had been tried in this unit and the apparent mixing time 
recorded.  It did not vary significantly with  air flowrate as would be expected.   Values 
between 270 and 390 seconds were observed but with no repeatable relation to the air flowrates used. 
 
Table  6. 4 Air flow rate vs. mixing time in small airlift reactor

153 210 390 
166 240 270 
231 120 330 
 
It was concluded that in these experiments the delay in salt tracer reaching the active elements of the (occluded or “shrouded”) conductivity cells used probably accounted for 
most of the time delays observed and that the real mixing times were far shorter than the apparent values recorded.    Thus the results were discounted as being of little 
conclusive value.  These early experiments concentrated on the mixing effects but did 
not attempt to measure the oxygen transfer rates.   There was also no attempt to 
simulate the viscosity effects that would be pr esent in an operating fungal bioreactor.  It 
was expected that an optimum bubble size would be demonstrated.  Literature had  
  
114suggested that 2mm bubbles seemed to give the best mass transfer rates.  Bubbles this 
size were difficult to attain in the small reactor.  The type of home-made sparger 
(perforated plastic tube) employed could not  deliver regular bubble streams from the 
relatively large orifices used.   The aquarium pump employed could also not allow higher 
pressures and smaller sparger orifices to be employed. 
 A larger unit was desirable that would allow a larger air flow rate to be used and thus 
constructed in 2001.   A range of interchangeable single-orifice nozzles was selected so that the effect of pressure on the sparger di scharge and its air dispersion characteristics 
could be studied and varied.  A 160 mm diameter vessel was then constructed using 
funds allocated to Pentech from the project budget.   This unit could be varied in height 
from 500 mm to 2000 mm and greater, if desir ed, by bolting together flanged clear pvc 
sections each of 500 mm depth.   These segments were originally purchased for an ion 
exchange column in another project funded by NRF and re-allocated to the airlift reactor 
project.     
 
The draft tubes were of clear Perspex or pvc of five different (32; 50; 63; 75 and 90 mm) 
diameters.  Thus the draft tube could be varied in both diameter and height and its 
position above the base of the vessel and/or below the top liquid level could be adjusted by means of a plastic “spider” with rubber friction pads holding it in place..   The point of injection of air  was also variable relative to the base of the draft tube by moving a 
central air inlet tube that carried the nozzle and that was inserted through a gland at the 
base of the vessel.    
The air nozzles could be changed starting with single orifice nozzles or various types of frit.   The nozzles included a simple orifice plate (170microns hole); a slit and a circular 
orifice in two solid body jet type spray nozzles (used for water spray purposes) and a 
nozzle with a very fine “long” orifice (approx imately 2mm deep and 50 microns diameter) 
in the form of a readily available and i nexpensive (R10-00) “Cadac” cooker top gas 
nozzle, obtained form a local gas appliance store.  Domed ends of light gauge material were fitted at top and bottom for operation at 
atmospheric pressure only.   Heavy gauge clear Perspex spherical domed ends were later obtained from a fabricator that would allow the vessel to be operated under  
  
115pressures above atmospheric in order to test the effects on bubble size and oxygen 
mass transfer coefficient. 
 
6.4.2 Measurements on 160 mm diameter reactor 
Mixing effects could be monitored from a residence time between two conductivity probes and a salt injection “lance” that could be placed at different points to experiment 
with the dispersion of a salt tracer ahead of t he conductivity detectors.   Variable height 
conductivity cells were made up that could, similarly to the salt injection lance, be placed 
at different heights relative to the draft tube – diametrically and vertically. 
 The air flow rate in this unit could be alte red by adjusting a pressure regulator. And 
measured by reading a rotameter situated on the outlet.   Typical air rates obtainable 
were up to 600 ml/min at 1,5 bar inlet pressure (or higher if desired). 
 The mass transfer coefficient measurements were to be obtained by using a sodium 
sulphite solution catalyzed with cobalt to simulate a reactive organism “medium”.  The 
chemical reaction (reduction of oxygen by sulphite) would maintain a nearly zero 
concentration of oxygen in the liquid phase at a ll points in the reactor at all times during 
an experiment.   This would obviate the need to arrange a measurement of oxygen in continuous inlet and outlet liquid streams.  It would also avoid having to attempt live culture work that would have been expensive in terms of medium, disposal and probably 
impractical for us to perform at this stage.   The solution of sulphite would be introduced 
as a batch and as long as there remained unreacted sulphite it was expected that oxygen concentration in the solution phase could be assumed to be close to zero at all 
points.  
The mass transfer coefficient effect was to be derived from changes in the oxygen 
concentration in the air leaving the top of the unit.   Oxygen concentrations were 
measured by placing a DO probe in a small Buchner flask connected into the outlet gas stream.   The probe was calibrated in fresh air and the oxygen consumed was then 
deduced by a mass balance based on the air outlet volumetric flow rate measured on a rotameter.  The rotameter was calibrated using the standard displacement technique by 
means of an inverted 2 litre measuring cylinder.

6.5 Scale up of the ALR 
In the final stages of this project, a larg er scale ALR has been designed (Figure 6.4) and 
built, and although it was not an objective of this project to run the system at pilot scale, 
the larger scale bioreactor has been commissioned and will be used in further 
development of the bioremediation system sub sequent to completion of this project. 
 
6.6 Inclusion of a membrane separation unit  
The original plan for the reactor developed in the project included a membrane unit to 
separate or retain biomass within the reactor.  This was found to be unnecessary in the 
ALR, since the biomass is retained automatically within the reactor, and medium / 
reaction solution is removed by overflow without loss of biomass incurring.  This is an advantage, in fact, since it means that the considerable expense that would be incurred 
in including a membrane unit can be avoided.

119CHAPTER 7 : GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
 
The work described in this report represents a broad-based, interdisciplinary approach to 
the development of a fungal bioremediation pr ocess for the production of the lignolytic 
enzyme laccase, and the subsequent treatment of phenolic wastewaters of industrial 
origin.  
 
7.1 Key findings 
The major findings of this work can be summarised as follows: 
 7.1.1 Physiology of Trametes  strains with respect to bioremediation potential 
 The basidiomycetes Trametes versicolor  (PPRI 3845) and Trametes pubescens  
(CBS 696.94) have been shown to be outstanding producers of the oxidative 
enzyme laccase and ar e consequently resilient to the effects of aromatic 
compounds usually toxic to most other microorganisms. 
 The production of this enzyme was optim ised in static culture by the use of a 
carbon and nitrogen ‘sufficient’ growth medium; and further increased by the addition of various inducer compounds, including a ‘stripped gas liquor’ effluent.  
 The complex physiological response of T. versicolor to the addition of the 
phenolic effluent was illustrated and explained in terms of enzyme production, 
metabolic activity and morphological differentiation. Many of the deleterious 
effects of effluent addition can be ameliorated by cont rolling the amounts 
added, and the time of these additions relative to culture age. 
· The pollutant compounds induce the enzymes required for their catabolism 
 increasing their concentrations resulted in increased fungal biomass  and 
 addition of a readily utilisable carbon source (glucose) was shown to 
increase and prolong oxidative enzyme production, and hence the removal of the aromatic toxins from solution 
 Immobilised biofilm reactors in the form of a Transverse Flow Membrane 
Bioreactor and a Trickle Bed Reactor were identified as suitable for growth, 
enzyme production and phenolic removal by T. versicolor . 
 Control of aeration rate was shown to optimise the fermentation performance 
for growth of Trametes species in an Airlift Loop Reactor and this system was 
found to outperform the other reactors investigated in terms of laccase 
production and the bioremediation of phenolic compounds.  
  
120 The Growth Related Productivity of 1.46 units of laccase produced per day per 
g biomass in the airlift bioreactor, u nder optimised conditions, represents a 33-
fold  improvement in laccase production  over the initial levels obtained in 
flasks  
 
 
 
 
 
7.1.2 Bioreactors for application of Trametes   strains in bioremediation 
 Control of aeration rate was shown to optimise the fermentation performance 
for growth of Trametes species in the Airlift Loop Reactor and this system was 
found to outperform the other reactors  investigated in terms of laccase 
production and the bioremediation of phenolic compounds. The ALR design has 
been scaled up to 100L 
 ALRs are well suited to wastewater treatment and have been shown in this 
study to be additionally suited to the growth of Trametes pubescens . Improvements in laccase production with Trametes Flask production Airlift reactor Optimised reactor 20 g/L biomass

121 The combination of the reactor configuration developed here and the efficiency 
of T. pubescens in the degradation of the phenolic compounds form the basis of 
an important, novel bioremediation process. 
 The study has shown the potential for providing a practical, cost-effective 
bioremediation process. 
 Complete removal of phenols in the ALR was achieved over extended operation 
times.  
 A total of 14 g mixed phenolics was removed over 16 days in a 3.5L airlift 
reactor.  
 These results represent the highest tota l removal and rate of removal of toxic 
phenols by WRF yet reported.  
 7.1.3 Usefulness of this bioremediation system 
 The combination of the reactor configuration developed here and the proven 
efficacy of T. pubescens in the degradation of certain phenolic compounds form 
the basis of an important, novel bioremediation process. 
 The evaluation of waste treatment procedures is no longer based solely on the 
reduction of gross indicators (e.g. BOD and COD); there is an increased emphasis on the removal of specific pollutants from waste mixtures. The 
development of this Trametes based treatment technology represents a 
departure from the traditional mixed culture biological processes commonly 
used to decrease the toxicity of industrial wastewater: here, a monoculture was 
used consistently reduce a range of compounds to low levels or, in most cases, completely remove them from solution.  
 
7.2 Implications of the research carried out in this study 
To achieve success using a biocatalyst it is necessary to clearly define both the market 
need, in a properly focused and quantified form, and the performance criteria required of 
the biocatalyst. Unlike other applications (e.g. the pharmaceutical industry), bioremediation does not result in the production of high value-added products. Thus, 
venture capital has been slow to invest in the technology and as a consequence, commercial activity in research and development has lagged far behind other industrial 
sectors involving bioprocesses. However, heightened environmental awareness has 
prompted regulatory organisations to assign economic value to environmental factors,  
  
122making by-product recovery and effective waste disposal part of standard industrial 
practice. With the worldwide market now estimated at $50 billion, there are clearly 
tremendous opportunities available for biorem ediation technologies and practitioners. 
The bioprocess developed in this study fulfils, at least in part, the wastewater treatment 
needs of various petrochemical industries.    
 For a bioremediation process to be successful, the bioremediation methods depend on 
having the right microbes in the right pla ce with the right environmental factors for 
degradation to occur. Both of the Trametes species tested in this work were 
demonstrated to have the phys iological and metabo lic capabilities to grow successfully 
in the presence of, and to degrade, the target pollutants. Many researchers have argued against these fungi utilising the aromatic po llutant compounds investigated in primary 
metabolism. This study has demonstrated that these compounds induce the enzymes 
required for their catabolism, and increasing their concentrations resulted in increased 
fungal biomass; thus, at  least partially, fulfilling the definition of primary metabolism. It 
must be noted however that the addition of a readily utilisable carbon source (glucose) was shown to increase and prolong oxidat ive enzyme production, and hence the 
removal of the aromatic toxins from solution, indicating a co-metabolic role.   
Bioreactors are used extensively in bioremed iation and their roles in the aerobic and 
anaerobic treatments of solid, slurry and liqu id wastes are already well established. Due 
to their low capital and maintenance costs, AL Rs are well suited to wastewater treatment 
and have been shown in this study to be additionally suited to the growth of Trametes pubescens .    
 
The evaluation of waste treatment procedures is no longer based solely on the reduction 
of gross indicators (e.g. BOD and COD); there is an increased emphasis on the removal 
of specific pollutants from waste mixtures. Selective removal of toxic compounds may be 
required to meet regulatory requirements or to facilitate subsequ ent treatment. The 
development of this Trametes  based treatment technology represents a departure from 
the traditional mixed culture biological processes commonly used to decrease the 
toxicity of industrial wastewater: in this instance a monoculture was able to consistently 
reduce a range of compounds to low levels or, in most cases, completely remove them from solution.   
  
1237.3 Further development 
While this report shows that the objective s of the project as proposed were achieved, it 
would be valuable and meaningful to take the system to larger scale and demonstrate its 
effectiveness at pilot scale.  Unfortunately this was beyond the scope of this project, and although much effort was put into attracting support from the relevant large-scale 
industrial company (who were kept informed about the research as it progressed), the support was not forthcoming.   
 
7.4 Recommendations 
 It is a strong recommendation of the research team that piloting of the airlift 
bioreactor system  should be carried out.   
 A link should be made with the research currently being conducted in project 
K5/1361 where bioremediation of agricultur al wastes is leading to beneficiation 
of the phenolics in the waste.  The bioreactor system  developed here can be 
extended to enhance the economic value of the beneficiation process.  
 There is a significant opportunity for international development of this research.  
Collaboration with researchers at the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Sydney is currently being investigated as a route to achieve this. 
This has enormous potential in terms of international extension of the research 
already achieved, since researchers in this institution have expertise and 
interest in both bioremediation and pr ocess modelling It is  recommended that
