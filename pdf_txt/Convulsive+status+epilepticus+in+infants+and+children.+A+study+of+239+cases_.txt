Status Epilepticus in Children 
J.Y. Yager, M. Cheang and S.S. Seshia 
ABSTRACT: We have prospectively reviewed the data on 52 children who presented with status epilepticus. Thirty-
four (65%) of the 52 had not had seizures before. Children who were previously abnormal were more likely to present 
with partial status epilepticus or to have seizures > 60 minutes than those who were previously normal. The median 
age (24 months) of those who presented with status epilepticus was the same as that of children with seizures of shorter 
duration. The causes were equally distributed among the idiopathic, acute encephalopathic and chronic encephalo­pathy groups. Three children died and 13 (28%) were left with neurological sequelae. The outcome was favorable for those in the idiopathic category. 
RESUME: L'etat de mal epileptique chez les enfants Nous avons revu de facon prospective les donnees recueillies sur 52 enfants qui consultaient pour un etat de mal epileptique. Trente-quatre (65%) des 52 enfants n'avaient jamais fait de convulsions dans le passe. Les enfants qui n'etaient pas normaux anterieurement etaient plus susceptibles de 
presenter un etat de mal epileptique partiel ou d'avoir des convulsions dont la duree excede 60 minutes que ceux qui 
etaient normaux anterieurement. L'age median (24 mois) de ceux qui presentaient un etat de mal epileptique etait le meme que celui des enfants qui presentaient des convulsions de plus courte duree. L'etiologie se repartissait egalement comme suit: idiopathique, encephalopathie aigue et encephalopathie chronique. Trois enfants sont decedes et 13 (28%) ont presente des sequelles neurologiques. L'issue a ete favorable chez les enfants dont les convulsions etaient d'origine 
idiopathique.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a common problem in pediatric 
practice. There have been few population studies, and none 
from North America, concerned with the epidemiology and prognostic features of SE in children, since that of Aicardi and Chevrie in 1970.
1"3 Viani4 et al from Italy recently reviewed 68 
children but their study was restricted to those with febrile SE. 
Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment may have 
changed the course of epilepsies in children. We, therefore, pre­
sent our data on 52 children with SE. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Patients and Population 
The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg is the only tertiary care 
pediatric facility between Toronto and Saskatoon. It drains a population of over 1.5 million. The majority, if not all of the children with SE referred to the Hospital are seen by the 
Pediatric Neurology Service. We prospectively reviewed chil­
dren aged one month to eighteen years presenting with seizures to the Emergency Department of the Children's Hospital 
between May 1985 and December 1986. 
SE was defined as a seizure or series of seizures lasting at 
least 30 minutes without consciousness being regained.
56 
Seizures were classified according to the proposal of the International League Against Epilepsy (1981).
7 Statistical Methods8 
Stepwise Logistic Regression was used to identify clinical 
variables predictive of an abnormal outcome and to obtain a classification function of outcome. The level of significance 
was set at p = 0.05. The clinical variables included were (i) age, (ii) sex, (iii) seizure type, (iv) duration of SE, (v) etiology, (vi) 
presence or absence of fever, (vii) normal or abnormal develop­ment prior to the onset of SE, (viii) previous history of seizures, 
and (ix) the presence or absence of a family history of seizures. 
An abnormal outcome was defined as one in which there 
was (i) the occurrence of neurodevelopmental dysfunction or 
(ii) a deterioration of the state in a child with pre-existing abnormality, following the bout of SE. Patients whose neurolog­
ical state was abnormal prior to the SE but who showed no dete­
rioration were included in those with a normal (unchanged) out­
come. 
RESULTS 
Age and Sex 
Four hundred and twelve children presented with seizures. 
Fifty-two (12.6%) of them had SE. The median age for both 
groups (those with and those without SE) was two years. 
The female to male ratio was  1.7:1.0  for the SE group and 
0.8:1.0 for the remaining 360 children. Forty-six percent of the

52 children with SE presented before eighteen months of age 
and 61.5% prior to their third birthday. 
Seizure Data 
SE was the first ictal manifestation in 34 (65.4%) of the 52. 
Ten (19%) patients had previously experienced an episode of 
SE. 
Table I shows the distribution of seizure types in those with 
SE. Thirty (58%) had generalized seizures and twenty-two 
(42%) had partial seizures. Of the 30 with generalized seizures, the etiology was idio­
pathic in twelve (40%) and encephalopathic (twelve acute 
encephalopathic and six chronic encephalopathic) in 18 (60%). 
Thirteen (43%) of the thirty patients had status lasting greater 
than 60 minutes, and six (46%) of the thirteen patients were pre­
viously abnormal. 
The etiology was idiopathic in five (23%) of the 22 with par­
tial seizure SE and encephalopathic (seven acute encephalo­
pathic and ten chronic encephalopathic) in 17 (77%). Eleven 
(50%) of the twenty-two had status lasting longer than 60 min­
utes,  and seven (64%) of the eleven were previously abnormal. 
Ten of the 22 (45%) with partial SE had neurodevelopmental 
dysfunction prior to the episode as did 9 of the 30 (30%) who presented with generalized SE. 
Etiology 
Causative factors were grouped into idiopathic (no cause 
found) and "encephalopathic". The latter group was further sub­
divided into acute and chronic encephalopathic. Those patients 
with prolonged febrile seizures of undetermined etiology, were included in the idiopathic group. 
Cases were divided evenly between the idiopathic, acute 
encephalopathic and chronic encephalopathic groups. Details 
are outlined in Table 2. 
Three of the six patients with metabolic dysfunction had 
cerebral infarction, Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and meningitis 
respectively. In these children, the metabolic cause was felt to 
be primarily responsible for the S.E. 
The type of CNS malformations in our cases included con­
genital microcephaly (N = 2) and hemimegalencephaly, lissencephaly and Aicardi's syndrome (one each). Both children 
with neurodegenerative diseases had mitochondrial 
encephalomyelopathies. 
Outcome 
Forty-nine of the 52 children were followed for periods of I 
to 18 months. Three died; one child with hemimegalencephaly died of cardiorespiratory arrest following a two week episode of 
intractable SE. The second had a progressive neurological dis­
order and also died in cardiorespiratory arrest; she was found to 
have a mitochondrial encephalomyelopathy at necropsy. The 
third patient had idiopathic febrile SE and was found dead in 
bed at home; the brain was normal at necropsy. 
Thirteen (28%) of the 46 survivors had neurodevelopmental 
sequelae. Thirty of the forty-six were previously normal and 
nine (30%) of them developed sequelae. Four (25%) of the six­
teen patients who were previously abnormal experienced a dete­
rioration in their neurodevelopmental status. Only one child 
with idiopathic SE had neurodevelopmental sequelae. 
Sequelae in the nine previously normal patients included 
developmental delay in all, hemiplegia in 3 and epilepsy in 4. 
Neurological sequelae occurred in 60% of those patients pre­
senting before 6 months of age, 30% of those between 6 and 36 
months and 30% of those older than 3 years of age. 
Statistical relationship of variables to outcome 
Nine clinical variables (see methods) were included in the 
stepwise logistic regression procedure. Of these, only 3 entered 
the classification function of outcome (p < 0.03). The 3 vari­
ables were SE duration, past history of seizures and etiology.

The remaining 6 were "rejected" because they did not con­
tribute discriminatory information. The equation obtained was: 
Pr (abnormal outcome) = 1/(1 + exp - (-2.43 + 1.716 acute 
encephalopathy + 2.22 chronic encephalopathy -2.147 past 
history of seizures + 1.709 seizure length > 60 minutes) |. 
Treatment 
Diazepam or lorazepam was used at the outset and were fol­
lowed by phenobarbitone, phenytoin and valproic acid in vari­
ous combinations. Pentobarbital infusion was also used in one 
child with focal SE that did not respond to conventional treat­
ment. All drugs except valproic acid were given by the intra­
venous route and drug levels monitored. 
DISCUSSION 
SE is a common problem among children with seizures. 
Almost 13% of children presenting to us with seizures had SE, an incidence similar to that of Aicardi and Chevrie (1970)
1 and 
Fujiwara et al (1979).2 
The causes of SE were about evenly divided between idio­
pathic and (encephalopathic) symptomatic groups in other 
reports.128'9 Our own experience differs in that only '/3 of our 
cases were idiopathic. 
Infectious and metabolic etiologies were the most common 
causes in the acute encephalopathic group, an experience simi­
lar to that of Aicardi and Chevrie. Hypoxic ischemic 
encephalopathy, CNS malformations, post-infectious encephalopathy and degenerative CNS disease were the most 
common etiologies in the chronic encephalopathic group. 
SE was more common in those under 2 years of age but 
there was no difference in the median age of patients presenting with SE as compared to those with seizures of shorter duration. 
Patients who were previously abnormal were more likely to 
present with partial seizures or to have seizures lasting 60 or 
more minutes, than those who were previously normal. 
We used the stepwise logistic regression procedure, a multi­
variate method, rather than a univariate method, to minimize the effect caused by the inter-dependence of clinical variables. Three of the 9 clinical variables (see methods) entered the clas­
sification function equation. The probability of an abnormal 
outcome was increased with, (i) seizure length > 60 minutes 
(versus < 60 minutes), the odds ratio being 5.5 and (ii) 
encephalopathic (versus idiopathic) etiologies, with odds ratios of 5.6 and 9.2 for the acute and chronic encephalopathic groups 
respectively. On the other hand, the risk of an abnormal out­
come was reduced with a previous history of seizures, the odds ratio being 0.12. Previous (normal or abnormal) development 
was rejected from the final predictive equation. Thus, the effect 
of seizure length was independent of prior neurodevelopmental 
status.  The equation obtained and estimations presented are 
valid only for the present set of data and may not be applicable 
to other population sets. A larger data base from several centres 
may yield a predictive equation that could be applied with 
greater reliability. 
The mortality in children with SE has varied between 2% 
and 11% (Table 3). The mortality rate in our group was 6%. Twenty-eight percent of 46 survivors who have been followed 
developed neurodevelopmental dysfunction after the episode of 
SE but only one with idiopathic status had sequelae. Differences between (i) patient population, (ii) definition of SE, (iii) case 
groupings and (iv) length of follow-up likely contribute to the 
slight variations in our data, from those of others.
 >-2-9 
Our data and that in recent abstracts 9I0 suggest that the 
morbidity related to SE may be less than that previously report­ed, and that patients with idiopathic SE generally have a good 
outcome. But, despite advances in diagnostic methods and treat­ment, there has not been a substantial change in the clinical 
information on SE in children since Aicardi and Chevrie pub­lished their paper in 1970.
