In animal husbandary , copper (Cu) is used as feed additive  and pharmaceutical . 
The Cu is tranferred into manure  and distribute d on agricultural land.  Finally, the  
Cu from the manure  can accumulate  in agricultural soils. Although being a 
micronutrient, high Cu concentrations are toxic for microorganisms and 
invertebrates  and endanger the soil fertility . Former studies revealed Cu 
accumulations in Swiss agricultural soils in the past decades. However, these 
studies were not completely based on in -situ measured data. The aim of this 
study was to fill this gap and measure Cu fluxes at selected Swi ss agricultural 
sites. Specifically, the aim was  to trace Cu in the soil and to differentiate 
between anthropogenic and geogenic sources. Additionally, the metal 
distribution in Swiss agricultural systems was further elucidated, based on 
stable isotope ratios of system fluxes and soil pools.  
 
For that purpose, Cu balances of three grassland sites were determined by 
measuring the soil metal concentrations and all inputs (atmospheric bulk 
deposition, manure & parent material) and outpu ts (seepage water and grass 
harvest) during one hydrological year (May 2014 – May 2015). Furthermore, 
stable Cu isotope  compositions  of the soil and all inputs will be measured . 
 
Cu mass balances showed net accumulations at all three sites (25 -209 g ha-1 
yr-1) and man ure application was the most important flux (146-340 g ha-1 yr-1). 
Inputs with bulk deposition and through parent material weathering  were by 1 -2 
orders of magnitu de smaller. Beside the Cu  budgets, stable isotope data (not 
yet analysed) will be presented and discussed to assess the biogeochemical 
processes and redistribution of (anthropogenic) Cu in agricultural systems.
