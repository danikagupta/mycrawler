1. ABSTRACT
Alkylating agents have been use d to treat cancer
since the 1940s. Quinone-containing alkylating agents
represent a class of drugs called “bioreductive alkylating
agents.” These drugs require reduction of the quinone
moiety for activation of their alkylating substituents.
Despite active research in this area, mitomycin C is the
only bioreductive alkylating agent approved for general
use. The “enzyme-directed” approach to bioreductive drug
development involves identification of reductases which
are overexpressed in tumors when compared to uninvolved
tissues. Bioreductive drugs which are substrates for these
reductases should be selectively toxic to tumors with high
reductase levels. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
(NQO1, DT-diaphorase, EC 1.6.99.2) is a two-electron
reductase found primarily in the cytosol. NQO1 has
received considerable attention because of the high levels
of this enzyme in tumors particularly in tumors of the lung,
colon and breast. In this review, the current state of
research on quinone-containing alkylating agents is
discussed with the focus on NQO1-directed bioreductive
drug development. Recent structure-activity studies on
indolequinones, benzoquinones and other novel quinones
are reviewed, and the status of drugs which have been
studied in clinical trials is discussed. Finally, the limitations
and possible future directions in this research area are
presented.2. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY
Alkylating agents have been used in the treatment
of cancer since the first lymphosarcoma patient was treated
with nitrogen mustard in 1942 (1). One of the first
clinically effective nitrogen mustards, mechlorethamine, is
still used today in combination therapy for the treatment of
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (2). Other alkylating agents such as
cyclophosphamide and the nitrosoureas continue to play an
important role as key components of many combination
cancer chemotherapy regimens.
There are a number of quinone-containing
antitumor agents that are used clinically including the
anthracyclines - doxorubicin, daunorubicin and idarubicin -
and the anthracenedione, mitoxantrone. These agents bind
DNA in a non-covalent manner, and thus they are not
considered alkylating agents. The mitomycins from
Streptomyces  sp. are quinone-containing alkylating agents,
but only mitomycin C is currently approved for general use.
Many mitomycin analogs have been synthesized and
studied preclinically over the years, and a few have been
tested in clinical situations. Another quinone-containing
alkylating agent, the indolequinone EO9, which was
modeled after mitomycin C, has undergone clinical trials in
Europe under the direction of the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). There has
also been much interest in aziridinyl benzoquinones asNQO1-Directed Drug Development
640potential alkylating agents. One of these, diaziquone
(AZQ), has been part of a number of clinical trials. As an
investigational treatment for primary brain malignancies,
AZQ was selected as the first “orphan drug” by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the early
1980s.
In this revi ew, the rationale for the use of
quinone-containing alkylating agents, including the origin
of the terms “bioreductive alkylation” and “enzyme-
directed bioreductive drug development” will be discussed.
The current status of quinone-containing alkylating agents
in clinical use, clinical trials and preclinical studies will be
presented along with a discussion of strategies for drug
design based on chemical structures and the properties of
the various bioreductive enzymes. Finally, the limitations
of the bioreductive approach in the design of quinone-
containing alkylating agents and future directions for
research will be discussed.
2.1. Bioreductive activation
In anticancer drug design, the goal is to develop
drugs which are selectively toxic to tumor cells with
minimal toxicity to normal cells. The concept of
bioreductive drug activation was based on the premise that
hypoxic cells near the necrotic cores of solid tumors should
have a greater potential for reductive metabolism than
aerobic cells (3). The hypothesis was that drugs requiring
reductive activation to become cytotoxic would selectively
kill hypoxic cells while regeneration of the less toxic
“prodrug” would occur via redox cycling in well-
oxygenated cells. Although redox cycling leads to
generation of reactive oxygen species, cellular defenses
such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione
peroxidase generally limit their toxicity.
The term “bioreductive alkylating agent” was
first used by Sartorelli and coworkers (3), and it refers to
drugs which generate electrophilic species upon reduction
which then bind covalently to cellular macromolecules (4).
Intracellular activation of bioreductive alkylating agents
requires enzymatic reduction and can be accomplished by
both one- and two-electron reductases.  The result of
bioactivation is the production of both mono- and
bifunctional alkylating species (bifunctional alkylating
agents can cross-link DNA) and/or generation of reactive
oxygen species. Bioreductive alkylating agents include
quinone-containing alkylating agents such as mitomycin C,
and it is these compounds which are the focus of this
review.
2.2. Enzyme-directed bioreductive drug development
Another approach to achieving selective toxicity
through bioreductive activation is to identify reductase
enzymes which are overexpressed in tumor cells when
compared to normal cells. This “enzyme-directed”
approach was first proposed by Workman and Walton (5),
and the principal elements of enzyme-directed bioreductive
drug development have been detailed (6). One element
involves the identification of compounds which are
substrates for and bioactivated by a particular reductase.
Much work has been done on structure-based drug designfor specific reductases, and this work will be described in
detail later in this review. A second element suggests the
need for enzyme profiling for patients to document that the
selected reductase is elevated in the targeted tumor (6).
The two-electron reductase, NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase (NQO1, DT-diaphorase, EC 1.6.99.2), has
received considerable attention in the area of enzyme-
directed bioreductive drug development. Markedly elevated
levels of this enzyme have been reported in a range of
tumor types, and the role of NQO1 in the activation of
quinone-containing alkylating agents has been documented
(7-9). Other reductase enzymes have also been identified as
activators of quinone-containing alkylating agents. They
include NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (P450R, EC
1.6.2.4), NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R, EC
1.6.2.2), xanthine oxidase (XO, EC 1.2.3.2) and xanthine
dehydrogenase (XDH, EC 1.1.1.204) among others.
Evidence for the role of each of these reductases in
bioreductive drug activation will be discussed later in this
review. A comprehensive analysis of the many factors
which contribute to the activation of quinone-containing
alkylating agents - including the relative importance of
reductase activity, pH, oxygen tension and other
microenvironmental factors - is beyond the scope of this
review. Several recent reviews have been published which
include discussions on this issue (8-10).
2.3. Clinical agents
Discovery of novel quinone-containing alkylating
agents and their subsequent development as anticancer drugs
has been an active area of research for many years. Since
the isolation of the mitomycins from Streptomyces sp. in
the late 1950s (11), their structure has formed the
foundation for the synthesis of hundreds of analogs. For
many of these, the basic structure of the mitomycins has
been retained,  but for many others a more simplified
indolequinone framework has been used. Other research
groups have focused on the development of benzoquinone
alkylating agents, and some work has been done with
benzimidazolequinones. Several analogs of mitomycin C
have been studied in a clinical trial in the U.S., Europe or
Japan (12-15) along with the indolequinone EO9 (16) and
the benzoquinone diaziquone (AZQ) (17,18). Examples of
indolequinone and benzoquinone alkylating agents which
have been approved for use or evaluated in clinical trials
are shown in Figure 1.
2.3.1. Mitomycin C and its analogs
Mitomycin C is considered the prototype
bioreductive drug (19). It is the only quinone-containing
alkylating agent that is approved for general use. Mitomycin C
has shown activity against tumors of the stomach, pancreas,
colon and breast (20). It has been used clinically with success
in combination therapy (20) and has been called the most
active single agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer (21). It has also been used as a local treatment for
papillary cancer of the bladder (2). Mitomycin C is a very toxic
drug (2), and its principal toxicity, bone marrow suppression, is
related to the total cumulative dose (20). The search for active
analogs of  mitomycin C has been due, at least in part, to its
high toxicity.NQO1-Directed Drug Development

Figure  1. Clinical agents
As of the late 1980s, there had been more than
600 mitomycin derivatives involved in some kind of
preclinical testing (13). Several compounds have made it to
early clinical trials, but none have been approved for use.
KW-2149 (7- N-[2-(gamma-L-glutamylamino) ethyldithioethyl]
mitomycin C, which appears to be activated by non-protein
thiols rather than bioreductive enzymes, has undergone
phase I studies (15). Unfortunately, serious pulmonary
toxicity developed (22,23), and this effect was not
suppressed by pretreatment with steroids (23). BMS-
181174 (previously known as BMY 25067; 7- N-[2-(4-
nitrophenyl)dithioethyl]mitomycin C) was also examined
in a phase I trial (24). No further trials were planned with
this compound due to pneumonitis, thrombophlebitis and
other serious toxicities (24). Porfiromycin ( N-
methylmitomycin C) was studied clinically in the 1970s
(25) and most recently was the subject of a phase III trial
for treatment of head and neck cancer in combination with
radiation therapy (26). Results from the latter study showed
that porfiromycin had acceptable toxicity and encouraging
efficacy, but the study was still ongoing (26). Another
mitomycin C analog, KW-2083 (7- N-[4-
hydroxyphenyl]mitomycin C) was investigated clinically in
Japan in the 1980s (27). In a phase II study, KW-2083 was
used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Only a
few partial responses were noted and pronounced
myelosuppression was a dose-limiting problem (27).
2.3.2. EO9
EO9 is a synthetic indolequinone which was
designed as an analog of mitomycin C. EO9 became a
candidate for clinical trials because of its excellent
performance in preclinical studies. It showed excellent
activity in solid tumor animal models, was effective against
hypoxic tumor cells and showed no significant bone
marrow toxicity in animal toxicology studies (28). EO9
was selected by the EORTC for clinical trials, and partial
responses were observed in phase I studies (29). However,
it showed no antitumor activity in phase II trials of breast,
colon, pancreatic and gastric cancer (16) and no activity
against non-small cell lung cancer in another phase II trial
(30). The reason for EO9’s failure in the clinic are
unknown, but several possibilities exist. First, it may bethat the trials were not designed to measure appropriate
endpoints for evaluation of bioreductive agents (31). The
second possibility relates to drug delivery to the tumor.
EO9 has a very short half-life and exhibits poor tissue
penetration (9). This apparent shortcoming (poor drug
delivery) may actually be an advantage for treatment of
bladder cancer by intravesical administration since
systemic toxicity would be minimized. EO9 is now being
considered for this application (32). Work is also
proceeding on analogs of EO9 and other indolequinones
with emphasis on retaining solid tumor and hypoxic cell
activity while improving drug delivery characteristics.
These studies will be discussed later.
2.3.3. Diaziquone (AZQ)
Diaziquone (AZQ) is an aziridinylbenzoquinone
which was designed for tumors of the central nervous
system (20,33) and has shown some activity against
primary malignant brain tumors (34). Myelotoxicity,
especially thrombocytopenia, was the primary toxicity in
this study (34), and this is generally the case with AZQ
(20). More recently in a phase II study, AZQ, mitoxantrone
and etoposide were evaluated in two-drug combinations in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (17). Based on some
promising results, combination therapy with AZQ and
mitoxantrone was selected as the focus for further testing
(17). At least two other aziridinylbenzoquinones, trenimon
(triaziquone) and carbazilquinone, have been studied
clinically in Europe and Japan (33). Development of new
aziridinylbenzoquinones has been an active area of research
and will be discussed in a later section.
3. NQO1-DIRECTED DRUG DEVELOPMENT
Enzyme-directed drug development involves the
identification of compounds which are substrates for and
bioactivated by a particular reductase. Much of the recent
work in this area has focused on NQO1 due to the high
levels of this enzyme in some tumors.
3.1. Properties of NQO1
The discovery of NQO1, known to many as DT-
diaphorase, was reported by Ernster and Navazio in 1958
(35). NQO1 is a flavoenzyme; a cytosolic (>90%), two-
electron reductase that is characterized by its capacity for
utilizing either NADH or NADPH as reducing cofactors
and by its inhibition by dicumarol (36). NQO1 is usually
categorized as a detoxification enzyme, and it can protect
the cell from a broad range of chemically reactive
metabolites (37). NQO1 reduces quinones to
hydroquinones bypassing the potentially toxic semiquinone
radical intermediates (38,39). Not all hydroquinones are
redox-stable, however. Redox-labile hydroquinones can
react with molecular oxygen to form semiquinones and
generate reactive oxygen species, or semiquinones can be
generated via comproportionation reactions (40). The dual
role of NQO1 as both a prooxidant and antioxidant enzyme
in quinone metabolism has been comprehensively reviewed
(40).
Reduction by NQO1 can lead to bioreductive
activation of the quinone-containing alkylating agents.
Among the compounds that can be activated by NQO1 areNQO1-Directed Drug Development
642the clinical agents discussed in the previous section;
mitomycin C (41), AZQ (42) and EO9 (43). Correlations
between NQO1 activity and cytotoxicity of antitumor
quinones have been reported for tumor cell lines from a
range of tissues including breast, lung, colon, CNS and
ovary (44-46). A comprehensive study using the NCI’s
panel of 69 tumor cell lines compared enzyme levels of
NQO1, P450R and b5R with sensitivity to mitomycin C
and EO9 (47). NQO1 levels significantly correlated with
drug sensitivity, and in general, NQO1 was expressed at
higher levels relative to the other reductive enzymes
measured (47).
NQO1 can be induced by 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (48). Induction by procarcinogens
and the capacity of NQO1 for detoxifying reactive
metabolites suggest that changes in expression of NQO1
are likely to occur during carcinogenesis. Elevations in
NQO1 activity and gene expression have been documented
in both preneoplastic tissues and established tumors.
Tumors in which above normal NQO1 expression has been
observed include those from the lung, liver, breast and
colon (49-52). In addition, one recent study demonstrated
that expression of NQO1 increased with malignant
progression in colon cancer (53). The high levels of NQO1
in certain tumor types and the potential activation of
quinone-containing alkylating agents by NQO1 has
prompted an active search for compounds that can be
efficiently bioactivated by NQO1.
3.2. Structure-based drug design
NQO1 catalyzes the reduction of a broa d range of
substrates including p-quinones, o-quinones, quinone
epoxides, glutathionyl quinones, aromatic nitro compounds,
conjugated dialdehydes, quinone imines and azo dyes (36).
For this reason, it has historically been problematic to
identify those compounds which are the most efficient
substrates for NQO1. There have been a number of
attempts to identify key characteristics of antitumor
quinones that are required for metabolic activation, but
defining a single variable that ultimately leads to a potential
clinical agent has remained elusive.  It is known that
chemical reduction potential and in vitro substrate
specificity do not correlate for naphthoquinones (54),
aziridinylbenzoquinones (55) or indolequinones (56,57). In
the naphthoquinone paper, rates of reduction by NQO1 did
not correlate with octanol-water partition coefficients
which further limits the ability to predict substrate
specificity for NQO1 (54).
The relationship between enzyme activation and
toxicity is a complex issue. Values for substrate specificity
derived from cell-free metabolism systems have generally
been useful as a first estimate for screening new
compounds. Metabolism by NQO1 appears to correlate
loosely with toxicity to NQO1-containing cells, and this
has been shown in structure activity studies for
aziridinylbenzoquinones (55) and indolequinones (56).
Ultimately, toxicity to the cell is likely influenced by thenature of the toxic metabolite that is generated and
microenvironmental factors such as pH and oxygen tension.
3.2.1. Indolequinones
Indolequinones, mitosenes and
cyclopropamitosenes have been the most popular structures
for NQO1-directed anticancer drug discovery (Figure  2).
Based on the structures of mitomycin C and EO9, many
analogs have been synthesized, characterized and tested in
in vitro  metabolism and toxicity systems.
Mitomycin C is a poor substrate for NQO1
(44,58), and metabolism is pH dependent (59) due to pH-
dependent inactivation of NQO1 by reduced mitomycin C
(60). We have suggested that the presence of a leaving
group at the indole-3-position (9-position in mitosene
numbering system) - mitomycin C has a carbamate leaving
group at this position - may lead to generation of a reactive
electrophile which could alkylate the enzyme (56).
Indolequinones and mitosenes with carbamate or acetate
leaving groups at this position were not reduced by NQO1,
and NADH-dependent inactivation of NQO1 was observed
for these same compounds (56). These observations were
confirmed by Phillips and coworkers in a later study (61).
Interestingly, Naylor et al.  determined that leaving group
elimination at the indole-3-position occurred predominantly
from the hydroquinone (2-electron reduction product)
rather than the semiquinone (1-electron reduction product)
(62).
In contrast t o mitomycin C, EO9 is a good
substrate for NQO1 (44). Several structure-activity studies
have been published for compounds closely related to EO9
(57,61,63) and for indolequinones in general (56,61,64,65).
A common conclusion was that the presence of an aziridine
or methylaziridine group at the indole-5-position was
consistently desirable in eliciting a toxic response
(56,57,61,63-65) and for achieving selective toxicity to
NQO1-rich cell lines (56,61). The 2-methyl group on the
aziridine ring decreases metabolism by NQO1 and toxicity
to aerobic cells relative to aziridine alone (56,61), but
interestingly, it increases selectivity against hypoxic cells
by more than 10-fold (65). An hydroxymethyl group at the
indole-3-position appears to optimize the potency and
selectivity gained from the 5-aziridine or 5-methylaziridine
substituents (56,57). As an example, 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-3-
hydroxymethyl-1,2-dimethylindole-4,7-dione was over
500-fold more toxic to the NQO1-rich H460 non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line than to the NQO1-deficient
H596 NSCLC cell line (56). Some modifications have also
been made at the indole-2-position. Substituting phenyl for
methyl at this position has produced mixed results for
substrate specificity (56,61), but the 2-methyl derivative is
substantially more selective to NQO1-rich cells than the 2-
phenyl derivative (56,61).
3.2.2. Benzoquinones
AZQ is a benzoquinone and is reduced by NQO1
(58). In studies of analogs of AZQ, several
aziridinylbenzoquinones were found to be better substrates
for NQO1 than AZQ (55). One of these (MeDZQ, Figure  3)
was an excellent substrate for NQO1 (44,58) was 100-NQO1-Directed Drug Development

fold more toxic to the NQO1-rich HT-29 colon carcinoma
cell line than AZQ (55), and required enzymatic activation
by NQO1 in order to generate DNA cross-links (66). In two
studies comparing MeDZQ toxicity in NQO1-deficient cell
lines which had been transfected with human NQO1
cDNA, MeDZQ was four-fold more toxic to NQO1-
transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells than to
parental CHO cells (67) and seven-fold more toxic to
NQO1-transfected BE human colon carcinoma cells than to
parental BE cells (68).
Despite these impressive numbers, MeDZQ has
potential formulation problems due to its low solubility. To
address this, a water soluble analogue (RH1, Figure  3) has
been prepared and is currently under consideration for
clinical trials by the National Cancer Institute and Cancer
Research Campaign (69). RH1 demonstrated increased
metabolism by purified recombinant human NQO1
compared to MeDZQ, and it was more selective against
NSCLC and colon cancer cell lines overexpressing NQO1
compared to NQO1 null cell lines (68). RH1 was also 17-
fold more toxic to the NQO1-transfected BE cell line
compared to parental BE cells which do not express NQO1
(68). RH1 had a short plasma half-life in mice (t 1/2alpha =
4.8 min, beta = 9.6 min) (70), but due to its highly toxic
nature in cell culture (68) the levels of drug that are
achieved are expected to be sufficient to exert a toxic
response in target tissues. In support of this, RH1 was
observed to confer significant antitumor efficacy in three of
four human lung tumor xenograft models using
conventional intraperitoneal bolus daily treatments (71).
Subsequent testing in one of these models and in one
human ovarian tumor model revealed that continuous
infusions of RH1 conferred greater efficacy and reduced
the potential for drug-related toxicity (71).A series of benzoqui none mustards has also been
synthesized and tested for their ability to be activated by
NQO1 and their toxicity to SK-MEL-28 human melanoma
cells (72). This structure-activity study showed that the
nature of the substituents on the benzoquinone ring affected
both metabolism by NQO1 and cytotoxicity, but the results
were complicated by the formation of a cyclic intermediate
in some cases (72).
3.2.3. Other novel quinones
Although the indolequinones and benzoquinones
have been the most studied structures for development of
quinone-containing alkylating agents, other heterocyclic
quinones have been proposed as substrates for NQO1.
Skibo and coworkers have studied a range of pyrrolo[1,2-
a]benzimidazolequinones (PBIs) which are substrates for
NQO1 (Figure 4) (73). They demonstrated both the
activation and detoxification properties of NQO1. Non-
alkylating PBIs which are inhibitors of topoisomerase II in
the quinone form are inactivated by NQO1. Conversely,
alkylating PBIs are reductively activated by NQO1 (73).
Further studies with selected alkylating PBIs showed very
good in vivo  activity in the NCI hollow fiber tumor assay
(74).
There has also been some interest in quinolinequinones as
the basic structure for development of quinone-containing
alkylating agents (Figure 4) (75). Quinolinequinones are
generally much better substrates for NQO1 than analogous
indolequinones (75).
3.3. NQO1 crystal structure
Resolution of the three-dimensional structure of
rat NQO1 was reported in 1995 (76), and the structure of
human NQO1 has recently been resolved to 2.3 angstroms
(77) and 1.7 angstroms (78). Molecular modeling studies
based on these structures will be important for the design of
novel quinone-containing alkylating agents.
3.4. NQO1 polymorphism
A C to T base change at position 609 of human
NQO1 cDNA results in a loss of NQO1 enzymatic activity
(79,80). The incidence of this polymorphism ranges from
4% to 22% depending on ethnicity of the sample (81).
Obviously, this becomes important for NQO1-directed
chemotherapy with quinone-containing alkylating agents.
Genotype-phenotype characterization of this polymorphism
in individuals is accomplished most conveniently by
analysis of blood and saliva samples (81). Ideally, a tumor
biopsy sample would also be taken for enzyme profiling
prior to initiation of drug treatment with quinone-
containing alkylating agents.
3.5. NQO1 induction
Another approach to NQO1-directed cancer
chemotherapy involves the use of an inducer of NQO1 to
increase NQO1 activity in the target tumor. Begleiter et al.
used 1,2-dithiole-3-thione to increase NQO1 activity in
murine lymphoma cells. Exposure to 1,2-dithiole-3-thione
did not increase NQO1 activity in normal mouse boneNQO1-Directed Drug Development
644marrow cells. Toxicities of mitomycin C and EO9 to the
tumor cells were enhanced after exposure to 1,2-dithiole-3-
thione with no corresponding increase in toxicity of
mitomycin C to marrow cells and minimal increase in EO9
toxicity to marrow cells (82). In a subsequent study, similar
results were obtained using a panel of human tumor cell
lines (83).
4. OTHER BIOREDUCTIVE ENZYMES
It has been suggested that there should be two
distinct strategies for development of bioreductive drugs;
one which targets NQO1-rich aerobic cells and one which
targets NQO1-deficient hypoxic cells (9). There is ample
evidence supporting the involvement of bioreductive
enzymes other than NQO1 in the activation of quinone-
containing alkylating agents.
Apart from NQO1, cytochrome P450 reductase
(P450R) has probably received the most attention as a
target enzyme for activation of quinone-containing
alkylating agents. While it is clear that mitomycin C is a
substrate for P450R (84,85), no relationship between
P450R activity and chemosensitivity to mitomycin or EO9
was reported in the NCI tumor cell line study (47).
However, a study with P450R-transfected CHO cells did
show that the transfectants were 2-3-fold more sensitive to
mitomycin C than the wild-type CHO cells (86). In contrast
to what has been reported for NQO1, a recent study found
no significant differences in P450R activity in 17 lung and
18 breast tumor samples when compared to corresponding
normal tissues (87).
Other one- and two-electron reductases may also
play a role in the activation of quinone-containing
alkylating agents. Another one-electron reductase,
cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R), can also reduce mitomycin
C (88). Like P450R, b5R does not appear to be
overexpressed in tumors (89), and no relationship between
mitomycin C or EO9 chemosensitivity and b5R activity
was observed in the NCI tumor cell line study (47).
Xanthine oxidase (XO), acting as a one-electron reductase,
can bioactivate mitomycin C (84) and EO9 (90).
Mitomycin C can also be reduced by xanthine
dehydrogenase (XDH), and reduction is predominantly by
two electrons (91). Carbonyl reductase (CR) can catalyze
the reduction of a variety of quinone substrates (92), and it
was recently demonstrated that CR activity was increased
between 2- and 40-fold in lung tumor tissue when
compared to normal tissue (87). Finally, there have been
reports of unique cytosolic (93) and mitochondrial (94)
factors which are capable of metabolizing mitomycin C.
For the one electron reductases such as P450R
and b5R, the focus for bioreductive activation of quinone-
containing alkylating agents is on the hypoxic fraction of
tumors. In the NCI study, the chemosensitivity studies were
performed under aerobic conditions, and it was suggested
that the results may have been different had they been
carried out under hypoxia (47). If hypoxic tumor cells are
the target for selective toxicity, then the lack of evidence
for over-expression of enzymes such as P450R and b5R
may be irrelevant.5. PERSPECTIVE
Despite the very high level of research on the
design, synthesis and preclinical/clinical testing of quinone-
containing alkylating agents, mitomycin C remains the only
drug approved for general use as an anticancer agent.
Compounds that have seemed promising in preclinical
studies have either been too toxic or have been ineffective
in the clinic.
The use of  in vitro  assays to predict in vivo
efficacy has produced mixed results. Although one report
did demonstrate a relationship between NQO1 activity and
responsiveness to mitomycin C in human lung tumor
xenografts in athymic nude mice (50), other studies have
been less successful. Nishiyama et al.  showed an inverse
relationship between NQO1 activity and xenograft
responsiveness to mitomycin C (95). Cummings and
coworkers demonstrated no statistically significant
correlation between reductase activity (NQO1, P450R or
b5R) and antitumor activity of EO9, but mouse and human
tumor xenografts (two of each) were grouped together in
this study (96). Within each species, the data suggested that
there may be a relationship between NQO1 activity and
xenograft response (96), and this was also reported for
mitomycin C in the mouse tumor xenografts (97).
Mitomycin  C and EO9 metabolism data from these two
studies suggest that overall metabolic capability may be
more important than individual reductase activities (96,97).
In those cases where promising in vitro  studies
have failed to translate into in vivo  efficacy, there are a
number of possible explanations. Tumor heterogeneity is
certainly an important factor that cannot be duplicated
through the use of tumor cell line studies. Cells within
tumors will likely have different enzymology and
consequently variable abilities to activate quinone-
containing alkylating agents. Microenvironmental factors
such as pH, oxygen tension and blood flow can also vary
within a tumor, and these factors cannot be easily
duplicated in studies with cell lines.
Positive in vivo  animal data doesn’t necessarily
translate into success in the clinic. EO9 was very effective
in solid tumor xenografts, and it showed some selectivity
for tumors with high NQO1 activity (28). As indicated
earlier, however, EO9 failed to show activity in a range of
tumors in phase II clinical trials (16,30). The importance of
proper study design (31) and drug delivery considerations
(9) cannot be overemphasized since problems in these areas
may have contributed to the failure of EO9 in clinical trials.
Future work should continue to focus on
identification of novel quinone-containing alkylating
agents. Molecular modeling studies should benefit from the
recently resolved crystal structure of human NQO1 (77,78).
The experience with EO9 should lead to more drug
penetration and pharmacokinetic studies. Drug penetration
models such as those of Phillips et al.  (98) could be very
important for selecting promising compounds early in the
drug development process. Studies using animal models for
in vivo  efficacy and toxicology testing must continue to beNQO1-Directed Drug Development
645done despite their limitations. Finally, mechanistic studies
are essential to understanding how quinone-containing
alkylating agents cause damage to tumor cells. Knowledge
from these studies will provide insights into selectivity
mechanisms and facilitate development of more selective
and effective anticancer agents.
