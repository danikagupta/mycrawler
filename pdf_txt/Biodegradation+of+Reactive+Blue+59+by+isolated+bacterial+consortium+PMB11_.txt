Abstract: Azo dyes represents largest group and most versatile among synthetic dyes. Its Extensiveuse  in 
industries of paper, photography, dying, printing, cosmetics and their subsequent r elease in industrial effluents 
by traditional methods of treatment is causing serious environmental problems worlwide. In the present studies 
a mixed bacterial consortium (azo 8) was isolated from dye polluted soil from valsad and G.I.D.C., Vapi, 
Gujarat, India, by enrichment technique using Nutrient Broth/Agar and Bushnell and Haas Medium (BHM) 
incorporated with azo dyes Reactive Red 31 and Reactive Black 5.The consortium shows complete 
decolorization within 24 – 36 hours in static condition. The presence of laccase suggests its role in the 
degrdation of dyes. The biodegradation was monitored by TLC, HPLC and LC -MS. The results suggest that 
locally developed bacterial consortium azo 8 can be useful tool and must be exploited as bioremediation agents 
to redu ce dye pollutants.  
Keywords : Bacterial consortium, Reactive Azo Dyes, Biodegradation, Laccase, LC -MS. 
 
I. Introduction  
Textile dye wastewater has become one of the main reasons behind severe pollution problems due to 
the greater demand for textile products an d increase in production and application of synthetic dyes [1]. Azo 
dyes account for the majority of all textile dyestuffs produced and are the most commonly used synthetic dyes 
in the textile, food, paper making, color paper printing, leather and cosmetic  industries [2]. Dyes are broadly 
classified into several types. Based on the chemical structure of chromophoric group synthetic dyes are 
classified as azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, etc. These dyes have an adverse effect on the environment. The dyes 
are to xic and carcinogenic due to their high COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) values. Azo dyes are considered 
as electron deficient xenobiotic components because they possess azo (N=N) and sulphonic ( -SO3) electron 
withdrawing groups, generating electron deficiency and making the component less susceptible to oxidative 
catabolism by bacteria.  
Azo dyes are the largest group of dyes used in the textile industry [3]. The discharge of these 
sulfonated azo dyes has not only a negative aesthetic effect but also some azo dy es and their degradation 
products, sulfonated and unsulfonated aromatic amines are toxic or even carcinogenic [4]. Much of these 
studies have emphasized only the decolorization/degradation of dye wastewater, not discussing much about the 
metabolites releas ed by the cleavage of azo group. There is a need of novel mechanism for the removal of dyes 
from textile wastewater. Compared with chemical/physical methods, biological processes have received much 
more attentions due to cost effectiveness, lower sludge pr oduction and environmental friendliness [5], [6].  
Nowadays trends of using mixed microbial cultures known as consortium system as compared to 
individual strains as a treatment of dyes and dyestuffs. This consortium system for treatment possess higher 
degre e of biodegradation and ionization due to synergistic metabolic activities of microbial population and 
provide noticeable advantages over the individual pure culture in the degradation of textile dye stuffs[6], [7], 
[8]. The present study deals with a defi ned three bacterial strains, designated as consortium azo 8, was capable 
of degrading azo Reactive Red 31 and Reactive Black 5 under static condition. The dye degradation was studied 
by laccase activity and by TLC, HPLC and LC -MS analysis.  
 
II. Materials and M ethods  
2.1Samples  
Dye contaminated Soil samples were collected from Valsad and G.I.D.C., Vapi, Gujarat, (India) and 
kept in cold condition and used without any pretreatment.  
 
2.2 Dyes  
The textile azo dyes Reactive Red 31 and Reactive Black 5 dyes were proc ured from Atul Industries,

DOI: 10.9790/2402 -100403 3947                          www.iosrjournals.org                                                     40 | Page  2.3 Screening method of dye degrading bacteria  
Isolation of the microbial strains was carried out from the soil samples by enrichment culture technique 
using Nutrient broth/ Nutrient agar and Bushnell and Haas Medi um (BHM) containing 0.05 % Starch, 0.05 % 
Yeast extract and 100 ppm Reactive Red 31 and Reactive Black 5. Morphologically distinct bacterial strains 
showing decolorization on every successive transfer were selected for development of efficient bacterial 
consortium for azo dye decolorization.  
 
2.4 Decolorization studies  
All the decolorization experiments were performed in triplicates. Decolorization study of Rective Red 
31 and Reactive Black 5 were carried out by addition of 100 ppm of dye in 250 ml Erlenmey er flask containing 
100 ml of BHM medium containing 24 hr. old culture of all three bacterial isolates (mix consortium). All the 
studies were carried at Room Temperature and at pH 7. Samples (2 ml) were withdrawn after various time 
intervals to monitor dec olorization rate. Aliquots withdrawn were directly measured at 544 nm for Reactive Red 
31 and 597 nm for Reactive Black 5. The above mentioned protocol was followed for different studies viz. 
effect of shaking and static conditions, effect of increasing dy e concentrations on decolorization. The percentage 
decolorization was calculated [6] as follows:  
% Decolorization = Initial absorbance – Observed  absorbance × 100                                                         
Initial absorbance  
2.5 Identification of the Bacterial consortium  
A 16S rRNA analysis method was used to identify the selected bacterial strains. The nearly full -length 
16S RNA gene was amplified by PCR with forward primer 8F and reversed primer Universal 1492R. Purified 
PCR products were sequ enced using the ABI PRISM 3730XL Sequencer and the ABI PRISM BigDye 
Terminator Cycle Sequencing ready -reaction kit.  
 
2.6 Effect of Dye Concentration  
Various dye concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg /lit were added to BHM in order to examine 
the effec t of varying initial dye concentrations on decolorization.  
 
2.7 Effect of Shaking and Static condition  
Decolorization of dyes was studied using different culture conditions like agitation and stationary 
conditions to find out the pattern of decolorization / degradation. Influence of provided shaking condition was 
studied on orbital environmental shaker agitating at 150 rpm at room temperature. For stationary condition 
experiment was conducted without agitation at RT.  
 
2.8. Determination of factors responsib le for dye degradation (Enzyme analysis ) 
Decolorization is mainly a biological process, either a direct enzymatically catalyzed reaction 
involving non -specific enzymes or a reaction with enzymatically reduced electron carriers. To study the possible 
enzyme s involved in decolorization Plate screening method  was used. Spot inoculation of culture in sterilized 
Nutrient agar plates having added 0.02% Guaiacol plates is incubated at 30ºC for 4 days.  
 
2.9 Preparation of cell free extract  
The consortium azo 8 and individual were grown separately in the BHM with 0.05% YE for 24 hours 
at RT and then transferred to the same media incorporated with 100 ppm Reactive dyes concentration and 
incubated and monitored for decolorization. After decolorization, each decolorized  culture and azo 8 were 
centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20minutes at 4°C (Eppendorf 5430R). The supernatant was filtered through 0.45mm 
filter (Millipore) and the resulting cell free filtrate culture supernatant was designated as the Crude Culture 
Fraction (CC F), used for the assay of crude extracellular enzymatic activity. The cell pellets were suspended in 
potassium phosphate buffer (PPB) (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1g ml-1 of lysozyme then were incubated at RT 
for 30 min and cells were subjected to sonicati on (Frontline Sonicator - 250) constant 250 Hz for 6 cycles, each 
cycle for 60 secondand similar interval was kept between each cycle at 4°C[9]. The cell lysate was mixed with 
equal amount of PP (Protein Precipitation) buffer. The protein pellet were disso lved in a minimum quantity of 
20mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and the protein was loaded on to a Sephadex G -75 column (size 1 
cm x 20 cm), purification column and centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 1 minute. The column was washed with 
washed buffer and protein were eluted using elute buffer and (Protein purification kit) used as the source of 
intracellular partially purified proteins.  
 
2.10 Laccase enzyme assay  
Assay of the enzyme laccase was using reaction mixture contained 1 ml 0.1mM Guaiacol, 3 ml 10 mM 
Sodium phosphate buffer (SPB) pH 7.0 with 1ml crude filtrate and/or partially purified protein as source of 
laccase in total volume of 5 mL at Room Temperature. The change in absorbance of the reaction mixture Isolation and Development of a Bacterial Consortium for Biodegradation of Textile Dyes..

calculated using extinction coefficient and µg of Guaiacol oxidized/minute. Specific activity was calculated was 
expressed in units per milligram protein.  
 
2.11 TLC analysis  
Thin Layer Chromatog raphy was used for separation of degraded product of azo dye. The solvent 
system used was Butanol: Water: Acetic acid, (5:3:2).Resulted TLC plates were resolved with 0.2% Ninhydrin 
spray.  
 
2.12 HPLC analysis  
HPLC analysis was carried out model Agilent 1200  series, on Hypersil BDS C18 column (250 x 4.6 
mm, 5 micron particle size, Pheniminex). The mobile phase was HPLC grade Acetonitrile and phosphate buffer 
(90:10 v/v) with flow rate was 1 ml/min. The decolorized culture medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 
min and supernatant was collected and filter through 0.45 PVDF filter and then analyzed. The purity was 
checked by PDA detector, isocratic system and 45 min run time [10].  
 
2.13 LC -MS analysis  
LC-MS of biodegraded reactive dyes were carried out usin g Model AB Sciex API 2000 by comparing 
with control dyes. The LC -MS analysis was done with auto (2mm/sec) speed. The decolorized culture medium 
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and supernatant was collected and filter through 0.45 PVDF filter and 
then used with methanol for LC -MS analysis. 20 µl of prepared sample and dyes of 100 ppm concentration were 
injected. Operating conditions were dry with temperature of 325ºC, capillary voltage 3500V. The ion trap 
detector with atmospheric pressure electro – spray ionization (API – ESI) source was used for in negative 
ionization mode. Ion trap full scan analyses were conducted from m/z 120 -1000 with an upper full time of cps.  
 
III. Results and Discussion  
3.1 Screening of dye degrading organisms  
The main objective of this study was to screen out bacterial strains capable of decolorization and 
biodegradation of Reactive Red 31 and Reactive Black 5 azo dyes. Present study resulted in isolation of three 
strains all capable of degrading azo dye. All strains isolated fro m dye polluted soil indicates the natural 
adaptation of these bacteria to survive in the presence of toxic dye. All three bacterial isolates were developed in 
consortium able to degrade dye at wide range of temperature RT to 40°C and decolorization at opti mum at 
neutral to acidic pH.  
 
3.2 Identification of bacterial consortium  
The three bacteria in the consortium belongs to Escherichia coli (Azo 6), Bacillus cereus (Azo 9) and 
Bacillus infantis (Azo 12). The similar study was conducted by [11] for identific ation of bacterial consortium 
PMB11, a combination of three bacteria.  
 
3.3Effect of different dye concentration  
The mix consortia have shown decolorization activity at concentration between 100 -1000 ppm. The 
decolorization activity of the cultures was stro ngly inhibited at higher concentration of dye, (Fig 3.2). It has 
been proposed that dye concentration can influence the efficiency of microbial decolorization through 
combination of factor including the toxicity imposed by dye at higher concentration [12].  Thus consortium azo 
8, could decolorize dye much above the reported dye concentration in wastewaters, and can be successfully 
employed for treatment of textile effluents.

3.4 Effect of static and shaking condition  
Under static condition consortium culture exhibited remarkable decolorization / degradation, 84% of Reactive 
Red 31 (Figure 3.4) within 36 hours while 86% (maximum) of Reactive Black 5 ( Figure 3.4) in 30hrs of 
incubation. While comparable reduced decolorization was recorded under the shaking condition even after the 
48 hours of incubation. Further incubation did show very little changes in decolorization activity under shaking 
condition.

3.5 Determination of factors responsible for dye degradation (Enzyme analysis)  
Plate screening method show dark brown zone was observed around colonies producing laccase enzy me 
responsible for dye degradation (photo plate 3.5). Extracellular oxidoreductases, including lignin peroxidase 
(LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase produced by wood -decomposing microorganism, are directly 
involved in the degradation of lignin in  their natural lignocellulosic substrates and various xenobiotic 
compounds including dyes [13]. The production of lignolytic enzymes is observed as a colorless halo around 
microbial growth [14]. So, the Azo dyes degradation capability of consortium azo 8 i s due to laccase initially 
and primarily confirmed by plate screening method.

3.6 Laccase enzyme assay  
The protein concentration after cell lysis was estimated as 900g/ml by  Folin -Lowry protein estimation 
method. The enzymatic analysis of consortium azo 8 (after decolorization) for Reactive Red 31 was calculated 
(Table: 3.6.1) 2.04 and 4.43 units/mg of protein from crude filtrate and partially purified enzymes respectively, 
and for Reactive Black 5 was calculated (Table: 3.6.2) 3.03 from crude filtrate and 4.10 units/mg of protein 
from partially purified enzymes. Similar studies were reported by [15] and [16].

HPLC chromatogram of control Reactive Black 5 showed ma jor peak at retention time 12.454 min and 
3.204 (Figure 3.8.2 (a)). Decolorized treated sample of Reactive Black 5 shows two peaks at retention time 
2.450 min and 3.426 min (Figure 3.8.2 (b)) suggest the degradation of Reactive Black 5. Similar studies car ried 
out by [17] HPLC analysis of a dye Remazol Black B and its degraded products. Reported peaks of metabolites 
shifted towards lower retention time compared to the control peak at quite higher retention time which 
suggested the formation of less aromatic  amines and more polar compounds by biodegradation process of 
bacteria. Identification of metabolites should be the objective of further detail investigations.

similar significant peak of 301.2 m/z. The other all peak presents in the spec trum of control Reactive Black 5 
dyes were absents in the treated sample, indicating the entire dye molecule has been decomposed to colorless 
low molecular weight unidentified fragments by consortium azo 8. [18] reported similar studies LC -MS analysis

IV. Conclusion  
In the present study, a potential azo dye degrading consortium was developed and identified by 16S 
rRNA sequencing. The identified culture belonged to Bacillus species and Escherichia species. The study of 
laccase enzyme in bacterial consorti um azo 8 resulted in increased enzymatic activities compared to individual 
confirmed its involvement in dye decolonization. TLC analysis confirmed the dyes decolonization was due to 
its degradation. Further, HPLC and LC -MS analysis confirmed the biodegrada tion of reactive Red 31 and 
Reactive Black 5, and indicates the degraded metabolites were of simple and non -toxic.  
As a conclusion this study reports that the potential developed consortium azo 8 could be successfully 
applied in contaminated industrial eff luents and in the safe bioremediation of textile effluents.
