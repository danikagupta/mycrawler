BIOGRAHPY : Dr. Joydev Laha started his independent research career at NIPER S.A.S. Nagar 
on July 2011. Prior to joining the NIPER, Dr. Laha was employed on a permanent position in the 
Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration (LDDN) at Harvard Medical School. Dr. 
Laha obtained a Ph.D. degree in organic chemistry from the National Chemical Laboratory at 
2 
 Pune under the mentorship of Prof. Ganesh Pandey. He acquired a total of about five years of 
postdoctoral research experiences in synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the 
North Carolina State University and Mayo Clinic in the United States. Dr. Laha has versatile 
research experiences including target-driven method development in organic synthesis, natural 
product synthesis, and medicinal chemistry research directed to structure-based drug discovery. 
Dr. Laha’s current research interests include oxidative radical reactions largely using persulfates, 
understanding their mechanisms, and applications to the synthesis of heterocycles and API 
(active pharmaceutical ingredient) synthesis. Over the past ten years in his independent career, 
he has mentored two Postdoctoral Fellows, eight PhDs and six three Master’s students. Dr Laha 
and his group have demonstrated a translational application of a laboratory concept to prepare a 
marketed drug, Sildenafil (ViagraTM). He is author or co-author of seventy three papers 
published in peer-reviewed international journals and has two US Patents to his credit. He has 
been serving referee to the ACS, RSC, Science Direct, and Wiley journals. He has delivered 
invited lectures/oral presentations extensively in India and abroad.
