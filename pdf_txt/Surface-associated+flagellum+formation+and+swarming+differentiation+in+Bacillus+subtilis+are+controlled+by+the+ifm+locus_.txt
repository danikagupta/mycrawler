Knowledge of the highly regulated processes governing the production of ﬂagella in Bacillus subtilis is the
result of several observations obtained from growing this microorganism in liquid cultures. No information isavailable regarding the regulation of ﬂagellar formation in B.subtilis in response to contact with a solid surface.
One of the best-characterized responses of ﬂagellated eubacteria to surfaces is swarming motility, a coordinatecell differentiation process that allows collective movement of bacteria over solid substrates. This studydescribes the swarming ability of a B.subtilis hypermotile mutant harboring a mutation in the ifmlocus that
has long been known to affect the degree of ﬂagellation and motility in liquid media. On solid media, themutant produces elongated and hyperﬂagellated cells displaying a 10-fold increase in extracellular ﬂagellin. Incontrast to the mutant, the parental strain, as well as other laboratory strains carrying a wild-type ifmlocus,
fails to activate a swarm response. Furthermore, it stops to produce ﬂagella when transferred from liquid tosolid medium. Evidence is provided that the absence of ﬂagella is due to the lack of ﬂagellin gene expression.However, restoration of ﬂagellin synthesis in cells overexpressing /H9268
Dor carrying a deletion of ﬂgM does not
recover the ability to assemble ﬂagella. Thus, the ifmgene plays a determinantal role in the ability of B.subtilis
to contact with solid surfaces.
Bacterial structures facing the cell surface play a critical role
in establishing and maintaining interactions with the environ-ment. In motile eubacteria, the ﬂagellar organelle is the mostcomplex and exposed extracytoplasmic structure and is madeup of many proteins that are sequentially assembled from thecytoplasmic membrane outward. This highly regulated processis governed, at least in part, by the hierarchical expression ofﬂagellar genes that are organized in classes in both the entericbacteria and Bacillus subtilis . While class II genes encode struc-
tural and regulatory proteins needed for assembly of the hook-basal body, class III genes, whose expression depends on thelate-ﬂagellar-stage sigma factor ( /H9268
28in the enterics and /H9268Din
B.subtilis ), encode proteins required for the maturation of
ﬂagella and the chemosensory system (reviewed in references1, 22, and 30).
The ﬂagellum is essential for active movement of individual
cells in a liquid environment (swimming) and for chemotaxisand plays an important role in interaction with surfaces as asensor of medium viscosity (23) or as an adhesion tool (12).Flagellum-driven motility may help pathogens to reach theirtarget, thus contributing to bacterial virulence (32).
Bacteria may experience two different life-styles, depending
on whether they grow in liquid environments or are in contactwith solid surfaces. The transition from free to sessile growthrequires the sensing of yet unknown surface-related signals andtheir processing to trigger a productive interaction with thesolid surface. This type of adaptation is particularly importantfor soil bacteria such as B.subtilis that rapidly shift from plank-
tonic to sessile life, depending on microenvironmental condi-tions.
Among the best-characterized responses of ﬂagellated bac-
teria to contact with solid surfaces is the cooperative behaviorknown as swarming motility. Swarming can be considered astrategy for rapid spread over solid surfaces in the environment
and for active colonization of mucosal surfaces in infectedhosts (2, 4). Swarming bacteria produce highly organized com-munities of elongated and aseptate cells that exhibit a remark-able increase in the number of ﬂagella in comparison to shortoligoﬂagellated cells growing in liquid media (8, 15, 17, 19, 39).Although it has been shown that swarming motility requiresthe integrity of the ﬂagellar and chemotaxis systems in bothgram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (5, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20,31, 39, 41), almost nothing is known about the molecular mech-anisms involved in the sensory transduction pathways of celldifferentiation in response to solid clues.
Strikingly different colony patterns have been described for
B.subtilis , depending on nutrient availability, agar concentra-
tion (36), and surfactin production (20). In this study, we de-scribe the isolation of a B.subtilis hypermotile mutant that
exhibits the ability to swim or swarm depending on whether itis propagated in liquid or on solid media. The hypermotilestrain carries a mutation in the ifmlocus described in 1969 by
Grant and Simon (13) that affects the degree of motility andlevel of ﬂagellation of B.subtilis during growth in liquid media.
In contrast to the mutant, we found that the parental straindoes not mount a swarming response and even stops to pro-duce ﬂagella when transferred from liquid to solid medium.Evidence is also provided that other motile B.subtilis strains

produce ﬂagella over solid surfaces.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and media. Table 1 lists the B.subtilis strains used in this
study. For mapping purposes, a set of B.subtilis mutants constructed by several
laboratories (38) was used. The strains were grown at 37 °C in either tryptone-
NaCl (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl [TrB]), nutrient broth, Schaeffer sporulationmedium, or Luria-Bertani broth (LB). The media were routinely solidi ﬁed with
1.5% agar unless otherwise noted. Surfactin production was assayed on bloodagar plates (Columbia agar with sheep blood; Oxoid) as described by Nakano etal. (29). Escherichia coli DH5/H9251supE44 lacU169 (/H927880 lac /H9004ZM15 )hsdR17 recA1
endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1 was used as the host for construction of recombinant
plasmids. E.colicells were grown in LB broth. When necessary, antibiotics were
used at the following concentrations: 100 /H9262g of ampicillin/ml; 1 /H9262g of erythro-
mycin/ml; 2.5 /H9262g of kanamycin/ml; and 5 /H9262g of chloramphenicol/ml.
Genetic techniques. B.subtilis strains were transformed with chromosomal or
plasmid DNA by using the procedure of Kunst and Rapoport (21). Transductionmapping with the PBS1 phage was performed according to Hoch et al. (18). E.
colitransformation was performed following standard protocols (37).
Motility assays. For swimming motility, strains were propagated in gelatin-
agar (motility plate) having the following composition: 1% Bacto Peptone, 8%Bacto Gelatin, 1% Bacto Agar, 0.5% NaCl, and 25 /H9262g of the appropriate growth
requirement/ml (Table 1). Phenotypic assays for swarming were initiated byspotting 2 /H9262l of an overnight culture at the center of tryptone-NaCl plates
containing 1.5% agar (TrA). The plates were analyzed after growth for up to 24to 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. Bacteria were Gram stained for microscopy to
evaluate the presence of elongated swarm cells (39). Flagellum staining wasperformed as described by Harshey and Matsuyama (16).
Construction of mutant strains. To construct strain PB5250 with a deletion of
theﬂagellin-encoding gene ( hag), a sequence of 717 bp was replaced with the
kanamycin resistance determinant. First, a 330-bp DNA fragment correspondingto the region upstream of the hag coding sequence (from nucleotide 375 to
nucleotide 45 with respect to the initiation of transcription) was ampli ﬁed by
PCR by using the primers HagB (5 /H11032-CGGGATCC CATTATTG TGAATCGCA
AG-3/H11032) and HagE (5 /H11032-CGGAATTC AAAAAAATCCTCACTTTTTTTGTGAG
GAT-3 /H11032). The Bam HI (HabB) and EcoRI (HagE) recognition sequences are in
bold. The template was chromosomal DNA of B.subtilis PB168. The ampli ﬁed
fragment was puri ﬁed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, and re-
stricted with EcoRI and Bam HI. After puri ﬁcation, the DNA fragment was
ligated into the EcoRI and Bam HI sites of plasmid pJM114 (33), thus generating
pTCH1. The ligated plasmid was used to transform E.coli DH5/H9251. A second
DNA fragment of 180 bp, extending from codon 224 to codon 283 of the hag
coding sequence, was obtained by PCR by using primers HagC (5 /H11032-CCATCGA
TCAACCAAGTTTCTTCTCAACGT-3 /H11032) and HagK (5 /H11032-GG GGTACC TGAGA
AAGAATGTTGTTCTTTG-3 /H11032). The ClaI (HagC) and KpnI (HagK) sites are in
bold. The ampli ﬁed DNA was restricted with ClaI and KpnI, treated as above,
and cloned into pTCH1, the pJM114 derivative digested with ClaI and KpnI. The
ﬁnal plasmid, named pTCH2, contained two DNA fragments derived fromPB168 ﬂanking the kanamycin resistance determinant. The plasmid was veri ﬁed
by sequencing. The plasmid DNA (pTCH2) was linearized by Bam HI digestion
and used to transform competent cells of PB168. After selection for kanamycinresistance, one transformant was characterized by PCR and named PB5250. Toconstruct strain PB5332, we followed the marker congression procedure usingDNA from the surfactin producer strain PB1927 as described by Nakano et al.(29). Selection was for Trp
/H11001transformants, followed by screening for surfactin
production on blood agar plates.
/H9252-Galactosidase activity assay. To measure /H9252-galactosidase activity, overnight
cultures in sporulation medium were diluted in fresh medium and samples (1.0ml) were taken at 30-min intervals for reading of optical density at 525 nm(OD
525) and determination of /H9252-galactosidase activity, which is expressed in
modi ﬁed Miller units (34).
RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA was puri ﬁed from B.subtilis cultures
grown in TrB or TrA for 6 h. Cells were harvested from plates by washing thesurface of agar plates with cold diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water or collectedfrom liquid cultures by centrifugation at 4,000 /H11003gfor 15 min. After being washed
with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, about 1 /H1100310
8bacterial cells were
resuspended in 450 /H9262l of RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini kit; QIAGEN) containing
0.35 g of glass beads (diameter 0.1 mm) and vortexed for 15 min to break thecells. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 /H11003g, and the aqueous phase
was removed. Two hundred microliters of absolute ethanol was added, and themixture was applied to an RNeasy Mini Spin column (QIAGEN). After beingdigested with 40 Kunitz units of RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN) for 20 h, totalRNA was eluted from the column according to the instructions of the manufac-turer. An aliquot of the RNA was examined on agarose gel to ensure its integrity.Reverse transcription (RT)-PCRs were performed in one-step reactions. Up to1/H9262g of RNA was mixed with 0.8 /H9262M (each) primer in AMV/T ﬂbuffer (50 mM
Tris HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl
2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM
spermidine) containing 1.0 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate,
2 5UT ﬂpolymerase (Promega), and 3.75 U of AMV reverse transcriptase
(Promega) in a ﬁnal volume of 25 /H9262l. Reactions were incubated at 48 °C for 60
min. PCR ampli ﬁcation was as follows: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1
min, and 72 °C for 1 min for the haggene; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for
1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for ﬂiM,ﬂgM,sigD, and cheW . The following primers
were used: HAGU1 (5 /H11032-CACAATATTGCAGCGCTTAA-3 /H11032) and HAGL1 (5 /H11032-
TAATAATTGAAGTACGTTTTG-3 /H11032) for hag, BSFLIMU (5 /H11032-CTCCCAAAAT
GAAATAGATG-3 /H11032) and BSFLIML (5 /H11032-TTCTCCATCTTGTTCACCTCT-3 /H11032)
forﬂiM, FLGMF1 (5 /H11032-AATCAATTTGGAACACA-3 /H11032) and FLGMR3 (5 /H11032-ATT
TGCGTCTACTTTGTA-3 /H11032) for ﬂgM, BSSIGDU (5 /H11032-GAATTATGAAGATCA
GGTG-3 /H11032) and BSSIGDL (5 /H11032-TTGTATCACTTTTTCCAGCAG-3 /H11032) for sigD,
and CHEWF (5 /H11032-GGTAAATGGCAAAGAATATG-3 /H11032) and CHEWR (5 /H11032-AG
CTTGATCGGGCACAG-3 /H11032) for cheW . Contamination by DNA was checked by
performing reactions without the addition of the AMV reverse transcriptase.Positive controls were obtained by using genomic DNA as the template.
Protein samples, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis. Bacterial cells
were grown in TrB or TrA fo r8ha t3 7 °C. Cells were harvested from the plates
by washing the surfaces of agar plates with cold water and were normalized withrespect to the OD
600of liquid cultures. Cell suspensions were vortexed and
centrifuged at 5,000 /H11003gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Flagellar ﬁlaments were collected
from the supernatants by high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 /H11003gfor 1 h and
suspended in protein sample buffer containing /H9252-mercaptoethanol (37). Bacterial
pellets were lysed in the same buffer by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein
samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min and subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Gels were either silverstained (6) or electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and probed with rabbit anti-bodies to B.subtilis ﬂagellin followed by incubation with a secondary antibody
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The peroxidase activity was visualizedby diaminobenzidine colorimetric reaction in accordance with standard proce-dures (37).
RESULTS
Isolation of a B.subtilis hypermotile mutant. A spontaneous
hypermotile mutant was selected by spotting the strain PB1831(trpC2 pheA1 ) in the middle of a motility plate. Following
overnight incubation at 37 °C, the rim of the growth halo was
picked and transferred onto nutrient agar, and single colonieswere tested for increased motility, essentially as described byPooley and Karamata (35). One isolate, referred to as PB5249,was retained and used for subsequent analysis.TABLE 1. B. subtilis strains used in this study

was mapped by transformation crosses. B.subtilis strains with
antibiotic resistance markers present in different positions onthe chromosome (38) were used as DNA donors. Competentcells of the mutant were transformed, selected for antibioticresistance, and screened for motility. The mutation wasmapped between haganduvrA , at approximately 310 °on the B.
subtilis chromosome. In particular, 80% cotransformation with
a resistance marker present in the gene yvjA was observed. A
more detailed mapping was not attempted. This map positionagrees with the previously reported location of an ifmmutation
(13, 35); thus, the PB5249 mutant was tentatively named ifmP .
The increased motility of PB5249 might be explained by an
increased number of ﬂagella. This possibility was supported by
the observation that the mutant produced more ﬂagellar anti-gen than the parental strain. In fact, the presence of a ﬂagel-
lum-speci ﬁc antiserum completely inhibited motility of the pa-
rental strain when included in motility agar at a ﬁnal dilution of
1:10,000. This dilution was ineffective with the mutant strain,which required a 10-fold higher concentration of antiserum(data not shown). A higher amount of ﬂagellin was detected by
gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting in supernatants frombroth cultures of the mutant than from the parental strain;moreover, ﬂagellin accumulation during growth started 1 h
earlier in the mutant than in the parental strain (data not
shown). The molecular mass of the ﬂagellin monomer from the
mutant was the same as the monomer from the parent; whenmixed in a one-to-one ratio and analyzed by MALDI-TOFmass spectrometry, a single peak was found, with an estimatedmass of 32,540 Da (calculated mass, 32,472 Da).
The increased level of ﬂagellin in the ifmP mutant could
have different explanations, such as higher transcription rate,increased stability of the protein, or faster assembly of theﬂagellin monomers. We measured the level of expression of
theﬂagellin gene by using a hag-lacZ transcriptional fusion,
integrated ectopically into the chromosomes of PB1831 andPB5249, thus generating the strains PB5308 and PB5309, re-spectively. The kinetics of /H9252-galactosidase synthesis was similar
in the two strains (Fig. 1), but the peak value in PB5309 (2,500U) was about three times the value obtained with the strainPB5308 (850 U). Therefore, the observed difference betweenPB1831 and PB5249 in the level of ﬂagellin detected by im-
munoblotting was consistent with an increased level of hag
gene transcription.
ifmand the surface contact response. On TrA plates, the
strains PB1831 and PB5249 produced morphologically distinctcolonies. The parental strain produced extremely rough colo-nies (Fig. 2A), while the colonies produced by PB5249 wereless rough and often exhibited a layered, terraced appearanceupon aging (Fig. 3A). Microscopic inspection of the coloniesshowed that the parental strain formed long cell chains pref-erentially aligned along the major axis and curled (Fig. 2B).The ﬁlaments were long, up to 50 /H9262m, and septa were always
present (Fig. 2C). It appeared that the whole community wasconstituted by short (2 to 3 /H9262m), rod-shaped cells that were
indistinguishable from those growing in liquid media (Fig. 2D).More striking was the complete absence of cells bearing ﬂagel-

were never viewed at agar concentrations ranging from 2 to0.5% (Fig. 2H); however, the ability of PB1831 to produceﬂagella in liquid medium (Fig. 2E) was retained at agar con-
centrations lower than or equal to 0.3% (Fig. 2F and G). Ofgreat interest was the observation that this behavior was notpeculiar to PB1831 but was shared by all the B.subtilis strains
carrying a wild-type ifmlocus, such as the reference strain 168
(PB168) and two of its oldest derivatives, PB25 and PB1424(Table 1). Cells taken from the ifmP mutant colonies (Fig. 3B)
were longer (8 to 16 /H9262m long) (Fig. 3C) than cells grown in
liquid medium (Fig. 3D) and were without septa. Moreover, anincreased number of ﬂagella was seen on elongated cells (Fig.
3E and F) in comparison with that for the oligo ﬂagellated cells
grown in liquid media (Fig. 3G). Flagella of the hyper ﬂagel-
lated cells appeared to be very fragile, since large amounts ofﬂagellar ﬁlaments were very often observed detached from
cells in stained preparations (Fig. 3F). The ﬁnding that the
strain PB5249 produces elongated and hyper ﬂagellated cells
when propagated over the surface of solid media demonstratesthat B.subtilis is provided with the ability to undergo swarming
differentiation. Swarming by PB5249 occurred at a wide rangeof temperatures (20 to 37 °C) and on different solid media
(TrA, nutrient, and LB agar). Macroscopically, B.subtilis
swarm colonies did not exhibit regularly layered consolidationphases alternated with swarming migration (Fig. 3A), as hasalready been reported for other Bacillus species (11, 39).
To estimate the extent of surface-induced hyper ﬂagellation
in strain PB5249, we measured the differences in the amount ofextracellular ﬂagellin in equivalent numbers of cells taken from
TrB and TrA by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a B.
subtilis antiﬂagellin antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3H, cells
grown on the solid medium exhibited an almost 10-fold in-crease in ﬂagellin compared to those grown in liquid, and the
ﬂagellin monomers appeared to have the same molecular
weight (Fig. 3I). To con ﬁrm the identity of ﬂagellin subunits in
swim and swarm cells, a mutant with a deletion of the haggene
(PB5250) was constructed by gene replacement with a kana-mycin resistance determinant. As expected, the cells failed toswim in liquid media as well as to swarm on solid surfaces,further supporting the ﬁnding that the same type of ﬂagellar
subunit is employed for the assembly of ﬂagella in swim and
swarm cells.
Surfactin is a B.subtilis lipopeptide antimicrobial surfactant
whose activity has recently been related to the ability of anundomesticated B.subtilis strain to swarm (20). Many B.sub-
tilislaboratory strains derived from 168, including PB1831, are
defective in surfactin biosynthesis due to a frameshift mutationin the sfpgene (28). Nevertheless, we tested PB5249 for the
ability to produce surfactin. No hemolytic activity was observedon blood agar plates, indicating that the strain is not a surfactinproducer. To evaluate whether the swarming behavior of PB5249was affected by the ability to produce surfactin, we constructedstrain PB5332, a surfactin-producing derivative of PB5249. Theeffect of surfactin production on swarming was limited to aslight increase in the size of colonies (Fig. 4) that did not showalternate cycles of swarming migration and consolidation, asalready noted for strain PB5249.

observation that PB1831 failed to undergo surface-inducedswarming differentiation and, what is more, failed to produceﬂagella upon growth on a solid surface induced us to get
further insights on the molecular events involved in the re-sponse of PB1831 to the solid surface. To this end, the tran-scription of genes required for ﬂagella formation was analyzed.
First, we checked for transcripts of the hagclass III gene by
RT-PCR, and expression of hag was never detected when
PB1831 was grown on solid media (Fig. 5, lane 3). This resultwas in accordance with the observation that PB5308 producedwhite colonies on plates containing X-gal (data not shown).
Since the haggene is transcribed from a /H9268
D-dependent pro -
moter (25), we analyzed the expression of the ﬂa/che class II
operon that includes the /H9268D-encoding gene ( sigD) by RT-PCRs
performed at three different positions along the approximate-
ly 26-kb operon. Transcriptional scanning showed that theoperon was expressed all over its length and included sigD (Fig.
5, lanes 5, 7, 9). Thus, the lack of hagexpression in solid media
could not be interpreted simply as the consequence of a missedtranscription of the late- ﬂagellar-stage sigma factor. To under-
stand whether the level of sigD expression played a key role in
hag transcription in strain PB1831 grown on solid surfaces,
PB1831 was transformed with the plasmid pSigD, which carriesa copy of the sigD gene under control of the IPTG (isopro-
pyl-/H9252-
D-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible Pspac promoter (3).
PB1831 harboring pSigD restored the ability to produce ﬂagel-
lin when grown on solid agar plates in the presence of theinducer (Fig. 6; lane 2). This result demonstrates that the levelof intracellular /H9268
Din PB1831 propagated on solid surfaces is
not suf ﬁciently high to promote hagexpression.
The activity of /H9268Dis intracellularly balanced by the anti-
sigma factor FlgM (10). Therefore, experiments were per-
formed to evaluate if on solid media (i) the ﬂgMwas tran-
scribed in PB1831 and (ii) ﬂagellin was synthesized in a
PB1831 derivative carrying a deletion in ﬂgM(PB5148). A
positive signal was obtained by RT-PCR for the ﬂgMgene in
cells of strain PB1831 (Fig. 5, lane 11), and ﬂagellin synthesis
was restored in strain PB5148, as demonstrated by immunoblotanalysis (Fig. 6, lane 4). These results show that intracellular
FlgM can potentially be responsible for /H9268Dinactivity and, con -
sequently, for missed hagexpression in strain PB1831 grown on
solid media. However, cells overexpressing the transcriptionfactor /H9268
Dand cells lacking FlgM recovered only part of their
biosynthetic potential, since they did not acquire the ability to
produce ﬂagella when grown on solid media. The lack of ﬂa-
gella in PB1831 suggests that the ifmP locus regulates the
complex process of ﬂagella formation in response to external
stimuli coming from liquid or solid environments at a not-yet-deﬁned level.
DISCUSSION
Bacterial ﬂagella are organelles of the cell envelope instru-
mental to interaction with the environment. Flagellum-drivenmotility is one of the most impressive features in the cellularphysiology of eubacteria and allows active bacterial movementin liquid as well as over solid surfaces. In the environment, theability to swim enables individual cells to rapidly respond tochanges in nutrient availability, moving toward attractants oraway from repellents through a signal transduction chemotac-tic network. In contrast to swimming, the movement of ﬂagel-
lated bacteria over solid surfaces is a striking multicellularbehavior, which enables bacterial cells to move collectively in acoordinated fashion referred to as swarming motility (17).Swarming, which is not triggered by starvation but by contactwith solid surfaces, closely depends on the ability of swimmercells to undergo a surface-induced differentiation process lead-ing to the production of elongated and hyper ﬂagellated swarm
cells (8, 15, 17, 19, 39). Swarming over solid surfaces is a wayfor bacteria to disperse and to colonize the environment thatfavors the establishment of commensal, symbiotic, or patho-genic associations with plants and animals to reach optimalcolonization niches (27, 32).
B.subtilis is aﬂagellated soil bacterium ubiquitously distrib-
uted in the environment. It possesses a remarkable metabolicand physiological versatility that facilitates its propagation in awide range of growth conditions, including liquid and solidsubstrates. As with other ﬂagellated bacteria, the ability to
alternate swimming with swarming motility in response to asurface stimulus may be of evident adaptive value for thisorganism. In this report, we show that swarming is not a wide-spread behavior of B.subtilis laboratory strains but can be
observed only in a strain exhibiting a hypermotile phenotypedue to a mutation in the ifmlocus.
The hypermotile ifmP mutant responds to contact with a
solid surface similarly to other Bacillus species (11, 20, 39). The
swarm colonies produced by the ifmP mutant only occasionally
had a terraced appearance and never exhibited the consolida-

subtilis swarm cells are 3 to 5 times longer and almost 10 times
more ﬂagellated than the swimmer cells. The ifmP mutant was
unable to produce surfactin, which has been shown to play arole in B.subtilis swarming (20). In this study, we provide
evidence that surfactin facilitates bacterial migration over solidsurfaces but is not essential for swarming differentiation in anifmP background.
The same motile organelle appears to be required for swim-
ming and swarming movements in B.subtilis . Indeed, a ﬂagellin
monomer of the same molecular weight is assembled by B.
subtilis grown in liquid or on solid media, and disruption of the
haggene abolishes surface translocation. This phenomenon is
similar to that found in some members of the Enterobacteri-
aceae (15, 41) but differs from that observed in Vibrio para-
haemolyticus , which produces distinct ﬂagellar organelles for
swimming and swarming motility (24).
Integrity in the expression of ﬂagellar and chemotaxis genes
is an essential requirement for swimming and swarming motil-ity in several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (5, 7,11, 17, 20, 31, 39, 41). That a ﬂagellar locus can in ﬂuence the
ability to generate ﬂagella only upon contact with a solid sur-
face has never been described before, however. Indeed, theparental strain and all the strains carrying a wild-type ifmlocus
not only failed to activate a swarm response upon contact withthe surface but, remarkably, completely stopped synthesizingﬂagellin and assembling ﬂagellar ﬁlaments. The lack of hag
gene expression can be explained at the regulatory level by afunctional de ﬁciency of the transcription factor /H9268
D. This inter -
pretation is supported by the results obtained by overproduc-tion of /H9268
Din the presence of the plasmid pSigD or by deletion
of the ﬂgMgene encoding the anti-sigma factor FlgM. In both
experimental systems, cells grown on solid surfaces succeededin expressing ﬂagellin; nevertheless, the ability to assemble
ﬂagellar ﬁlaments was not restored.
Thus, in strains having a wild-type ifmbackground, some of
the steps required for the integration of signals derived fromcontact with a solid surface are missing or not functioningproperly. The ifmP mutation, therefore, can be regarded as a
gain of a mutated function, restoring a response lost in theprocess of domestication of B.subtilis .
The presence of a mutant ifmgene appears to be necessary
to correctly perceive the solid-surface signal in order to processand integrate it into the different regulatory pathways thataffect ﬂagellar assembly and functions.
