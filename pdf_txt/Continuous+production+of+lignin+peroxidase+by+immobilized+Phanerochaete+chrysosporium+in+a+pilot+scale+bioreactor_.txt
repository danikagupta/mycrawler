ABSTRACT  
Two samples were collected from Western Ghats area, of Tamilnadu, South India. The collected fungi were isolated and identifi ed based on the key 
provided previously. Phanerochaete chr ysosporium 787 was obtained from Microbial Type Culture Collection, (MTCC) Chandigarh, India and was used as 
the reference fungus. The isolated fungi were identified and used for the optimization and degradation of 2, 4, dichloropheno xy acetic acid and the  results 
were analyzed by gas chromatography. In P. chrysosporium  the maximum growth of the mycelium was found to be 68 mg. In Schizophyllum commune   it 
was found to be 66 mg and in Lenzites eximia  it was reported to be 67 mg. The per cent degradation of 2, 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid by P. 
chrysosporium 787 was observed to be 41.7 per cent.   Similarly the per cent degradation was 32.6 and 39.0 per cent by S. commune and L. eximia  
respectively. The results revealed that P. chrysosporium  is very efficien t for the degradation of 2, 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.

1. INTRODUCTIO N 
The major environmental problems facing the world today 
is the contamination of soil, water and air by toxic chemicals. 
Eighty million pounds of hazardous organopollutats are 
produced annually in United States and only 10 per cent of 
these are disposed o f safely ( Reddy and Mathew , 2001 ). 
The production of pesticides started in India in 1952 and 
now it is the second largest manufacturer of pesticides in 
Asia and ranks twelfth globally ( Marthur 1999 ). Many 
xenobiotic compounds have medium to long term stabi lity in 
soil and their persistence results in significant impact on the 
soil ecosystem ( Gavrilescu, 2005 ). The term pesticide 
covers a wide range of compounds including insecticides, 
fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and others 
(Aktar et al ., 2009 ). Pesticides are usually applied 
simultaneously or one after the other and this type of 
application often leads to a combined contamination of 
pesticide residues in the soil environment ( Chu et al., 2008 ).  
Many polyaromatic hydrocarbons including 
Polychlorinated dibenzodioxin and dichloro -
diphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are mutagenic and toxic to 
humans and animals and are important pollutants present in 
soil and sedimentation. These compounds have long 
existence period and remain in the environment fo r a long 
time ( Siripong et al ., 2009 ). One of the most commonly used 
phenoxyalkanoic herbicide is 2, 4, dichlorophenoxyacetic 
acid for selective control of weeds and defoliation and they 
are reported to be mutagenic ( Sieler, 1978 ). Application of 
pesticide s in urban areas is carried out at an extensively 
high concentration resulting in pesticide waste characterized 
by prolonged persistence ( Khadrani et al., 1999 ). The 
physico chemical remedial strategies to clean up sites 
contaminated by these compounds are  not cost effective or 
adequate enough. Therefore, research is increasingly being focused on biological methods for the degradation and 
elimination of these pollutants ( Jain et al. , 2005 ). 
Biodegradation refers to the metabolic activity of 
microorganisms t o transform organic contaminants into less 
harmful compounds ( Margesin and Schinner,  2001 ).   
Biodegradation is influenced by many factors such as 
the microorganism that can degrade the specific chemical 
structure, environmental conditions that allow the 
microorganism to grow, express their degradation enzymes, 
and establish good physical contact between the organic 
substrate and the organism. Toxic compounds should not be 
present at high concentrations, since they can inactivate 
essential enzyme ( Martin, 1 998). Complete biodegradation 
results in mineralization of xenobiotic compounds to CO 2 
and H 2O (Han et al ., 2004 ).  
Microbial metabolism has long been regarded as the 
most important mechanism of pesticide degradation in soil 
and it constitutes the basis fo r all bioremediation strategies. 
Several conditions that favour microbial growth, activity in 
soil such as temperature, moisture, nutrient status, pH and 
aeration will promote metabolic degradation of pesticides. 
Microorganisms co -metabolize pesticides by oxidation 
reduction, dehalogenation, ring cleavage and hydrolysis 
(Gadd, 2001 ). Sasek ( 2003 ) reported that white rot fungi are 
potentially powerful tools for bioremediation. The application 
of fungi to clean up contaminated soil first came to attention 
in the mid 1980’s when the white rot fungus P. 
chrysosporium  was shown to metabolize a range of organic 
environmental contaminants ( Hernandez et al. 2001 ).  
This ligninolytic system of white rot  fungi  are directly 
involved in the degradation of various xenobi otic compounds 
(Wesenberg, 2003 ). The degradability of white rot fungi is 
due to the strong oxidative activity and the low substrate 
specificity of their ligninolytic enzymes ( Ohkuma et al., 
2001 ). The mechanism of biodegradation depends on the 
compound be ing degraded. The ligninolytic enzymes in 
white rot fungi catalyze the degradation of pollutants by

 using a non specific free radical mechanism. When an 
electron is added or re moved from the ground state of a 
chemical it becomes highly reactive allowing it to give or 
take it electrons from other chemicals. This provides the 
basis for the non specificity of the enzymes and the ability to 
degrade xenobiotics. The main reactions th at are catylezed 
by the ligninolytic enzymes include depolymerization, 
demethoxylation, decarboxylation, hydroxylation and 
aromatic ring opening. These reactions result in oxygen 
activation, creating radicals that facilitate oxidation of 
organopollutants ( Reddy and Mathew, 2001 ). 
Fragoeiro and Magan ( 2008 ) reported the successful 
application of the white rot fungi T. versicolor for the 
bioremediation of mixtures of pesticides in non sterile sandy 
loam soil under low water potential conditions. Bending et al . 
(2002 ) showed 86 per cent degradation of atrazine and 
terbuthylazine by white rot fungi in liquid culture and found 
no relationship between degradation rate and ligninolytic 
activity. T. versicolor  was used for environmental 
remediation of pesticides, ex plosives and industrial solvents 
(Sasek et al ., 2003 ). The degradation of DDT, lindane and 
atrazine by P. chrysosporium  was reported by Reddy and 
Mathew ( 2001 ). The degradation of a variety of 
environmentally persistent pollutants by P. chrysosporium  
has b een reported ( Bumpus et al ., 1985 ). Ryu et al . (2000 ) 
reported the biodegradation of pentachlorophenol by white 
rot fungi Trametes sp.  and Pleurous sp.  under ligninolytic 
and non ligninolytic conditions.  
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
2.1. Collection of fungi  
The fungi Schizophyllum commune and Lenzites eximia were 
collected from Western Ghats area of Tamilnadu, India. 
S.commune  and L.eximia  were isolated from living tree of 
Tamarindus indica,  burnt tree respectively. The collection site 
was situated in the lat itude of -11.58,oS and longitude of 
76.93oE at 400 ± 50M MSL. It receives rain fall of about 300 
mm per year with high humidity and temperature. The 
reference fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium 787 was 
obtained from Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) , 
Chandigarh, India and was used for further studies.  
2.2. Isolation of the fungi  
The portion of the fungi was cut, surface sterilized with 1 per 
cent mercuric chloride solution and then repeatedly washed 
with sterile distilled water ( Roy Watling, 1971 ). The fungi 
were then inoculated on 2 per cent malt agar medium in 
petriplates. Then the fungal growth which occurred on the 
plates was sub cultured on malt agar slants to obtain pure 
culture. The samples were identified based on the 
morphology of the fruitin g bodies and spores based on the 
key provided previously by ( Bakshi 1971; Gilbertson and 
Ryvarden, 1986 ). 
2.3. Preparation of spore suspension  
The fungi were grown in malt agar medium by dissolving 20 g 
of malt extract and 20 g of agar in distilled water a nd made 
up to 1000 ml. The pH was maintained as 6.5 at 37oC.  Then 
the plates were flooded with sterile distilled water and 
brushed with camel hair brush smoothly without disturbing 
the mycelial growth and filtered through a sterile filter. The 
concentrati on of the filtrate was adjusted to 105spores/ml and 
used as inoculums for further studies.  
2.4. Growth kinetics and ligninase 
production   
Growth kinetics and ligininase enzyme production were 
studied in C - Limited medium (M14) of Janshekar and 
Fiechter ( 1988 ).    
2.5. Ligninolytic enzymes production  
Enzymes, lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese -dependent 
peroxidase (MnP) and aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) were 
characterized for its ligninolytic enzymes production. The LiP 
activity was determined using a spectro photometer (OD at 
310 nm) according to the method of Linko ( 1988 ). One unit 
of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme 
oxidizing one mole of veratryl alcohol in 1 min. MnP was 
assayed using a spectrophotometer by the method of Kuwahara et al. ( 1984 ). One unit of enzyme activity was 
expressed as the amount of enzyme capable of increasing 
one optical density (OD) at 610 nm in a min. The aryl alcohol 
oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically as 
described by Waldner ( 1988 ) with veratryl  alcohol as a 
substrate. In this case, one unit of the enzyme activity was 
expressed as the amount of enzyme able to increase one 
OD at 310 nm.  
2.6. Determination of mycelial dry weight 
and enzyme production  
Aliquots (50ml) of medium were taken in 250 ml o f 
Erlenmeyer flask and inoculated with 105 spores/ml 
(inoculums volume - 10%v/v.). The flask was incubated at 
30oC. At regular time intervals, the fungal biomass was 
removed by filtration and the growth was determined as 
mycelial dry weight (mg) by drying the biomass at 105oC to 
a constant weight. The culture filtrate was centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4oC and the clear supernatant was 
used as enzyme immediately. The boiled culture filtrate was 
used as enzyme blank.  
2.7. Effect of culture parameter s on growth 
and ligninolytic enzyme production  
The fungi were grown in C -limited medium ( Jansheker and 
Fiechter, 1988 ) in orbital shaker (120 rpm) to determine the 
optimum culture conditions for growth and ligninase 
production.  
2.7.1. Incubation period  
The white rot fungi were grown at various incubation periods 
at room temperature and the mycelial growth and enzyme 
production were determined at the end of each incubation 
periods.  
2.7.2. pH  
The growth and enzyme production were determined at the 
pH range of  3.0 to 8.0 at room temperature.  
2.7.3. Temperature  
The effect of temperature was determined in the range of 30 
to 80o C. 
2.7.4. Carbon sources  
Different concentrations of D -glucose, sucrose and cellulose 
(0 to 4.0%) were used as carbon sources for growth  and 
ligninase enzyme production.  
2.7.5. Nitrogen sources  
The nitrogenous compounds, di -ammonium tartrate, urea 
and tryptone at different concentrations (0.22 to 1.1%) were 
used as nitrogen sources.  
2.8. Degradation of Xenobiotics  
The degradation of Xe nobiotics was carried out in C -Limited 
medium. The medium was inoculated with fungal spore 
suspension (105 spores/ml) and incubated at 30οC for 6 
days in an orbital shaker. After 6 days the xenobiotics 
compound 2, 4 Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (0.25 µM) wa s 
added to the medium after dissolved in 0.25N NaOH 
solution.  The cultures were incubated at 37°C on a rotary 
shaker at 300 rpm for 15 days. The degradation profile of 2, 
4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid was analyzed by gas 
chromatography. The concentration of 2, 4 dichlorophenoxy 
acetic acid in the sample was determined by gas 
chromatography; this  was extracted with hexane. 0.5 μL 
extract was analyzed on a CBP5 fused silica capillary 
column (25 m × 0.22mm × 0.25 μm; Shimadzu) installed in a 
Shimadzu GC -14A gas chromatography equipped with FID. 
Split injection (1:100) and programmable temperature we re 
used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The oven temperature 
was 80°C for 1 min, increased to 180°C at a rate of 
20°C/min, increased to 220°C at a rate of 4°C/min, 
increased to 280°C at a rate of 20°C/min, and maintained at 
280°C for 5 min. The injection  temperature was 250°C and 
the detector temperature was 250°C. The same procedure 
was carried out for control without the inoculation of white rot 
fungus ( Ryu et al. 2000 ). Species  • RESEARCH  • PHANEROCHAETE CHRYSOSPORIUM

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. Effect of culture condition on growth 
and ligninase production  
3.1.1 . Incubation period    
The effect of incubation period on culture condition and 
ligninase production by P. chrysosporium 787, S. commune 
and L. eximia  were presented in Table 1 . The results 
showed that maximum growth was observed by P. 
chrysosporium  on eleventh and twelfth day (35.6 mg 
mycelial dry weight). Initial production of LiP on first day was 
30 U/ml; it has increased up to 163 U/ml on seven th day of 
incubation period.  Initially MnP production by P.   
chrysosporium was 0.01 U/ml and maximum production was 
observed on seventh day (0.09 U/ml). On the first day, the 
aryl alcohol oxidase enzyme production was 36 U/ml, the 
maximum production (159  U/ml) was achieved on seventh 
day, after that the enzyme production was reduced. The 
entire three enzymes had maximum activity on seventh day 
and then the activity was decreased.  In S. commune   
maximum growth (46.0 mg mycelial dry weight) was 
observed on  twelfth day of incubation. LiP (177 U/ml), MnP 
(0.16 U/ml) and AAO (190 U/ml) were maximum on seventh 
day. In L. eximia  maximum growth (44.0 mg mycelial dry 
weight) was observed on twelfth day; LiP, MnP and AAO 
production were maximum on seventh day and i t was found  Table 4b Effect of carbon sources on growth and ligninase production by Schizophyllum commune

to be 170 U/ml, 0.14 U/ml and 165 U/ml. After the optimum 
period the productions were gradually decreased.  Patrick et 
al. (2011 ) have reported that the optimum temperature for 
maximum laccase and MnP productio n by P. sajor -caju was 
found to be 30°C on day 9 with an activity of 0.2844 U/ml 
and 20°C on day 7 with an activity of 0.0052 U/ml, 
respectively. Very little lignolytic activities were observed at 
temperatures above 30°C probably due to the fact that 
incre asing the temperature could have inhibited the fungal 
growth and hence, low/decreased enzyme activities. The 
same trend has also been demonstrated by Zadrazil et al. 
(1999 ) when Pleurotus species and Dichomitus squalens 
were cultivated at temperatures high er than 30°C.  
3.1.2 pH  
The effect of pH on culture conditions and ligninase 
production were studied in the pH range from 3.0 to 8.5. The 
results revealed ( Table 2 ) that, in P. chrysosporium 787 
maximum (35.0 mg dry weight) growth was observed at pH 
4.5, L iP production and MnP Production were also favoured 
(126 U/ml; 0.06 U/ml) at pH 4.5. At pH 6.0 maximum level of 
AAO was produced (165 U/ml).  In S. commune , maximum 
growth (41.3 mg dry weight) was observed at pH 4.5; LiP, 
MnP and were maximum at pH 4.5 and the production was 
found to be 177.0, 0.09. For AAO maximum enzyme 
production 194 U/ml was observed on pH 6.0.  In L. eximia ,   
maximum growth (37.8 mg dry weight) was observed at pH 
4.5. LiP, MnP productions were maximum at pH 4.5, AAO 
production was favo ured at a pH of 6.5. LiP MnP was 
produced to a maximum of 156 U/ml and 0.07 U/ml 
respectively. In AAO maximum production was observed up 
to 185 U/ml at pH 6.0.  Maximum laccase and MnP produced 
were 0.300 and 0.0074 U/ml, respectively at pH 6.0 (day 7) 
and 5.5 (day 9), respectively. Activities in the most acidic 
medium (pH 3.5) were low compared to slightly acidic 
medium ( Iqbal et al. 2011 ). 
3.1.3. Temperature  
In the present study  the effect of temperature on culture 
condition and ligninase production was st udied in the 
temperature ranges from 30 to 70°C. The results ( Table 3 ) 
showed that, 40°C favoured  mycelial growth (18.0 mg dry 
weight) of P. chrysosporium 787. LiP, MnP and AAO 
productions was favoured at 40°C  and were found to be 
144 U/ml, 0.06 U/ml and 152 U/ml respectively. In S. 
commune , mycelial growth (20.3 mg dry weight) was 
favoured at 40°C. At 40°C, LiP, MnP and AAO were 
produced to a maximum of 152 U/ml, 0.08 U/ml and 163 
U/ml respectively.  In L. eximia  mycelial  growth (34.3 mg dry 
weight) was fa voured at 45°C. The LiP, MnP and AAO 
enzyme productions was found to be maximum at 170 U/ml, 
0.09 U/ml and 181 U/ml respectively.  Nakamura et al. ( 1999 )  Table 5b Effect of nitrogen sources on growth and ligninase production by Schizophyllum commune

reported, maximum lignolytic activity from cultures of 
Badusta were attained at 30°C, but a bove 37°C there was 
no activity observed. Also, Iqbal et al. ( 2011 ) found 
substantial decrease in ligninolytic enzymes of Trametes 
versicolor IBL-04 when cultivated at temperatures higher 
than 30°C.  
3.1.4 . Carbon sources  
The mycelial growth for P. chryso sporium 787, S. commune  
and L. eximia  were favoured at 3.5 g/l for amendments of 
glucose, cellulose and lignin. The carbon source glucose at 
3.5 g/l, 3.0 g/l and lignin 3.5 g/l concentration favoured LiP, 
MnP and AAO production respectively in P. chrysospo rium 
787. In S. commune  lignin at 3.0g/l favoured LiP production, 
glucose 3.0 g/l and lignin 3.5 g/l favoured MnP and AAO 
production respectively. For L. eximia  glucose at 3.5 g/l favoured LiP production, glucose at 3.0 g/l l favoured MnP 
and lignin at 3.5 g/l favoured AAO production respectively. 
The optimum carbon sources for ligninase production were 
determined ( Table 4 ). Patrick et al. ( 2011 ) reported, the 
enzyme production increased with increase in the glucose or 
cellulose concentration up to 10 g/L at  which their maximum 
values were reached and then declined starting at a 
concentration of 15 g/L. For manganese peroxidase 
production, glycerol (2 to 10 g/L) and cellulose (2 to 20 g/L) 
were used as carbon sources. 2 g/L of cellulose and 4 g/L 
glycerol wer e found to be the optimum amounts required for 
maximum MnP production (0.91 and 0.33 U/ml, 
respectively).  
3.1.5. Nitrogen sources  
Among the nitrogen sources, diammonium tartrate at 0.66 
g/l concentration favoured mycelial growth of P. 
chrysosporium 787. But LiP, MnP and AAO production were 
favoured at 0.66 g/l of diammonium tartrate. The optimum 
mycelial growth of S. commune was obtained at 0.66 g/l of 
diammonium tartrate with maximum production of LiP and 
MnP at 0.44 g/l and 0.66 g/l concentration of diam monium 
tartrate whereas AAO was favoured at 0.66 g/l, 
concentration of urea. For L. eximia  maximum mycelial 
growth was favoured at 0.66 g/l of tryptone. LiP was found to 
be maximum at a concentration of 0.66g/l of Urea, MnP and 
AAO was favoured at a maximu m concentration of 0.66 g/l 
of diammonium tartrate respectively.The optimum nitrogen 
source for ligninase production showed in Table 4 . 
3.2. Xenobiotic degradation by white rot 
fungi  
In the present study degradation of 2, 4 dichlorophenoxy 
acetic acid by white rot fungi w as analyzed by gas 
chromatography and the results are tabulated in Table 5 . In 
P. chrysosporium  the maximum growth of the mycelium was 
found to be 68 mg. In S. commune , it was found to be 66 mg 
and in L. eximia it was reported to be 67 mg.  The per cent 
degradation of 2, 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid by P. 
chrysosporium 787 was observed to be 41.7 per cent ( Fig. 
2). Similarly the per cent degradation was 32.6 and 39.0 per 
cent by S. commune and L. eximia  respectively ( Fig 3  and 
Fig 4 ). Biode gradation of xenobiotic compounds depends on 
their concentration, pH of the medium, temperature, 
availability of water and other nutrients and presence of 
organic compounds  (Fig.1, Table 6 ). Bioremediation is 
defined as the application of biological proces ses to the 
treatment of pollution. Recently Mycoremediation plays an 
important role in the degradation of xenobiotics  (Aislabe et 
al., 2007 ). The ligninolytic fungi degrade a wide variety of 
organopollutants such as chlorophenols, chlorolanilines, 
pesticid es such as 2, 4, Dicholorophenoxy acetic acid, DDT, 
methoxychloro and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. These 
pollutants are co -oxidized by the fungi to give CO 2 and 
largely uncharacterized polar metabolites. The xenobiotic 
oxidations by white rot fungi are rapid , efficient and non 
specific and this property allows them to degrade a large 
number of xenobiotics. Biological decomposition of 
pesticides is the most important and effective way to remove 
these compounds from the environment. Microorganisms 
have the abil ity to interact, both chemically and physically, 
with substances leading to structural changes or complete 
degradation of the target molecule. Verdin et al. (2004) 
reported 32 per cent degradation of fluroanthene by the 
white rot fungi P. chrysosporium.  Several fungi, such as 
Agrocybe semiorbicularis , Auricularia auricula , Coriolus 
versicolor , Dichomitus squalens , Flammulina velupites , 
Hypholoma fasciculare , Pleurotus ostreatus , Stereum 
hirsutum, and A. discolor, have shown their ability to 
degrade various pesticide groups like phenylamide, triazine, 
phenylurea, dicarboximide, chlorinated and 
organophosphorus compounds ( Bending et al ., 2002 ). P. 
chysosporium degraded isoproturon belonging to 
phenylurea groups ( Wiren et  al., 2001 ), B. adusta and A. 
discolor Sp4 degraded the pesticide pentachlorophenol 
(Rubilar et al ., 2007) and T. versicolor and Agaricus 
augustus degraded 33 per cent of 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol 
(Donoso et al., 2008 ). In the present study degradation of 2, 
4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid by white r ot fungi was 
analyzed by gas chromatography and the results showed  Figure 1
