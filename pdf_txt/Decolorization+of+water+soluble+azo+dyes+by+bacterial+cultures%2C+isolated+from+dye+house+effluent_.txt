Abstract   
Decolorization of azo dye Red 3BN by two bacterial species Bacillus cereus and B. megaterium has been analyzed using 
mineral effluent, consisting of known concentration  of the dye in ZZ medium. Physico chemical paramete rs like carbon 
source, nitrogen source, temperature, pH and inocul um volume are optimized for the decolorization proc ess by changing one 
parameter  at a time.  Optimal condition for  B. ce reus was found to be 1% sucrose  0.25% peptone,  pH  7,  37°C and 8% 
inoculum and that  for  B.megaterium  was found to be glucose  1% ,  0.25% yeast extract, pH 6, 37 oC and 10% inoculum. 
Extent of decolorization recorded by B. cereus unde r ideal conditions was 93.64% and that by B.megater ium was 96.88%. 
The study has confirmed the potential of B. cereus and B. megaterium in the decolorization of Azo dye Red 3BN and opened 
scope for future analysis of their performance in t he treatment of textile effluent. 
 
Keywords:  Azo dye, Red 3BN, Bacillus cereus B. megaterium,  decolorization. 
 
Introduction  
Rapid industrialization has necessitated the manufa cture and use 
of different chemicals in day to day life 1,2 . The textile industry is 
one of them which extensively use synthetic chemica ls as dyes. 
Wastewaters from textile industries pose a threat t o the 
environment, as large amount of chemically differen t dyes are 
used. A significant proportion of these dyes enter the 
environment via wastewater 1. Approximately 10,000 different 
dyes and pigments are used industrially and over 0. 7 million 
tons of synthetic dyes are produced annually, world wide 3. 
Pollution due to textile industry effluent has incr eased during 
recent years. Moreover, it is very difficult to tre at textile 
industry effluents because of their high BOD, COD, heat, color, 
pH and the presence of metal ions 4. The textile finishing 
generates a large amount of waste water containing dyes and 
represents one of the largest causes of water pollu tion 5, as 10-
15% of dyes are lost in the effluent during the dye ing process 6. 
The traditional textile finishing industry consumes  about 100 
liters of water to process about 1 Kg of textile ma terial. The new 
closed-loop technologies such as the reuse of micro bial or 
enzymatical treatment of dyeing effluents could hel p reducing 
this enormous water pollution 7. 
 
Azo dyes have been used increasingly in industries because of 
their ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis comp ared to 
natural dyes. However, most azo dyes are toxic, car cinogenic 
and mutagenic 8. Azo bonds present in these compounds are 
resistant to breakdown, with the potential for the persistence and 
accumulation in the environment 9. However, they can be 
degraded by bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic co nditions 10 . 
Several physico-chemical techniques have been propo sed for 
treatment of colored textile effluents. These inclu de adsorption 
on different materials, oxidation and precipitation  by Fenton’s 
reagent, bleaching with chloride or ozone photo deg radation or membrane filtration 11 . All these physical or chemical methods 
are very expensive and result in the production of large amounts 
of sludge, which creates the secondary level of lan d pollution. 
Therefore, economic and safe removal of the polluti ng dyes is 
still an important issue. Bioremediation through mi croorganisms 
has been identified as a cost effective and environ ment friendly 
alternative for disposal of textile effluent 12,13 .  
 
In recent years a number of studies have focused on  some 
microorganisms capable of degrading and absorbing d yes from 
wastewater. A wide variety of microorganisms are re ported to 
be capable of decolonization of dyes 12,14-26 . The current study 
has evaluated the potential of two bacterial strain s isolated from 
textile effluent   for their decolorization efficie ncy of the textile 
dye, Red 3BN under in vitro conditions and optimiza tion of the 
factors influencing the process.  
 
Material and Methods  
Textile dye, Red 3BN and effluent sample were colle cted from a 
dying industry located at Peenya, Bangalore (Karnat aka). The 
sample was collected from the effluent disposal sit e of the 
industry. All microbiological media and medium ingr edients 
were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories (Mumbai, M H, 
India). 
 
The dye decolorizing bacteria were isolated from th e effluent by 
serial dilution and plating appropriate dilutions o n modified 
Zhou and Zimmermann (ZZ) agar medium containing (ye ast 
extract-5, glucose-5, (NH 4) 2 SO 4-0.5, KH 2PO 4-2.66, Na 2HPO 4- 
4.32, agar-20 [ all in gL -1 ]  and Dye (Red 3BN) - 100 mgL -1) 
and pH 7.0. All the isolated colonies were studied by 
inoculating them in effluent basal medium containin g (yeast 
extract-5, (NH 4)2 SO 4-0.5, KH 2PO 4-2.66, Na 2HPO 4- 4.32, 
glucose-5 [all in gL -1] and Dye (Red 3BN) - 100 mgL -1)  and pH International Research Journal of Biological Scienc es ________________________________________________

International Science Congress Association 7.0. The inoculated medium was incubated at 30 
under shaking culture conditions. Dye degrading iso lates were 
identified on the basis of morphological and bioche mical tests 
according to Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacterio logy 
The isolates showing more decolorization of the Red 3BN 
selected for further studies.   
 
The dye decolorizing activity of bacteria was evalu ated using a 
modified method of Prasad and  Rao 28 . Decolorization 
was performed in 100 ml of ZZ medium containing 0.0 2g of 
Red 3BN [called as mineral effluent hereafter] and 10% (v/v) 
inoculum of each isolate separately. Mineral effluent withou t 
inoculums served as control. Inoculated medium and control 
were incubated at 30 oC for six days under shake culture 
conditions. About 2 ml of the samples 
aseptically from experimental and control media and  
centrifuged at 8,000 RPM for 15 minutes. The clear supernatant 
was used for measuring absorption at 600 
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The percent 
decolorization of the mineral effluent was determined by the 
following formula:  
 
D= [(A 0-A1) /A 0] x 100 
 
where, D, % of decolorization; A 0, initial absorbance 
absorbance 
 
Decolorization of Red 3BN by the bacterial isolates was 
optimized with respect to the effect of carbon sour ce ( 
sucrose,  meso- inositol), nitrogen source (Beef extract, peptone, 
yeast extract), temperature, pH and inoculum volume 
Decolourization under different culture conditions was done by 
changing the factors one at a time, The basic conditions of 
culture being 30 oC, pH 7.0 under shaking conditions (120 
RPM), 10%, (v/v) inoculum in mineral effluent.  Duration of the 
experiment was for six days. In all the exp 
effluent without culture inoculum was served as control 
six days the samples were withdrawn and analyzed fo r percent 
decolorization of the dye. 
 
The time course of decolorization was carried out under 
optimum conditions obtained fro m  above studies and the 
optimum conditions are: for Bacillus cereus (1% sucrose, 0.25% 
peptone, pH 7, 37 oC and 8% inoculum 
megaterium  (1% glucose, 0.25%  yeast extract, pH 6, 37 
10% inoculum ). Flasks were incubated up to 144h at their 
respective temperature and samples were removed aft er every 
24 h and analyzed for decolorization activity as described 
above.

International Science Congress Association  48  and 2.36%, respectively for B. cereus and B. megaterium.  When 
meso-inositol was used as carbon source 13.64% and 13.83% 
decolorization of the dye was recorded in cultures of B. cereus 
and B. megaterium respectively. From the above data it is 
observed that B. cereus is more efficient in decolorizing Red 
3BN than B. megaterium and sucrose is the ideal carbon source 
for its activity under in vitro condition. 
 
Figure-3 illustrates the effect of different nitrog en sources on 
decolorization of Red 3BN by B. cereus and B. megaterium.  
Percentage decolorization of the dye recorded for B. cereus  
when beef extract was used as nitrogen source was 7 .69% and 
that for B. megaterium was 11,54%.  The percentage of 
decolorization of Red 3BN with peptone as nitrogen source was 
found to be 66.67% and 57,41%,  respectively for B. cereus and   
B. megaterium.   When the yeast extract was used as nitrogen 
source 62.5% decolorization of the dye was recorded  with both 
the bacterial species. From the above data it is ob served that B. 
cereus is more efficient in decolorizing Red-3BN than B.  
megaterium and  peptone is the ideal nitrogen source for its 
activity under invitro condition.  
 
Figure-4 illustrates the effect of different temper ature on 
decolorization of Red 3BN by B. cereus and B. megaterium.  
Percentage decolorization of the dye recorded for B. cereus  at 
27 oC was 50.12% and that for B. megaterium  was 55.25%.  The 
percentage of decolorization of Red 3BN at 37 oC was found to 
be 60% and 65.12%, respectively for B. cereus and B. 
megaterium.  From the above data it is observed that B. 
megaterium is more efficient in decolorizing Red 3BN than B. 
cereus   and 37 oC is the ideal temperature for its activity under 
in vitro condition.      
 
Figure-5 illustrates the effect of different pH on decolorization 
of Red 3BN by B. cereus and B. megaterium.  Percentage 
decolorization of the dye recorded for both B. cereus  and B. 
megaterium  at pH 5 was 20.69%.  Decolorization of Red 3BN at 
pH 6 was found to be 31.82% and 68.18%, respectively  for B. 
cereus and B. megaterium.  The percentage of decolorization of 
Red 3BN at pH 7 was found to be 42.59% and 51.85%,  
respectively for B. cereus and B. megaterium. When the cultures 
were maintained at pH 8, 12% and 30% decolorization  of the 
dye was recorded in cultures of B. cereus and B. megaterium 
respectively. From the above data it can be inferre d that B. 
megaterium is more efficient in decolorizing Red 3BN than B. 
cereus and pH 6 is the ideal for its activity under in vit ro 
condition.  
 
Figure-6 illustrates the effect of different volume  of inoculum  
on decolorization of Red 3BN by B. cereus and  B. megaterium.  
Percentage decolorization of the dye recorded for B. cereus  for 
2% inoculum was 65.28% and that for B. megaterium  was 
63.45%.  The percentage decolorization of Red 3BN w ith 4% 
inoculum was found to be 70.12% and 66.65%, respect ively for 
B. cereus and B. megaterium.  The percentage decolorization of 
Red 3BN with 6% inoculum was found to be 66.42% and  
62.45% respectively for B. cereus and B. megaterium. The 
percentage decolorization of the dye recorded for B. cereus  with 8% inoculum was 75.32% and that for B. megaterium  was 
68.65%.   When 10% inoculums was used 69.43% and 70.85%  
decolorization of the dye was recorded in cultures of  B. cereus 
and  B. megaterium  respectively. From the above data it is 
observed that B. cereus is more efficient in decolorizing Red 
3BN than B. megaterium and 8% inoculum is the ideal volume 
for its activity under in vitro condition. 
 
Figure-7 illustrates the Time course of dye decolor ization of 
Red 3BN under optimum conditions by B. cereus and B. 
megaterium.  Percentage decolorization of the dye recorded for 
B. cereus  was 93.64%  at 1% sucrose  0.25% peptone,  pH 7,  
37 oC and 8% inoculum and that for B. megaterium  was 96.88%  
at  glucose  1% ,  0.25% yeast extract, pH 6, 37 oC and 10% 
inoculum.  
 
The outcomes of this experiment indicated that B. megaterium  
performed the decolorization process to a better ex tent than B. 
cereus  under a combination of the ideal levels of all fac tors 
influencing the process. However, both the species of bacteria 
can be inferred as good agents for the degradation of Red 3BN. 
 
Azo dyes represent one of the recalcitrant chemical s not being 
degraded by conventional effluent treatment process es 29 . 
Bacteria have been recognized as an important and e fficient 
agent for the degradation and decolorization of  te xtile dyes 10-12 . 
B. cereus  has been  reported to decolorize different azo dye s 
from textile effluent.  Modi et al. 30   have reported maltose and 
peptone as the ideal carbon and  nitrogen sources r espectively 
for efficient decolorization of Reactive Red 195 by   B. cereus, 
recording  97%  reduction in color of the dye in th e effluent. In 
another study Ola et. al.31 , have reported decolorization of 
Cibacron red P4B and Cibacron black PSG to the leve ls 81% 
and 75% respectively by this species. Further the s tudy 31  has 
reported requirement of different carbon and nitrog en sources 
for maximum decolorization of the two dyes.   The c urrent study 
has revealed 93.64% decolorization of Red 3BN with sucrose 
and peptone as ideal carbon and nitrogen sources re spectively.   
From the above outcomes of different studies, it ca n be inferred 
that the metabolic flux of B. cereus  alters with the type of 
carbon and nitrogen sources available in the surrou nding 
environment and efficiency of decolorization of the  azo dyes is 
greatly dependent on these factors.  
 
Degradation and decolorization of the wide range of  azo dyes 
has been reported by different researchers 32-35  who confirmed 
the role of the bacterial enzyme azoreductase in cl eavage of the 
dye leading to its decolorization. In another study  Tripathi and 
Srivastava 29  have confirmed 94.4% decolorization of another 
azo dye, orange G by B. megaterium  and predicted 
decolorization at ideal conditions using statistica l tools, central 
composite design (CCD). The current study has demon strated 
the decolorization of Red 3BN by this species and t he level of 
decolorization was found to be 96.88% at optimum co nditions 
of key parameters analyzed. Therefore, it can be co ncluded that 
B. megaterium  is a highly potential bacterial species capable of  
degrading and decolorizing wide range of azo dyes. International Research Journal of Biological Scienc es ________________________________________________  ISSN 2278-3202
