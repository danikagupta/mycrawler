Abstract:  Laccases are multicopper -containing oxidases (EC 1.10.3.2.) and they are widely found in fungi, higher plants 
and bacteria. Because of their high pH stability and thermostability, laccases from this strain have a potential for the 
treatment of  textile bleaching effluents. In this research, the thermophilic test strain isolated from the Manikaran thermal 
springs, in Himachal Pradesh, were subjected to analysis of 16S rRNA sequence. The obtained sequence data were 
compared with data from the data base in the Genbank and as a result it has been identified that this organism is a member 
of Geobacillus  genus (GenBank number KC515152). The laccase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  MS5 was purified 
by using precipitate of saturation (NH 4)2SO 4, DEAE -cellulose and Sephacryl S200 and the molecular mass of the enzyme 
were determined by SDS -PAGE.  It has been depicted that purified laccase enzyme preparations can degrade textile dyes 
successfully, playing a significant role in the bioremediation of sy nthetic dyes, thus can be used further for 
bioremediation of industrial effluents.

INTRODUCTION  
Laccases (benzenediol: oxygen -
oxidoreductase; EC: 1.10.3.2) are multicopper enzymes  
that catalyse the oxidation of phenols, polyphenols, 
aromatic amines and different non -phenolic substrates 
by using molecular oxygen from the air as an electron 
acceptor  [1, 2]. Industrially important laccase enzyme 
p-diphenol, dioxygen oxidoreductase belongs t o a gene 
family named as the blue -copper proteins of the 
oxidases [3]  and is produced by 4 type of living 
organisms including bacteria, insects, higher plants and 
fungi [4]. Although fungal and bacterial laccases have 
similar structures, their amino acid s equences are quite 
different [5] . In addition, bacterial laccases often occur 
as monomers, whereas certain fungal laccases occur as 
isoenzymes that normally oligomerize to form 
multimeric complexes [5][6].  So far, very few bacterial 
origin laccase enzymes have been purified and 
characterized. The first study on this subject is the 
prokaryotic laccase which was derived from the 
Azospirillum lipoferum , a rizospheric bacterium. In this 
bacterium it was determined that the enzyme was 
composed of a catalytic sub unit and is a multimeric 
enzyme, consisting of 1 or 2 larger chains [7].  
 In recent years, bacterial laccases have gained 
increasing attention for their potential in biodegrading 
environmentally important phenolic pollutants because 
of their relatively hig h production rate, high 
thermostability, and wider pH range, among others  [8, 
9]. Laccase enzyme was purified from the 
Marinomonas  mediterranea , which is a melanogenic 
marine bacterium. It has also been determined that these 
bacteria produce two different polyphenol oxidase s, 
capable of oxidizing the substrates of both laccases and 
tyrosinases [7]. Ruijssenaars and Hartmans [10]  have 
identified a protein of Bacillus halodurans as a potential 
bacterial laccase. There are very few studies performed 
with therm ophilic bacteria. Recent studies have been 
conducted with thermophilic organisms including 
Laccase derived from Streptomyces lavendula REN -7 
[11], laccase -like protein derived from Pyrobaculum 
aerophilum IM2, which is a thermophilic archaea [12],  
laccase 3 1-like protein derived from Aquifex aeolicus 
VF5 which is a hyperthermophilic bacterium [13]  and 
laccase derived from Thermus  thermophilus [7, 14]. 
Other bacterial laccases have been described in 
Azospirillum lipoferum, Escherichia coli, Bacillus 
lichenifo rmis, Bacillus halodurans, Streptomyces 
coelicolor, Thermus thermophilus and g -

 Proteobacterium JB, to mention the most relevant 
examples [7, 15, 16]. 
 
Laccase mediated catalysis occurs with 
reduction of oxygen to water, accompanied by the 
oxidation of subs trate. Laccases thus oxidize 
polyphenols, methoxysubstituted phenols, aromatic 
diamines and a range of other compounds [17]. 
Consequently, it is possible to use the laccase enzyme 
in many industrial areas such as the removal of textile 
dyes, phenols remova l and waste detoxification, since it 
does not have the substrate specificity. Dye effluents 
from the textile industry represent a major 
environmental pollutant and conventional degradation 
processes suffer from inefficiency, are not price 
competitive or re sult in toxic by -products [17-20]. To 
date, only fungal laccases are industrially relevant for 
the detoxification of synthetic dyes and other 
applications owing to their higher redox potential 
compared to bacterial laccases [7, 21, 22]. However, 
more recen tly bacterial laccases have also been shown 
to successfully oxidize dyes in the presence and absence 
of redox mediators  [15, 23, 24]. Developing bacterial 
laccases for biotechnological applications will be 
advantageous because they are sustainable and can be 
produced in a short time in inexpensive media.  
 
For this reason, purification and 
characterization of the laccase enzyme produced by 
Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  MS5 (Genbank number 
KC 414152) which were isolated in the Manikaran 
thermal spring of Hima chal Pradesh and investigating 
the usability of this enzyme in removing textile dyes in 
wastewater were aimed in this study.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Sampling  
 Samples in the form of water, soil, pebbles and rock 
mattings from different sites of Manikaran hot water 
spring were collected in sterilized screw capped vials 
and jars, which were kept in an icebox immediately 
during sampling and brought to the laboratory and kept 
at 4oC in refrigerator till further processing. The 
temperature and pH were recorded at the time of 
sampling.  
 
Isolation of strain   
The thermophilic bacterial strain used in this study 
was isolated from Manikaran Hot water spring of 
Himachal Pradesh. The water temperature of this hot 
spring was around 95°C. All the samples were enriched 
on Nutrient Broth and then incubated in covered water 
bath incubator shaker at 60°C for 24 -48 hours. Enriched 
samples were spread on Nutrient Agar medium plates 
and the plates were incubated at 60°C for 24 -48 hours.  
Individual colonies were streaked and res treaked 
repeatedly and the axenic cultures were stored at 4oC 
till further experimentation.  
 Qualitative and quantitative screening for laccase 
activity  
 All the thrermophilic bacterial isolates were further 
screened for laccase activity by both qualitativ e and 
quantitative methods. The culture supernatant was 
obtained by centrifugation of overnight cultures of 
selected bacterial isolate at 10,000 x g, 40C for 10 mins 
and used as crude extracellular enzyme. Crude 
extracellular enzyme preparation was used fo r both 
qualitative as well as quantitative assays.  
 
Qualitative determination of laccase activity  
Plate assay is a rapid determination of the 
presence of laccase enzyme. Fifteen ml of sterile agar 
containing 1.0% dimethoxy phenol was poured into 
petriplate s and after solidification wells of appropriate 
size were made. Hundered µl of crude enzyme extract 
was added to first well and commercial laccase enzyme 
was added to the second well followed by incubation at 
600C for 12 -24 hrs. Orange coloured zone would be 
formed due to the oxidation of substrate which 
interprets laccase activity.  
 
Quantitative determination of laccase activity  
Laccase activity was measured by monitoring 
the oxidation of ABTS  [25, 26]. Catalase was added to 
the assay solution and incubated for 1 hour at 600C to 
remove the possible effect of H 2O2 produced by the 
bacteria. Laccase activity was determined 
spectrophotometrically at 420 nm with ABTS as a 
substrate. The reaction mixture contained 200µl 
aliquots of crude extracellular enz yme preparation and 
0.2 mM ABTS in 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) 
making final volume to 1.0 ml. The reaction was held at 
600C for 10 mins followed by addition of 0.5 ml of 80% 
trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. One unit of 
enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required 
to oxidize 1.0 µmol of ABTS per min. The molar 
extinction coefficient of ABTS was found to be 36,000 
M-1 cm-1.  
 
Morphological and biochemical characterizations of 
laccase producing thermophilic bacterial isolate  
 Selected thermophilic bacterial isolate was 
studied for  various morphological characteristics viz., 
colour, gram reaction, shape, spore formation and 
motility [27] . Various biochemical tests were carried 
out for the biochemical characterization of selected  
bacterial isolates viz., catalase test, urease test, oxidase 
test, indole test, citrate test, MR -VP test and 
fermentation of sugars [28, 29]. All the biochemical test 
reagents  were procured from Himedia, Mumbai 
(India).  
 
Genomic DNA extraction  
Thermophil ic bacterial culture was inoculated 
into 20ml Nutrient broth and incubated at 600C 
overnight. Cultures were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 
min, cell pellets were washed two times with distilled

 water, then used for DNA isolation using Genomic 
DNA extractio n Mini -Kit (Real Genomics) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene  
The PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene 
from purified genomic DNA was carried ou t in 0.2 ml 
PCR tubes with 20µl reaction volume by using 
univer sal primers viz., forward primer (5’ -
GGTCAGCGGCGGACGGGTGAGTAAC -3’) and the 
reverse primer (5’ -
GACGGGCGGTGTGTACAGAGGCCCG -3’)  and all 
the amplifications were performed using thermal cycler 
(MultiGene PCR system, Labnet). PCR and molecular 
biology reagents w ere procured from Bangalore Genei, 
(Bangalore) and primers were custom -synthesized and 
supplied in lyophilized form by Integrated DNA 
Technologies Inc., USA.  
 
Sequencing analysis  
The PCR products obtained through 
amplification with universal primers targeting  rRNA 
gene were sequenced, using same upstream and 
downstream primers, by a commercial sequencing 
facility (Xcleris lab). The sequence of the bacterial 
isolate after sequencing was blasted using online NCBI 
BLAST program, http://www.ncbi.nib.gov/b last [30]. 
Phylogenetic analysis was used for comparative 
genomics to show evolutionary relationships. The 
analysis began with aligning of sequences using tools 
like Clustal W [31]  and after alignment, phylogenetic 
tree was constructed using MEGA software (Molecular 
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) [32].  
 
Optimization of culture conditions for maximum 
laccase production  
 The bacterial isolate selected by quantitative and 
qualitative assays depicting maximum laccase activity 
has further investigated to study  effect of different 
factors such as incubation temperature, pH and  
incubation time on laccase production as well as growth 
of the bacterial isolate. The pH range was optimized at 
60oC for 24 hrs using  NB medium adjusted from 4.0, 
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0  and 10.0 separately and 
temperature range for incubation investigated varied 
from 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90  and 100oC  where as  effect 
of different incubation times for the growth of these  
thermophilic bacteria was studied  for  24, 48, 72, 96, 
120 and 144  hrs. In all cases optical density was 
monitored at 600nm on a double beam UV/VIS 
scanning spectrophotometer.     
 
Purification of Laccase from Geobacillus 
thermocatenulatus  MS5  
 The crude enzyme extract was filtered and 
centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm a nd then the 
ammonium sulphate enzyme homogenate was 
precipitated at 0 -20%, 20 -40%, 40 -60%, 60 -80% and 
80-100% intervals. The ammonium sulfate precipitation table [33]  was followed to calculate the required 
amount of ammonium sulfate to be added in cell fre e 
extract.  Then ammonium sulphate was used to saturate 
the obtained supernatant at 60 -80%. After dissolving 
the precipitate in 100mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), it 
was dialyzed against the same buffer.  
 
Anion exchange chromatography  
 After the suspension obtained by ammonium 
sulphate, precipitation was dialyzed, the 100 mM of 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and previously equilibrated 
DEAE -cellulose ion exchange column (2.5 x 30) were 
studied. The column was washed until the eluate protein 
detection fails with t he same buffer. Following this, 
NaCl gradient from 0 up to 1 M was applied to elute the 
proteins attached to the column. The flow rates of the 
collected fractions were 3 ml with a 3ml/min. The 
absorbance of protein elution was 
spectrophotometrically measur ed at 280 nm using 
ABTS  substrate to measure the activity in the fractions. 
The active fractions were pooled (combined) and 
allowed to stand at 4°C.  
 
Gel filtration chromatography  
 Using an Amicon membrane concentrator with a 10 
kDa cut off, the active fra ctions which have been 
obtained from anion exchange column were combined, 
dialyzed, desalted and concentrated. Obtained enzyme 
solution was applied to Sephacryl S -200 column (120 
cm × 1 cm), which has been pre -equilibrated with 100 
mM of phosphate buffer ( pH:6.5) having 0.5 M NaCl 
and later the enzyme has been obtained with the very 
same buffer. And all of fractions have been analyzed as 
stated above. And for later use, the active fractions have 
been combined, concentrated and allowed to stand at 
4°C. 
 
Protein concentration  
 The protein concentration was determined 
spectrophotometrically with an absorbance at 280 nm in 
addition to the Bradford's method [34] using Bovine 
Serum Albumin (BSA) as a standard.  
 
Determination of laccase activity  
 The laccase ac tivity has been determined using 
ABTS substrate [25, 26]. The reaction mixture was 
prepared by adding 0.5 mL of the enzyme solution on 
top of the ABTS (3 mM) substrate dissolved in 0.5 mL 
of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH = 4.5) and then it was 
incubated at 60°C . The oxidation of ABTS was 
determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 
420 nm. And the one unit of a laccase activity was 
defined as the required amount of enzyme to oxidize 1 
μmol of ABTS/min (ε420 = 36,000 M-1 cm-1) [35].  
 
Characterization of  purified laccase enzyme  
 In the characterization the purified laccase enzyme 
involved determination of  molecular weight of laccase 
enzyme using SDS -PAGE in addition to effect of

    482 
 
 
 different factors such as temperature and pH its activity 
and stability was studied.  
 
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  
 SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified 
laccase of Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  MS5 isolate 
was performed by using Mini Dual Gel Electrophoresis 
System (Atto Corporation, Japan) in 10% 
polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis method which was 
defined by Laemmli [36].  Gel was stained with 
Coomassie brilliant blue G -250 and destained with 10% 
methanol and 10% acetic acid  The standard protein was 
used as protein molecular weight marker  for SDS -
PAGE for e stimation of molecular size of polypeptides 
of laccase of the selected isolate.  
  
Effect of different factors  
 To find out the optimum pH for laccase enzyme 
activity, a pH range of 4.0 -10 was investigated. The 
effect of temperature on enzyme activity was 
investigated within the range of 30 -80°C at a pH of 4.6.  
The activity was measured using standard ABTS assay.  
 
Remediation of some textile dyes  
 In this study, it was investigated that whether the 
purified laccase enzyme can be used in the removal of 
some  dyes used in industry or not. For this purpose, 
RBBR, Indigo carmine, Congo red, Brilliant green and 
Bromophenol blue were used as five different dyes. All 
the dyes were solubilised in distilled water to the final 
concentration of 50 mg/l. The reaction mi xture (6.0 ml) 
contained 2.0 ml acetate buffer (pH: 4.6), 2.0 ml of 
individual dye solution and 2.0 ml of  laccase enzyme 
followed by incubation at 600C for 3 -10 hrs. Control 
samples were run in parallel without addition of crude 
extract/laccase enzyme and  one sample containing 
commercial laccase from Trametes  (SIGMA chemicals) 
was also run to compare the decolourization efficiency. 
The decolourization percentage was determined 
spectrophotometrically as the relative decrease of 
absorbance at each maximal ab sorbance wavelength of 
the dyes. All reactions were performed in triplicates.  
Dye decolourisation was expressed in terms of 
percentage calculated according to the equation.  
 
Where, A 0 is an absorbance at an appropriate 
wavelength of the dye immediately measured after 
adding the enzyme solution and A t is an absorbance 
after each time intervals.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 In this present study, thermophilic bacterial strain 
was  isolated from Manikaran hot water spring of 
Himachal Pradesh and subjected to a range of 
morphological and biochemical tests. It was revealed in 
the results that test strain was gram -positive, catalase 
and oxidase positive where as rest of biochemical descriptors viz., amylase test, urease test, MR -VP test 
and fermentation of sugars w ere found to be negative  
and also is of type endospore forming and mobile rod. 
The optimal conditions observed for the maximum 
growth of selected  thermophilic bacterial isolate, from 
Manikaran thermal spring, were found to temperature 
range of  60oC-65oC, optimal pH range of  6.0 -8.0 and 
optimal time 96 hours. These findings comply with the 
criteria of thermophilic bacteria which were living at 
temperatures higher than 50°C [37]. The 16S rDNA of 
the isolates was amplified by using the forward primer 
(5’-GGTCAGCGGCGGACGGGTGAGTAAC -3’) and 
the reverse primer (5’ -
GACGGGCGGTGTGTACAGAGGCCCG -3’). 1151 
nucleotides of 16S rRNA from the test isolate (MS5) 
were aligned to compare with the sequences of the 
related bacteria. Stackebrandt and Goebel [38]  have 
concluded that the strains belonging to the same genus, 
which were exhibiting less than 97% 16S rRNA gene 
sequence similarity, should be considered as the 
members of different species. The isolate (MS5) has 
exhibited 99% resemblance to Geobacillus , according 
to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis [37] . The strain 
MS5 GenBank accession number is KC515152. 16S 
rRNA sequence analysis method was found inadequate 
to reveal the distinction between the species which are 
in a very close relationship with each othe r, however, it 
was found adequate for identification at the genus level 
again in the same literature [37].  Therefore, these data 
should be supported with more advanced genomic 
analysis methods which allow identification at a strain 
level.  
 
Purification and  characterization of laccase enzyme 
from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  (MS5)  
 The laccase enzyme was  purified from the 
Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  (MS5)  bacteria  
extracellularly in 3 steps as the ammonium sulphate  
precipitation, DEAE -cellulose and Sephac ryl S200 gel  
filtration chromatography. All purification steps of the  
laccase enzyme are shown in table 1.  The ammonium 
sulphate saturation of the laccase enzyme  in the range 
of 0 -90% was determined in the first step.  Laccase 
enzyme was precipitated in the  60-80% range  which 
exhibits the highest rate of precipitation and purified 
3.85 times with a 38.2% yield and applied to DEAE 
cellulose ion exchange column. Enzyme had a peak at 
DEAE cellulose ion exchange column in the second 
step and further purified 13. 1 times with a 34.8% yield. 
And in  the last step, the enzyme fraction was obtained 
and concentrated from the ion exchange column applied 
to the Sephacryl S 200 column. A single peak was 
obtained and 1535 EU/mg protein specific activity was 
reached with the  93.03 times purification and 30.6% 
yield. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 
carried out to determine the purity as well as molecular 
weight of laccase enzyme. The sodium dodecyl sulphate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS -PAGE) 
analysis reve aled that the laccase enzyme consists of 2

 subunits of sizes 42.5 kDa and 65 kDa (Fig.  1). An 
optimum pH was found to be 4.0 -5.0 and optimum temperature was found to 55 -600C for maximum 
laccase enzyme activity.

Dye decolourization by crude and partially purified 
laccase  
Purified  laccase enzyme was also investigated 
for dye decolourization ability of selected five different 
dyes. In case of indigo carmine dye, it was found that 
50% of decolourization occurred after 2 hrs of 
incubation and then after 4 hours of incubation, 99% of 
decolourization was observed. Similarly in case of 
congo red dye, 60% of decolourization was measured 
after 6 hrs of incubation and it decolourized up to 99% 
after 32 hrs of incubation. In case of RBBR, 40% of 
decolourization was determined after 12 hrs of 
incubation and then it increased slowly up to 98% after 
32 hrs of incubation. The rest of two dyes, bromophenol 
blue and brilliant green were found to show lesser  decolourization comparatively. Percent decolourization 
of 70% and 60% was observed in bromop henol blue 
and brilliant green dyes, respectively even after 48 hrs 
of incubation (Fig . 2, Table 1). The methyl or methoxy 
groups bound on the phenolic groups in the azo dye 
structure give electrons and hence increase the activity 
of laccase enzyme, wherea s the nitro groups in the 
structure attract electrons and hence inhibit the 
oxidation reaction catalyzed by the laccase enzyme [39, 
40]. Thus it was observed that crude as well as purified 
enzyme preparation also have ability to effectively 
degrade the tex tile dyes.   The findings are in line with 
the findings obtained from the removal of azo dyes 
from the wastewater [41].

CONCLUSION  
The results suggest that the laccase enzyme 
purified from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus  MS5  is of 
very higher catalytic activity and are economic, highly 
stable at different temperatures and pH levels and can 
be used widely and effectively in the removal o f the 
dyes that cause environmental pollution.
