Abstract 22 
This is the Pre-Published Version. 2The oxidative degradation of azo dye, ora nge G (OG), in aqueous solution by the 23 
persulfate/Fe2+ reagent has been investigated. Effect s of pH, dosages of persulfate and 24 
Fe2+, temperature, and the pres ence of inorganic ions (Cl, NO 3, HCO 3 and H 2PO 4) 25 
on the OG degradation were examined in batch experiments. OG degradation by the 26 
persulfate/Fe2 reagent was found to follow the firs t-order kinetic model. Under an 27 
optimum condition ([persulfate] = 4 mM, [Fe2+] = 4 mM and pH 3.5), the OG in 28 
aqueous solution with an ini tial concentration of 0.1 mM was degraded by 99% within 29 
30 min. The OG degradation increased w ith the increased persulfate and Fe2+ dosages 30 
and an optimal molar ratio of persulfate to Fe2+ was found to be 1:1. The experimental 31 
results showed that increasing the reacti on temperature was be neficial to the OG 32 
degradation, not as efficient as chemical activation. In the meantime, the apparent 33 
activation energy for the OG degradati on was determined to be 92.2 kJ mol−1. 34 
Furthermore, the experiments demonstrat ed that the OG degradation could be 35 
significantly inhibited due to the existen ce of inorganic ions in a sequence of NO 3 < 36 
Cl < H 2PO 4 < HCO 3. The results of this study pr ovided fundamental understanding of 37 
the OG reaction with the persulfate/Fe2+ reagent.  38

1. Introduction 44  3Azo dyes represent more than 50% of all dyes in common use because of their 45 
chemical stability and versat ility [1]. However, most of them are non-biodegradable, 46 
toxic and potentially carcinogenic in natu re [2] and at present are abated by some 47 
non-destructive processes, such as coa gulation, activated carbon adsorption and 48 
membrane filtration [3-5]. The degradation and mineralization of dyes have not been 49 
achieved in these treatment processes. Th erefore, the development of destructive 50 
processes for treating dyeing wastewater ha s significant interests currently. Several 51 
advanced oxidation processes, such as TiO 2-mediated photocatalysis [6-8], Fenton or 52 
photo-Fenton reaction [9-11], and other r eactions using potassium permanganate 53 
[12,13], oxone/Co2+ reagent [14,15] and persulfate [16,17], have been extensively 54 
studied  in the degradation of dye solutions . Actually, the persulfa te technique for the 55 
efficient degradation of  biorefractory substa nces has been successfully verified  for some 56 
pollutants [18-23] and furthermore, it has potential to completely mineralize organic 57 
compounds. 58 
Persulfate (S 2O82) is one of the strongest oxidan ts known in aqueous solution and 59 
has the higher potential ( Eo = 2.01 V) than H 2O2 (Eo = 1.76 V). It offers some 60 
advantages over other oxidants as a solid ch emical at ambient temperature with ease of 61 
storage and transport, high stability, high aque ous solubility and relatively low cost [20]. 62 
These features let it be a promising choice  for clean-up applications. Reactions of 63 
persulfate with organic pollutants in water,  however, are generally slow at ambient 64 
temperature, and activation of persulfate is necessary to accelerate the process. It has 65 
been reported that persulfate anion can thermally or chemically by transition metal ions, 66  4such as Fe2+ be activated to generate a str ong oxidant sulfate free radical (SO 4, Eo = 67 
2.5-3.1 V) [16]. Similar to the Fenton’s reaction,  the transition metal is coupled with an 68 
oxidant. The overall stoichiometric reaction between persulfate and Fe2+ is expressed by 69 
Eq (1) through two steps of Eqs (2) and (3) as follows [24]:  70 
S2O82 + 2Fe2  2Fe3 + 2SO 4●                                     ( 1 )  71 
S2O82 + Fe2  Fe3 + SO 42 + SO 4●       ( k = 27 M1s1)                ( 2 )  72 
Fe2 + SO 4●  Fe3 + SO 42               ( k = 3.0 × 108 M1s1)          ( 3 ) 73 
Orange G (OG), a typical azo dye in textile  wastewaters, has been the subject of 74 
intense investigations [1 1,25,26]. However, the information about OG degradation by 75 
the persulfate/Fe2+ reagent is still limited. In this study, the kinetics of OG degradation 76 
was elucidated based on the experimental da ta. Furthermore, the influences of some 77 
important reaction conditions such as pH of solutions, dos ages of persulfate and Fe2+, 78 
temperature, and presence of some inorga nic ions on OG degradation in aqueous 79 
solution were investigated. Furthermore the mineralization of OG by the persulfate/Fe2+ 80 
reagent was compared with the Fenton reagent.  81

2. Experimental 83 
 84 
2.1. Materials 85 
OG chemical was purchased from Hengrun dyestuff chemical Co. (Guangzhou, 86 
China) and was used as received without  further purificati on. Its physiochemical 87 
characteristics are listed in Table 1. Sodium persulfate (Na 2S2O8, 99%) and ferrous 88  5sulfate (FeSO 4·7H 2O) were obtained from Aldric h. Sodium chloride, sodium 89 
dihydrogen phosphate, sodium bicarbonate and sodi um nitrate were purchased from J.T. 90 
Baker. Other reagents with analytical reag ent grade were obtained from International 91 
Laboratory (IL, USA). 92 
Aqueous solutions were prepared in the deionized water obtained from a Millipore 93 
Milli-Q system. An OG stock solu tion was prepared at 10 mM. A Na 2S2O8 solution was 94 
prepared at 200 mM freshly. A FeSO 4 solution (100 mM) was prepared in 0.01 M 95 
H2SO 4.  96 
 97 
2.2. Experimental procedures 98 
Batch experiments were first performed in graduated and plugged test tubes. 99 
Reaction solutions were obtained by adding FeSO 4 solution into aqueous OG solution 100 
and the initial pH of the reaction solutions was adjusted with NaOH (0.1 M) or H 2SO 4 101 
(0.1 M) solution. Then the reaction was initiated by adding Na 2S2O8 into the prepared 102 
reaction solutions with a vol ume of 50 ml. At the given time intervals, the sample 103 
aliquots were taken from the tubes and anal yzed immediately. Before analysis, sodium 104 
azide [20] was added to quenc h any further oxidation reac tions and the water samples 105 
were then filte red through a 0.45 μm membrane filter. All expe riments were carried out 106 
at a room temperature of 20  1 C unless otherwise stated. 107 
Several sets of the experiments were conduc ted to determine the effects of various 108 
parameters on OG degradation. In all experiments, the initial OG concentration was 109 
kept at 0.1 mM. For determining the effect of  pH on OG degradation, three pH va lues of 110  6aqueous solutions at 3.5, 7.0 and 9.0 were studied, respectively. In the remaining 111 
experiments, the pH values of the solutions were kept constant at 3.5. To determine the 112 
effects of persulfate and Fe2 dosages on the OG degradation, the ratios of 113 
[persulfate]/[Fe2] at 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 and 10:1 with [Fe2] = 1 mM were conducted. 114 
After the optimal dosage of persulfate was obtained, the concentration of Fe2 was 115 
changed with a fixed concentration of persulfa te. To determine the effect of temperature 116 
on OG degradation, temperature varied from 29 3 to 313 K in different experiments. To 117 
investigate the effects of co-existin g inorganic ions on OG degradation, the 118 
concentrations of NaCl, NaNO 3, NaHCO 3 and NaH 2PO 4 ranged from 1 to 100 mM were 119 
studied, respectively.  120 
 121 
2.3. Chemical analysis 122 
The concentration of OG in aqueous solution was analyzed by UV-vis 123 
spectrophotometry (PerkinElmer, Lambda 20)  at a maximum absorption wavelength of 124 
478 nm. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentr ation was measured by a TOC analyzer 125 
(Shimadzu TOC-5000A) after fi ltering the samples by the 0.45 μm filter. The 126 
concentration of Fe2 was determined colorimetrically using a UV-vis 127 
spectrophotometer at 510 nm after adding  1,10-phenanthroline to form a colored 128 
complex of Fe2-phenanthroline [27]. Persulfate ion was determined by iodometric 129 
titration with sodium thiosulfate [28]. The da ta presented in this work were obtained 130 
from duplicate experiments and the errors of measurement were estimated to be within 131 
5%. 132  7 133 
3. Results and discussion 134 
 135 
3.1. Kinetics of OG degradation 136 
The reaction of OG degradation with the persulfate/Fe2 reagent versus reaction 137 
time is presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen  that the spectrum of light absorption by OG 138 
solution before reaction consists of three main peaks at 259, 328, and 478 nm plus a 139 
shoulder peak at 421 nm. While the peak s at 259 and 328 nm are assigned to its 140 
aromatic rings, the peaks at 478 nm and the shoulder at 421 nm are assigned to the 141 
conjugated structure formed by the azo bond [29]. As the reaction proceeded, the two 142 
characteristic absorption peaks at 328 and 478 nm decreased dramatically and almost 143 
disappeared after 30 min, showing th at the chromophore and conjugated * system 144 
were completely destroyed. On the other ha nd, the peak at 259 nm  declined slowly, 145 
indicating that the aromatic rings were stil l present. In this study, the variation of 146 
absorption peak at 478 nm wa s applied to evaluate the ex tent of OG degradation. The 147 
plot of ln ( C0/C) versus time (inset of Fig. 1) show s a linear relationship, indicating that 148 
the OG degradation follows the fi rst-order kinetic model below: 149 
C = C0 exp( kobst)                                                    ( 4 )  150 
where C is the concentration of OG at time t; C0 is the initial concentration of OG and 151 
kobs is the observed reaction rate constant.  152 
In the inset of Fig. 1, the rate consta nt of OG degradation was found to be 0.12 153 
min1 under a suitable condition ([OG] = 0.1 mM, [persulfate] = 4 mM, [Fe2] = 4 mM, 154  8pH 3.5).  155 
 156 
3.2. Effect of pH 157 
The pH value of aqueous solution plays a significant role in the degradation of 158 
organic compounds. Three expe riments of OG degradation with the persulfate/Fe2 159 
reagent were carried out at initial pH 3.5, 7.0 and 9.0, respectively. The first-order 160 
kinetic rate constants for the OG degradati on with different pH values were obtained 161 
and are shown in Table 2. With the increase  of pH, the efficiency of OG degradation 162 
decreased (Fig. 2), indicating th at the acidic pH is more fa vorable to the OG degradation 163 
than neutral and alkaline pH. The decreased OG degradation in the neutral and alkaline 164 
media might result from th e precipitation of iron (Fe2+ and Fe3+). This result agreed with 165 
our earlier reports on the Fenton’s reagents [9,30]. The soluble Fe2 species is stable 166 
between a wide pH range of 2.0 to 9.0, while Fe3 precipitation occurs at pH > 4.0 [30]. 167 
It has been known that when the pH value of the aqueous so lution is higher than 4.0, the 168 
amount of soluble Fe2 could be decreased due to the formation of Fe2 complexes 169 
which hinder the further reaction of Fe2 with persulfate. The reaction can be described 170 
by the Eq. (5) [31]: 171 
Fe2+ + H 2O → FeOH+ + H+                    ( k = 1.9 s1)                 ( 5 )  172 
On the other hand, the precipitated Fe3 oxyhydroxides, such as FeOH2+, 173 
Fe2(OH) 24+, Fe(OH) 2+, Fe(OH) 30 and Fe(OH) 4 [31], have low efficiency to activate 174 
persulfate and to produce the sulfat e radicals. The formations of Fe3 oxyhydroxides are 175 
shown in Eqs. ((6)-(8)) below: 176  9Fe3+ + H 2O → FeOH2+ + H+               ( k = 2.3× 107 s1)              ( 6 )  177 
Fe3+ + 2H 2O → Fe(OH) 2+ + 2H+               ( k = 4.7× 103 s1)              ( 7 )  178 
2Fe3++ 2H 2O → Fe 2(OH) 24+ + 2H+          ( k = 1.1× 107 s1)              ( 8 )  179 
Both aspects are favored at high pH, and th is precipitation could be experimentally 180 
confirmed by the production of turbidity at pH 7.0. Therefore, at high pH, the low 181 
activity of the catalyst leads to decrease the amounts of ra dicals, and then decreased 182 
efficiency of OG degradation. In addition, th e self-dissociation of the oxidant through 183 
non-radical pathways at high pH might be  another reason causing the decreased 184 
efficiency of OG degradation. The feature of optimal pH ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 is a 185 
characteristic of the Fenton reagent. A recent study by Rastogi et  al. [32] on the 186 
degradation of polychlor inated biphenyls by Fe2-peroxymonosulfate oxidative system 187 
also confirmed that the higher degradation ef ficiency achieved at acidic pH value. 188 
Therefore in this study the best pH value for the following experiments of OG oxidation 189 
was chosen to be 3.5.  190 
 191 
3.3. Effects of persulfate and Fe2 dosages 192 
Persulfate plays an importa nt role as a source of SO 4● generation in the 193 
persulfate/Fe2 reagent. The effect of persul fate dosage on OG degradation was 194 
examined by varying the ratios of persulfate to Fe2 from 1:1 to 10:1. The experimental 195 
results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. It can be observed that at [Fe2] = 1 mM, 196 
increasing the dosage of persulfate from 1 to 4 mM, equivalent to a [persulfate]/[Fe2] 197 
ratio from 1:1 to 4:1, resulted in an increas e in OG degradation from 53% to 81% within 198  1030 min reaction. However, further incr ease of the persulfate dosage beyond a 199 
[persulfate]/[Fe2] ratio of 4:1 resulted in only a slight increase in the OG removal. For 200 
example, the efficiency of OG degradation at 30 min reaction was achieved by 81% to 201 
82% while the ratio of [persulfate]/[Fe2] was increased from 4:1 to 10:1. This is in 202 
agreement with the observations by other researchers [19,33] who applied Fe2 to 203 
activate persulfate to degrad e other pollutants. This phe nomenon can also be observed 204 
in the Fenton reagent where the excessi ve amount of hydrogen peroxide had a 205 
detrimental effect on the degradation effi ciency [9,30]. Therefor e, in the following 206 
experiments, while the concentration of pers ulfate was kept at 4 mM and the ratio of 207 
[persulfate] to [OG] was 40:1, effect of Fe2 dosage on the OG degradation was studied. 208 
Fe2 is one of the main species that can catalyze persulfate to produce SO 4● 209 
radicals [34] and its existence can infl uence the efficiency of OG degradation 210 
significantly. It should be not ed that OG cannot be effectively oxidized by persulfate 211 
alone. Fig. 4a showed the effect of Fe2 dosage on OG degradation with different molar 212 
ratios of [persulfate]/[Fe2]. When the Fe2 concentration varied from 0.5 to 4 mM 213 
([persulfate]/[Fe2] = 8:1, 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1), the effici ency of OG degradation within 30 214 
min reaction was achieved by 54%, 80%, 94% and 99%, respectively. The higher 215 
efficiency of OG degradation at the higher Fe2 dosage might result from the higher 216 
production of SO 4● in the reaction. However, w ith a further increase of Fe2 217 
concentration up to 8 mM ([persulfate]/[Fe2] = 1:2), the efficiency of OG degradation 218 
was slightly reduced to 98%. It indicates that Fe2 can also act as a sulfate radical 219 
scavenger at its high co ncentration as expresse d by Eq. (3) [31,35].  220  11Similar results have been found in othe r reports [19,33,36]. Therefore, it may be 221 
concluded that while an essential amount of Fe2 is required to effectively activate 222 
persulfate and to generate a sufficient amount  of sulfate radicals in  the reaction solution, 223 
an excess amount of Fe2 would be detrimental to the OG degradation. Furthermore, the 224 
detection of Fe2 (Fig. 4b) indicated that they were consumed quickly and their 225 
concentrations decreased sharply once the reaction was initiated. Under the conditions 226 
that different amounts of Fe2 were added, most of Fe2 were transformed to Fe3 after 227 
several minutes. Therefore, how to  maintain a certain amount of Fe2 in the reaction 228 
solution during a long reaction ti me is a key technique for it s practical app lication. By 229 
employing a suitable complexing agent in conjugation with Fe2, the amount of soluble 230 
Fe2 in the reaction solution can be well controlled even the pH in bulk solution is 231 
neutral. For example, Liang et al. found an enhanced degradation efficiency of 232 
trichloroethylene by the persulfate/Fe2 reagent using ferrous citrate as a catalyst [37].  233 
At the same time, the results shown in Fig. 4c indicated that an increase of Fe2 234 
concentration did result in an increase of persulfate decomposition proportionally, but 235 
no proportional increase of OG removal was achieved. This phenomenon suggests that 236 
sulfate radicals were consumed by some react ions other than with OG, as indicated in 237 
Eqs ((9)-(15)) [35,38,39]: 238 
SO 4● + SO 4●  2SO 42                 ( k = 8.9 × 108 M1s1)          ( 9 ) 239 
SO 4● + H 2O  HSO 4 + ●O H              ( k = 500 s1)                 ( 1 0 )  240 
SO 4● + ●OH  HSO 4 + 1/2O 2                                      ( 1 1 )  241 
●OH + ●OH  H2O2                    ( k = 5.2 × 109 M1s1)          ( 1 2 )  242  12SO 4● + H 2O2  SO 42 + H+ + HO 2●        ( k = 1.2 × 107 M1s1)          ( 1 3 )  243 
SO 4● + HO 2●  SO 42 + H+ + O 2          ( k = 3.5 × 109 M1s1)          ( 1 4 )  244 
SO 4● + S 2O82  S2O8 + SO 42          ( k = 6.1 × 105 M1s1)           ( 1 5 ) 245 
 246 
3.4. Effect of temperature  247 
The effect of temperature on OG degradati on was investigated in a rang of 293-313 248 
K. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that increasing temperature ha d a positive effect on the OG 249 
degradation. The efficiency of OG degr adation within 5 min reaction time was 250 
increased from 76% to 100%, when the temp erature increased from 293 to 313 K. Since 251 
persulfate can also be ther mally activated to produce SO 4● [18,22], another set of 252 
experiments without Fe2+ at different temperatures was conducted and the results are 253 
presented in Table 2. The data s howed that the rate constant, k, of OG degradation by 254 
persulfate without the activ ation of ferrous ions incr eased with the enhanced 255 
temperature, but the k values were still much lo wer than those activated by Fe2. These 256 
results indicate that raising temperature (low er than 323 K) is not an efficient way to 257 
activate persulfate compared to chemical activation. 258 
Furthermore, according to the apparent kinetic rate constant at different 259 
temperatures, the apparent activation ener gy for OG degradation by the persulfate/Fe2 260 
reagent was computed using A rrhenius equation (Eq. (16)). 261 
) exp(RTEAk                                                    ( 1 6 )  262 
where A is the preexponential (o r frequency) factor; E is the apparent activation energy 263 
(J mol−1); R is the ideal gas co nstant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1); T is the reaction absolute 264  13temperature (K).  265 
A good linear relationship was obtained in the Arrhenius plot of ln k versus 1/ T 266 
(inset of Fig. 5). The apparent activati on energy was calculated to be 92.2 kJ mol−1. This 267 
value may indicate that the OG degradation in aqueous solution by the persulfate/Fe2 268 
reagent requires moderate activation ener gy, as the thermal reaction energy has a 269 
normal range of 60-250 kJ mol−1 [40]. Liang et al. [19,21] suggested that it requires a 270 
relatively high activation ener gy of around 108-130 kJ mol−1 to degrade 271 
trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The activation energy of the thermal crack 272 
of the O–O bond of persulfate anion wa s also reported to be 140.2 kJ mol−1 by Kolthoff 273 
and Miller [41]. Huang et al. [42] re ported the activation energy of 26 kJ mol−1 for the 274 
degradation of bisphenol A by UV-activated persulfate. The different values may be due 275 
to the structure of different target com pounds. Compared to all the activation energy 276 
mentioned above, the relative lower value of  the OG degradation in  aqueous solution by 277 
the persulfate/Fe2 reagent implies that such r eaction can be easily achieved. 278 
 279 
3.5. Effect of co-existing inorganic ions 280 
Usually, a great amount of salts are empl oyed in various dyeing processes and the 281 
strength of dissolved inorgani c ions in dyeing wastewater may affect the efficiency of 282 
dye degradation reaction. In this study, the effects of several inorganic ions (NO 3, Cl, 283 
HCO 3 and H 2PO 4) that commonly occur in real dye -containing wastewater on the OG 284 
degradation were examined in a concen tration range of 1 to 100 mM, and the 285 
experimental results ar e given in Table 3. 286  14It can obviously be found from Table 3 that the concentration of inorganic ions had 287 
negative effects on the OG degrad ation with the persulfate/Fe2 reagent. The higher 288 
ionic concentration in the so lutions, the lower reaction rate  of OG degradation occurred. 289 
It might result from a decreased amount of  sulfate radicals due  to the high ionic 290 
concentration. The result is in agreement with other studies [18,43]. It is known that 291 
phosphate and bicarbonate are efficient sc avengers of hydroxyl radicals and the 292 
bicarbonate anions quen ched the hydroxyl radi cals more efficiently than phosphate [44]. 293 
Furthermore, it can also be found that all an ions could inhibit th e reaction rate of OG 294 
degradation and the degree of th eir inhibiting effects can be ranked from low to high in 295 
an order of NO 3 < Cl < H 2PO 4 < HCO 3. 296 
 297 
3.6. Mineralization of OG 298 
Although the OG degradation with the persulfate/Fe2 reagent occurred quickly 299 
within a few minutes, the reduction of TO C was much more slowly than the OG 300 
degradation, which took a few hours. Fig. 6 showed the TOC removals in the OG 301 
solution with different dosages of persulfa te. The rate of TOC removal was positively 302 
related to the persulfate concentration in th e range of 1 to 4 mM. A further increase in 303 
persulfate dosage did not lead to further in crease in TOC removal due to the two-edged 304 
effects of per sulfate on the yi elds of reactive species. On one hand, more persulfate in a 305 
certain range could enhance the OG degrad ation by supplying more sulfate radicals 306 
though reaction (1). On the other hand, excessi ve persulfate would compete with OG for 307 
sulfate radicals thr ough reaction (15) [34]. 308  15Furthermore, the same dosage of hydrogen pe roxide instead of pe rsulfate was used 309 
for comparison. It was found that the TO C reductions in the OG solutions with 310 
hydrogen peroxide/Fe2 as the Fenton’s reagent and the persulfate/Fe2 reagent were 311 
achieved by 53% and 96% in 24 h, respec tively. These results ma y suggest that the 312 
persulfate/Fe2 reagent can degrade OG in aqueous solutions more completely than the 313 
Fenton’s reagent after an extended duration. It has been reported that  the sulfate radical 314 
can completely oxidize the  insecticide lindane [36] and even mineralize PCBs [32]. 315 
Sulfate radicals have a longer half life th an hydroxyl radicals mainly due to their 316 
preference for electron transfer reactions while hydroxyl radicals can participate in a 317 
variety of reactions with equal preference [37,45]. The high oxidation efficiency of the 318 
sulfate radicals, in combination with the slow  rate of consumption of precursor oxidants, 319 
makes sulfate radical-based processes very e ffective for the degradation of recalcitrant 320 
organic compounds. Sulfate radicals normally re act with electron transfer process while 321 
hydroxyl radicals can also reac t via electron-atom abstr action along with electron 322 
transfer process which is less prominent in th eir cases [45]. As argue d by Thendral et al. 323 
[46], the high reactivity of the sulfate radical anion can be  attributed to its redox partner 324 
bisulfate/sulfate ion’s ability as a leaving group. Therefore, such a feature of sulfate 325 
radicals may be beneficial to the applica tion of dyeing wastewater treatment where a 326 
higher degree of mineralization is required.  327

4. Conclusions 329 
 330  16In this work, OG as a model azo dye in aqueous solution was successfully degraded 331 
by the persulfate/Fe2 reagent and it was found that the reaction of OG degradation 332 
follows the first-order kinetic model. Under the optimum c ondition ([OG] = 0.1 mM, 333 
[persulfate] = 4 mM, [Fe2] = 4 mM and pH 3.5), 99% of OG degradation was achieved 334 
in 30 min. The apparent activation energy fo r OG degradation with the persulfate/Fe2 335 
reagent was determined to be 92.2 kJ mol−1. The presence of inorganic ions had 336 
inhibitory effects on the OG degr adation in the sequence of NO 3 < Cl < H 2PO 4 < 337 
HCO 3. The experiments also demonstrated that the persulfate/Fe2 reagent can degrade 338 
OG in aqueous solution to a higher degree than the Fenton’s reagent, which is beneficial 339 
for mineralization of azo dyes.  340
