Abstract . The main purpose of this study is maximizing the utilization of paper waste material and 
decrease its harmful effect. Eleven fungal isolates were selected and tested to assess their cellulolytic 
potential. The isolates13A which were isolated from immature compost showed the highest Cellulolytic 
Index values 0.47 mm. According to the morphological characteristics and the 18S rRNA gene sequence, 
the isolate13A was identified as Aspergillus niger  strain13A. The effect of pH and temperature on growth 
of Aspergillus niger  strain13A and its production of cellulase were investigated, the optimal culture 
conditions was recorded at pH 6.0 after 6 days  of incu bation at 35  °C. Under optimal conditions various 
paper waste materials were used for enzyme production under submerged and solid -state fermentation. 
Maximum production of cellulase by Aspergillus niger  strain13A was shown using kraft brown  bags and 
cardbo ard under solid state fermentation . Aspergillus niger  strain13A exhibited also good degradability 
for a mixture of kraft, cardboard, foolscap and printout paper, under solid state fermentation  resulting  in 
the production of bioorganic material. Results of this study showed that treatment of soil with bioorganic 
materials  demnstrarting  high effective ness in controlling  Fusarium wilt of cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L.) 
could be considered as promising alternative to chemical fungicides.

Introduction  
In recent years, solid wastes (MSW) generated by industrial, commercial, domestic 
and agricultural activities, have become serious environment issues (Joshi et al., 2017) . 
Among all solid waste, waste paper represents 10 -39% of global solid waste, where the 
annual world output of these wastes is nearly 400 -1000 million tons per year (Edjabou 
et al., 2015; Neelamegam et al., 2018; Ozola et al., 2019). Paper waste is defined  as 
waste generally comprised of newspaper, printout paper, packing paper, advertising 
paper, newspaper and cardboard (Fonoll et al., 2016). Almost all waste paper, especially  Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

the formation of leachate and greenhouse gases causing more environmental pollution 
and loss of cellulose resources (Saferi and Yusof, 2013; Su et al., 2017). As renewable 
and abundant resources, many reports  have been focused on the conversion o f paper 
waste into value -added products such as bioethanol, cellulase enzymes and mixed with 
other organic materials for co -composting (Fonoll et al., 2016) . 
Paper products are made from fibers of plant origin, especially wood. Paper wastes 
materials are m ainly composed of cellulose 40 -80%, hemicellulose 5 -15% and slight 
amounts o f lignin (Sun and Cheng, 2002). This rich content of cellulose  gives these 
wastes a significant potential as  cheaper  fermentation  substrates for cellulase production 
compared with avicel and carboxymethylcellulose . Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in 
waste paper  produce s glucose , which is also used in the biofuel production process  (Wu 
and Cheng, 2005; Zapata et al., 2018).  
In nature, cellulolytic microorgani sms play an important role in bi odegradation 
process of lignocellulosic  materials. Cellulase  enzymes  belong  to the glycoside 
hydrolase family and are  capable of hydrolyzing cellulose materials and related 
oligosaccharides into glucose and other monoproduct s (Lynd et al., 2002; Peciu lyte, 
2007; Sukharnikov et al., 2012). This multi -enzyme complexes, includ e three enzymes , 
namely: endo -1,4-β-D-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.4 (CMCase), exo -1,4-β-D-glucanase, EC 
3.2.1.91 (cellodextrinase), β -glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.21 (cel lobiase) (Dashtban et al., 
2009). Cellulolytic enzymes are the third largest  industrial enzymes worldwide d ue to 
their applications in  many industrial fields such as food, paper and pulp, textile and 
detergent industry, feed additives paper recycling, waste water treatment, organic acids, 
bio-ethanol, etc.  
The main problem for industrial application of this enzyme is the high - cost and l ow 
yield of the production. Therefore, the use of low -cost fermentation technologies as well 
as develop ing hyper producing microbial strains to utilize cheaper substrates can help to 
reduce the production cost as well as to achieve environmental  sustainabi lity (Kurup et 
al., 2005; Singhania, 2009). Several microorganisms can use lignocellulosic wastes as 
their growth medium to produce cellulolytic enzymes. Filamentous fungi are generally 
known to be a good source for cellulases due to their ability of decom posing 
lignocellulose  materials, extracellular release, higher yields prod uction of enzymes 
compared to other  microbes and abi lity to produce complete enzyme  complex (Lee and 
Koo, 2001). Many fungal species including Aspergillus sp, Trichoderma  sp and 
Penicillium  sp. (Bansal et al., 2012; Prasanna et al., 2016; Ellilä et al., 2017) are used to 
produce cellulolytic enzymes especially Aspergillus  ornatus  (Toor and Ilyas, 2014), 
Aspergillus niger  and Rhizopus  sp. (Baig and Saleem, 2012; Santos et al., 2016). F ungal 
production of cellulases is carried out by both submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid 
state (SSF) fermentation (Bansal et al., 2012; Lodha et al., 2020).  
F. oxysporum  is a soil -borne plant pathogen, accountable for vascular wilts in a wide 
range of economical  plants, this disease spreads widely and takes place, nearly all the 
cucumber plant regions in the world. Fusarium  wilt has already become one of  the most 
destructive diseases in commercial production of cucumber (Ye et al., 2004).  
Biological con trol using antagonistic microbes to minimize the use of chemicals  has 
become important  in recent years (Khan and Khan, 2001).  
This study is focused on bio -utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzyme 
production using submerged and solid -state fermen tation techniques as well as using the 
bioorganic materials in cont rolling Fusarium  wilt of cucumber (C. sativus L.). Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

Media  
The following media were used:  Czapek ’s dox medium (CDA), potato dextrose agar 
(PDA) and potato dextrose witho ut agar (PDB) (Nasr et al., 2011), mineral salt medium 
(MSl) described by Cunha et al. (2012) and contained (w/v): 0.14% (NH 4)2SO 4, 0.20% 
KH 2PO 4, 0.03% CaCl 2, 0.02% MgSO 47H2O, 0.50% peptone, 0.20% yeast extract, 
0.03% urea, 0.10% Tween 80, and 0.10% of sal t solution (5 mg/L FeSO 47H2O, 1.6 
mg/L, MnSO 4H2O, 1.4 mg/L ZnSO 47H2O, and 2.0 mg/L CoCl 2) and mineral salt 
medium  + 1.5% agar (MSA). All media are of high chemical purity products of DIFCO, 
Becton Dickinson and Company, USA.  
 
Selection and preparation of r aw material  
Newspaper, coated cardboard, kraft  brown bags, corrugated cardboard, foolscap and 
A4 printout paper sheets of 80 g were selected for the cellulase production and these 
wastes were  collected from the different areas of Kafr El -Sheikh Governorate : Kafr El -
Sheikh University  Colleges, houses and supermarkets. All wastepaper material and 
Whatman No. 1 filter paper  were cut into small pieces and dried in a hot -air oven to 
reduce the moisture content; substrates were then milled to obtain the powder fo rm. 
 
Sample collection  
Isolation samples of 500  g (ml) were collected in sterile  plastic containers from two 
localities which serve as their natural habitat for cellulose -degrading fungi, four  samples 
were obtained from Kafr El -Sheikh University farms: (A1 ) mature compost, (A2) 
immature compost, (A3) cow dung and (A4) old degraded tree. As well as three 
samples, (B1) primary effluent mud (B2) wastewater from the sedimentation reservoir, 
(B3) paper wastes were collected from the paper factory located in Tant a city - Gharbia 
Governorate in Egypt as shown in Figure 1. 
 
Isolation, purification and screening of cellulolytic fungi  
Isolation was performed by serial dilution method , 100  μl of each dilution was 
spread on plates containing MSA medium supplemented with  1% carboxymethyl 
cellulose (CMC) as a sole source of carbon and incubated at room temperature for 
4 days. Morphologically dissimilar single fungal colonies were isolated and f urther 
purified by repeated cultur ing on the same media to obtain a pure culture and then 
stocked at 4  °C on PDA slant in refrigerator for further studies.  
Cellulolytic isolates were screened by clearance test using Congo red staining method 
as described b y Teather and Wood (1982). Cellulolytic fungal isolates were selected on 
the basis of the diameter of the clear zone surrounding the colonies, hydrolysis zone could 
be observed only around colonies of the active fungal isolates. Cellulolytic activity on 
CMC agar was recorded as the Cellulolytic Index  (CI) which was recorded as hydrolysis 
ratios  = clear zone diameter / growth diameter (Khokhar et al., 2012).  
 
Identification  
All selected fungal isolates were identified on the basis of morphological 
characteri stics. Mycelia morphology characteristics such as surface appearance, texture, 
reverse and pigmentation were determined on the CDA and PDA plates after incubation Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

The efficient cellulolytic fungus identification encoded 13A  was completed  
according to molecular biology techniques. For molecular identification, fungal 
mycelium from a 3 days old culture in potatoes dextrose broth (PDB) was harvested 
using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The total genomic DNA was extracted using CTA B 
protocol (Benito et al., 1993). DNA of the fungal isolate was amplified by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) at Sigma Scientific Services.  The identification was achieved by 
comparing the contiguous DNA sequence with data from the reference and type strain s 
available in public databases of Gen Bank using the BLAST program (National Centre 
for Biotechnology Information). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.Gov/BLAST). The obtained 
nucleotide  sequences were aligned using ARB to construct the phylogenetic tree using 
the neighbor -joining method based on Jukes Cantor Model and the isolate was 
registered in Gen Bank (Eida et al., 2018).  
 
Effect of pH and temperature on A. niger strain 13A growth and cellulases 
production  
Production of cellulolytic enzymes was performed by Sm F method in a 250 mL 
Erlenmeyer flasks. All flask contained 100 ml of MSL medium supplemented with 1% 
carboxymethyl cellulose as a sole source of carbon. After sterilizing medium was 
inoculated with 3 ml of 1  × 106 A. niger  strain 13A spore suspension. To determine the 
optimum pH the experiment was carried out at pH levels (4, 5, 6, 7  and 8), and the 
culture was incubated at room temperature for 6 day s. Optimal  temperature  was Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

temperature values  (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50  °C) for 6 day s. 
 
Bio-utilization of different paper waste materials  
The production of cellulolytic enzymes using waste paper was carried out at the 
optimal fermentation parameters under Smf and SSF. For Sm F, fifty ml of MSL 
medium was applied  containing 1% from each prepared raw -material or CMC as a 
control. SSF was carried out in fermentation medium, containing 5 g of each prepared 
raw-material or Whatman No. 1 filter paper  as a control, moistened with 7.5  ml nutrient 
salt solution . All flasks were inoculated with 3  ml of 1 × 106 fungus spore suspension 
and incubated at 35 °C for 14 days.  
 
Enzyme extraction  
For extraction of cellulases in the SmF process, fungal cultures w ere filtered through 
a two layered woven gauze , while in SSF the enzyme was extracted by adding 50 mL  of 
0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 4.8) on SSF culture -flasks and shaken at 120 rpm for 1  h to 
separate and suspend the extracellular enzymes in the buffer. The whole contents were 
then filtered as in the case of SmF. The culture filtrate thus obtained was cent rifuged for 
20 min at 7000 rpm to separate  the biomass, and the supernatant was analyzed to 
determine the cellulolytic productivity (Imran et al., 2017).  
 
Analytical methods  
FP-ase and CMC -ase activities were determined using IUPAC methods as described 
by Ghose (1987 ). Reducing sugar concentration was estimated by dinitrosalicylic acid 
(DNS) method using glucose as the standard (Miller, 1959).  
 
Estimation of fungal growth  
The mycelial dry weight of biomass (g) was determ ined by washing the fungal 
filtrate mycelium and biomass pellet obtained from centrifugation process and drying it 
at 80  °C for 24  h (Belal, 2003).  
 
Assay of biocontrol agents  
A. niger strain 13A was evaluated for their ability to inhibit Fusarium  oxysporum in 
dual culture as described by Mar tyn and Stack (1990)  and Tapwal et al. (2005). The 
radial mycelial growth of the pathogen was recorded after 10 days of incubation and 
inhibition percent in mycelial growth was calculated as:  inhibition Percent  = Control – 
Treatment  / Control × 100. 
 
Biode gradation of paper wastes mixture to produce biomass (bioorganic materials) 
for the suppression of Fusarium wilt of cucumber  
Dry-milled paper wastes, kraft brown bags, cardboard, foolscap and printout paper 
were mixed well with ratio of 1:1:1:1 and placed in two glass boxes. This mixture was 
moistened in a ratio of 1  g: 3 ml of MSL medium without  the addition of any carbon 
source, as well as moistened when needed under steril e conditions. One of the two boxes 
was treated with 1  × 106 spore suspension of A. niger strain 13A while the other was not 
treated. The two boxes were incubated at the optimal growth conditions for 42 days, on Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

carried out using statistical program, SPSS, version, 20.  
Results and discussion  
Isolation and screening of fungi with cellulolytic production  
Seven samples were collected from differ ent locates for  the isolation of highly 
efficient cellulose degrading fungi. Twenty -three fungal strains were isolated, out of 
which 11 fungal isolates were selected based on morphological dissimilar ities and tested 
to assess the celluloes -hydrolisis abili ty on MSA medium containing 1% CMC as sole 
carbon source as tabulated in Table 1. All tested isolates showed Cellulolytic Index (CI) 
ranging from 0.0 to 0.47 mm. High CI values of 0.47 mm was showed by the isolate 
encoded 13A which was isolated from immatu re compost. this isolate was selected as a 
potential cellulase producing isolate for further studies .

All selected isolates were preliminary classified based on the morphological  and the 
microscopical characteristics . Eleven isolates were identified as Trichoderma  sp, 
Penicillium  sp., Rhizopus  sp., Mucor  sp., Aspergillus niger , Fusarium  sp. Aspergillus 
sp. Cladosporium  sp, Aspergillus flavus , Penicillium  sp. and  Alternaria  sp. Fungi are 
known to excrete a large number of cellulolytic enzymes for commercial production 
(Imran et al., 2016).  
The most efficient isolate 13 A was confirmed and identified based on molecular 
approach following 18Sr DNA sequencing. This isolate was found to be closely similar 
to Aspergillus niger , thus identified as A. niger . This sequence has been recorded i n 
NCBI GenBank with an accession No. SFC101821  with the name of A. niger  strain 
13A. Phylogenetic tree showed in Figure 2  was constructed by neighbor -joining method 
using nucleotide evolutional model based on synonymous and non -synonymous 
nucleotide substi tutions. Aspergillus niger  is known to be a good producer  of 
cellulolytic enzymes perhaps due to its high cellulase  productivity and safe use in 
industry. Our results are in agreement with previous findings of researche rs, such as  
Juhasz et al. (2003)  and Abdullah  et al. (2016). Therefore, Aspergillus niger  strain 13A 
was selected as efficient producer for extracellular cellulases for further studies.

Effect of pH and temperature on A. niger strain 13A growth and cellulases 
production  
Environmental factors have an important influence on the microbial growth, 
production activi ty and their degradation ability of organic material. Factors like pH and 
temperature, have an important effect on the microbial degradation of paper wastes and 
so these conditions must be considered when the biodegradability of paper wastes is 
tested (Bel al, 2008) therefor e temperature and pH factors were optimized to determine 
the optimal conditions for growth and maximum levels of cellulase  production.  Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

The effect of pH on A. niger  strain  13A growth and their cellulase  production is 
shown in Table 2.  Generally, the obtained results showed that the optimum pH for A. 
niger  strain 13A was pH 6.0. The maximum mycelial dry weight was 
0.37 ± 0.026  g/100  ml as well as the maximum production of CMC -ase and FP -ase were 
1.24 ± 0.049  and 0.27  ± 0.025 IU/ml  respectively. Fung us growth and FP -ase 
production showed stability at pH 6.0 -7.0, a further increase in the optimal pH 
decreased the growth and cellulase productivity. The enzyme production reduced 
drastically at pH 9.0, this decreasing at higher pH may b e due to proteolytic inhibition 
of the cellulase. slightly ac idic pH is preferred for cellulase  production by A. niger  (Dutt 
and Kumar, 2014).

Optimum temperature  
The influence of different temperatures on  A. niger  strain 13A growth and t heir 
cellulase  production is shown in Table 3.  The highest yield of mycelial dry weight 
(0.51  ± 0.025 g/100 ml) as well as the maximum productivity of CMC -ase 
(1.21  ± 0.041  IU/ml) FP -ase (0.44  ± 0.060 IU/ml) was obtained when A. niger  strain 
13A was grown at 35  °C and  the initial pH was 6.0. An increase in incubation 
temperature to 35  °C decrease fungus growth and enzyme production. Our results  are in 
agreement with previous findings of researche rs, such as  Sohail et al. (2009)  and Nasr et 
al. (2011)  who reported that the optimum temperature for cellulase production by the 
fungus might lie between 27 and 35  °C. The decrease of cellulase  production levels at 
lower temperature may be due to the depress ed transport of cellulose a cross the ce lls, 
causing reduc ed yield of cellulase  production (Dutt and Kumar, 2014).  
 
Bio-utilization of different paper waste materials  
Aspergillus niger  strain 13A was used under the optimal growth conditions with the 
aim of utilization of paper waste materials as  a sole carbon source for cellulase  
production under submerged (SmF) and solid -state fermentation (SSF).  
The obtained results were illustrated in Figure 3;  the general trend of substrate 
degradation with A. niger  strain 13A under both of SmF and SSF was CM C (SmF 
control)  > filter paper (SSF control)  > kraft brown 
bags > cardboard  > foolscap  > printout paper  > newspapers and coated cardboard. The 
highest production of cellulase  by A. niger  strain 13A was obtained by using kraft  Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

Kraft brown bags and cardboard contain  about 60 -70% cellulose, 10 -20% 
hemicellulose, and  they have  a high content of lignin about 5 -10% on the other hand 
office paper contains about 70% cellulose and 4% lignin. Newspaper production is 
made from paper with high recycled fibre or paper , which  contain s about 40 -55% 
cellulose, 25 -40% hemicellulos e, and 18 -30% lignin ( López Alvarez et al., 2009; Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

content of printing pap er and foolscap compared with other type of paper s, brown bags 
and cardboard were found favorable source s of carbon for cellulolytic A. niger  strain 
13A. These results may be depending on a high lignin content of newspaper and coated 
cardboard in addition to quantity and type of pigment and ink and other contaminants 
included with using  paper mat erials. Cummings and Stewart (1994) reported that the 
presence of ink reduced the rate of cellulose solubilization as well as inhibi ted the 
biodegradation process.  
The obtained results also showed the highest production of cellulase  by A. niger  
strain 13A was exhibited under SSF compared with SmF for all kinds of paper waste. 
On the other hand, the CMC -ase production was higher than the FP -ase production for 
all wastes under both SSF and SmF . SSF has many advantages over SmF such as low -
cost, and higher yie ld of enzymes and productivity, absence of free water and control of 
bacterial contamination, therefore it is a more suitable  technique for the production of 
fungal enzymes (Bansal et al., 2012; Lodha et al., 2020).  
 
Assay of biocontrol agents  
The experime nt between Aspergillus niger  strain 13A and Fusarium oxysporum  
showed noticeable inhibitory effect on the pathogen. The inhibition rate of Aspergillus 
niger  strain 13A  ranged from  63.27 to 78.5%.  
 
Biodegradation of paper wastes mixture to produce biomass ( bioorganic materials) 
for the suppression Fusarium wilt in cucumber  
The four best carbon sources of waste paper materials have been mixed well and 
used as a mass multiplication substrate for A. niger  strain  13A to evaluate it is efficacy 
against the cucumb er (Cucumis sativus L.)  wilt pathogen. A mixture of wast e materials 
exhibited complete  degradation after 42 day s and the color of wastepaper mixture was 
convert ed to black  which is the color of  Aspergillus niger ; this process produce s 
biomass called bioorg anic materials . Under g reenhouse conditions, application of the 
bioorganic materials to soil infested artificially with  F. oxysporum,  Table 4  and Figure 
4, exhibited their efficacy to control Fusarium  wilt and increased survival of plants.  
The results also  showed that the use of  A. niger -bioorganic materials  had 
demonstrated high efficiency in reducing the disease incidence and disease severity of 
Fusarium wilt infection. While the incidence and disease severity of A. niger -bioorganic  
materials  were 44 % and  26% respectively, with  the efficiency 37.97 and 55.85 , in the 
control treatment ( F. Oxysporum  and F. oxysporum  + untreated mixture ) incidence and 
disease severity  were 71.33, 60% and 72, 61% , respectively.  Sen et al. (1993) and 
Vibha (2011) reported that A. niger  is a potential  biocontrol agent for soil borne 
pathogens . The antagonistic interaction of A. niger  with the disease may be due to 
production of antibio tics, overgrowth and hyper -parasitism.  Abed et al. (2019) referred  
to the use of T. harzianum , T. viride , and Glomus mo sseae  having  a significant effect in 
reducing the disease incidence of Fusarium wilt of cucumber with the efficiency of 
43.54, 39.11  and 65.18% , respectively . Also,  Ahmed  (2010) found that Pseudomonas 
fluorescens No.3 and Serratia ma rcensens  No.2 had compl etely prevented the Fusarium 
wilt disease incidence. Compared to the previous reports , A. niger  strain13A is 
considered a promising  biological control agent.  Belal et al. : Utilization of paper wastes for cellulolytic enzymes production by Aspergillus niger  strain 13A

Conclusion  
Successful experiments have been made to convert paper waste (P W) materials i nto 
high-value -added products. K raft brown bags, cardboard, foolscap, printout paper, 
newspapers and coated cardboard which are some of the paper waste s used in this study 
as a fermentation substrate produced a good amount of cellulolytic enz yme by 
Asperigillus niger  strain  13A u nder solid state fermentation. In addition , using A. niger -
bioorganic material exhibited efficiency in controlling  Fusarium wilt in cucumber. The 
application of these results may help in limit ing the effect of environm ental pollution 
caused by paper waste  materials and fungicides.  
This study recommends the utilization of paper wastes as a renewable resource of 
cellulosic constituents to consolidate a cleaner environment and to produce valuable 
materials. O n the other ha nd, the use of A. niger  as a biological control agent needs 
further  study  and evaluation.
