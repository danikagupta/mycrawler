Introduction
Azo dyes are produced in very large quantities and used
as reactive dyes by the cotton industry. They are very
stable and resistant to chemical processes. Therefore,
their removal from industrial effluents by conventionalmethods (mechanical screening, sedimentation,
biological treatment, biofilters) alone is usually not very
effective. This problem can be solved by combining theconventional techniques with other methods. Radiation
chemistry is one of the most promising advanced
oxidation processes (AOP’s) [3, 8, 9] for environmentalremediation. In AOP’s hydroxyl radicals are the main
oxidants for the degradation of organic pollutants [13].
The disappearance of the dye is generally followed by
spectrophotometry at the absorbance maximum between
450 and 600 nm.
The dye disappearance curves are very often
described by applying some kinetic equations [4, 6, 7,
10, 15, 17 −19] in order to describe the dependence of
the destruction on such parameters as dose, dose rate,
additives, etc. in radiolysis experiments, illumination
intensity, illumination time, etc. in photo oxidationexperiments [15].
For the present mechanistic and kinetic studies, the
experimental results obtained during radiolysis of
Apollofix Red (AR-28) and Reactive Black 5 (RB-5)are discussed. Some of the experimental results were
already published [16, 20, 21].Azo dye degradation by high-energy

Reactive Black 5 (RB-5) radiolysis in dilute aqueous solution. The dose dependence of colour disappearance is linear
when the reactive intermediate reacts with the colour bearing part of the molecule causing destruction of the conjugation
here with nearly 100% efficiency. In this case, spectrophotometry can be used to follow-up dye decomposition. Sucha linear dependence was observed when hydrated electrons or hydrogen atoms reacted with the dye. However, in
the case of hydroxyl radical reactions some coloured products form with absorption spectra very similar to those of the
starting dye molecules. For that reason, spectrophotometric measurements give false results about the concentration ofintact dye molecules. Analysis made by the HPLC (high-pressure liquid chromatography) method reveals logarithmic
time dependence in agreement with a theoretical model developed.

The colours of these dyes are determined by the
conjugated phenylsulphonic acid-azo group-H-acid
parts of the molecules [1] (see Scheme 1). Any change
in these parts leads to change of colour, i.e. change of
the absorption spectrum in the visible range. Destruction
of the extensive conjugation leads to loss of colour, i.e.disappearance of absorption in the visible range.
Experimental
AR-28 was obtained from Taiheung Corporation(Kyunggido, South Korea), RB-5 was purchased fromAldrich, the dyes were purified by recrystallization from
methanol/ethanol mixtures. Perchloric acid was used
to set pH of the solutions when the 
•H atom reactions
were studied. Methanol (HPLC grade) and tetrabutyl-
ammonium-hydrogen sulphate (TBAHS) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, tert-butanol from Spektrum-3D.
The gamma radiolytic experiments were carried out
using a 60Co irradiation facility with a dose rate of
3.0 kGy⋅h−1 as determined by Fricke dosimetry ( G(Fe2+)
= 15.6 (100 eV)−1). The solutions were bubbled with
N2 or N2O for 5 min prior to irradiation in 5 ml Pyrex
glass ampoules. 1 cm Suprasil quartz optical cells wereused for taking the UV-VIS absorption spectra before
and after the reaction by using a Jasco 550 UV-VIS
spectrophotometer.The chromatographic system consisted of a Jasco
PU-2089Plus quaternary gradient pump, a Jasco MD-
2015Plus diode-array Multiwavelenght Detector and
a Nucleosil 100 C18 column (Teknokroma®) (pore size5 µm, length 15 cm, diameter 0.4 cm). Separations were
made using 50 mmol ⋅dm
−3 aqueous solution of TBAHS
at pH 6.1 and methanol. All mobile phases were filteredusing a Millipore 0.45 µm filter and were degassed by
ultrasonication before use. The separations were made
at room temperature using injection volume of 10 µl,
and flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min.
Standard radiation chemical techniques were
applied to separate the water radiolysis intermediatesand follow their reactions with the dye. The radiolysis
of water supplies hydrated electron (e
−
aq), hydroxyl
radical (•OH) and hydrogen atom (•H) reactive inter-
mediates with G values (species (100 eV)−1) shown in
Eq. (1). In order to reduce the number of reactive
intermediates, the reactions of •OH radicals were
studied in N2O saturated solutions (pH 5 −6), in such
solutions the hydrated electrons are converted to •OH
radicals (Eq. (2)). When the e−
aq reactions were
investigated the solutions were bubbled with N2 for
deoxygenation and contained 0.5 mol ⋅dm−3 tert-butanol
in order to transform the •OH radicals to less reactive
•CH2(CH3)2COH radicals (Eq. (3)) (pH 5 −6). H• atoms
react with a low rate coefficient with tert-butanol
(Eq. (4)). The H• reactions were studied in t-butanol

Results and discussion
Degradation of AR-28 and RB-5
Figure 1 shows the comparison of the decolouration of
AR-28 and RB-5 in the reaction with •OH (1A, 1B)

and e−
aq (1C, 1D), respectively. When •OH radicals
reacted with the dye, during the decolouration the shape
of the spectra in the visible range changed: the visiblebands shifted to longer wavelengths. After separation
of the main product formed from AR-28 by HPLC, wefound that its spectrum is very similar to the spectrum ofthe starting dye. The only difference is the shift of the
visible band to longer wavelength (Fig. 2) and this causes
the change in the shape of the UV-VIS spectra (Fig. 1A).The initial G values (extrapolated to zero dose) of dye
disappearance were 2.92 for RB 5 and 2.5 for AR-28.
When e−
aq reacted with the dyes (Figs. 1C and 1D),
the intensity of the visible absorption decreased with the
radiation dose without any major change in the shape
of the spectrum in the visible range for AR-28. In thecase of RB-5 there is no change in the spectrum above
ca. 550 nm. The initial G values (extrapolated to zero
dose) of dye disappearance were 1.91 for RB 5 and 2.6for AR-28.
Mechanism of degradation
As it was discussed in our former papers [20, 21] •OH
radical has very high reactivity with the aromatic ringand with the azo group subparts of the molecule [12,
14]. The addition of •OH radical to an aromatic ring on
the conjugated part of the molecule results in a cyclo-hexadienyl type radical. This radical may disappear in
radical-radical combination reaction where dimer
molecule is produced (in this reaction the conjugationmay be destroyed). Radical disproportionation leads
to compounds that contain cyclohexadiene ring and
another compound with extensive conjugation inthe molecule characteristic of the dye. However, the
latter molecule contains an extra OH group in
the conjugated part of the molecule (see Scheme 2).For that reason, its absorption spectrum is slightly
different from that of the starting molecule. This shift
in the spectrum certainly affects the molar extinctioncoefficient, and, therefore, any kinetic analysis based
on the absorbance measurements should be handled
with a certain caution. The correct analysis should bebased on chemical separation and individual compound
analysis (most conveniently by the HPLC method).
The hydrated electron (and also the H
• atom) is
suggested to react with the azo group (with rate coeffi-
cients close to the diffusion controlled limit [5, 11])
destroying the conjugation with nearly 100% efficiency
[20, 21]. The other parts of the molecule and the products
formed during decay have smaller reactivity with e−
aq
and H• atom than the azo group.
Kinetic analysis
Under steady state conditions, the •OH, H•, e−
aq
intermediates that destroy the dye molecules may react
practically exclusively with the intact dye molecules
decolourizing them. The time dependence of dye
disappearance can be described by the differentialequation:
(6)In the equation [Dye] represents the dye concentration,
[I] is the intermediate radical concentration, and k is
the second order rate coefficient.
During steady-state radiolysis, the intermediate
radicals form with a constant rate ( r
I) and they decay
with the same rate ( k[I] [Dye]):d[Dye][I][Dye]dkt−=

(7)
At the beginning of the process, when the dye concen-
tration is high, the intermediate radicals quickly react
with the solute molecules, and therefore, the
intermediate radical concentration is low. At the endof the process, [Dye] is low and k[I] is high. Substituting
[I] ≈ r
I/k [Dye] into Eq. (6), after integration, we obtain
linear time dependence (since the irradiation is usuallycarried with a constant dose rate, there is linear dose
dependence):
(8)
Such a linear dependence was observed several times
during decolouration at the beginning part of the
process. We found linear initial dose dependence, whenin radiolysis the hydrated  electrons or the hydrogen
atoms reacted with the dyes (Figs. 3 and 4). As we
mentioned before, these intermediates were found toreact principally with the azo group causing destruction
of the intensive conjugation in the molecule through
the azo bond. In AR-28 there is only one azo groupwith high reactivity, and here the linearity is maintained
till about 80% destruction. In the RB-5 there are two
azo groups. When e
−
aq or •H destroys one of them, due
to the decreased conjugation, the longest wavelength
absorption disappears. However, the other azo group
may also react with high rate coefficient with e−
aq or
•H and, therefore, the linear range is shorter. The
formation rates of reactive intermediates at a dose rate
of 3 kGy ⋅h−1, calculated from the slopes of the straight
lines are rI,measured  ≈ (2.0−2.5) × 10−7 mol⋅s−1 for both e−
aq
and H•. The value is just slightly lower than the value
calculated based on the radiation chemical yield of theintermediates: r
I,calculated  ≈ 2.8 × 10−7 mol⋅s−1.
At higher doses, however, the dye is depleted;
therefore, the e−
aq and H• intermediates of water
radiolysis react mainly with the products of radiolysis
and only a small part of the intermediates reacts with the
azo moiety causing decolouration. For that reason,the time dependence curve at higher depletion deviates
from linearity.
The reaction of •OH radical with the dye is different
from the reactions of e−
aq and H•. The •OH radical reacts
with practically diffusion limited rate coefficient ( k ≈
1010 mol−1⋅dm3⋅s−1) with the aromatic rings and probably
also with the –N=N– double bond. The dye molecules
generally have several places for the attack, e.g. AR-28has five aromatic rings and one –N=N– double bond.
The reaction with the –N=N– double bond or with the
rings involved in the extensive conjugation leads
to the destruction of the conjugation, so may decolourize
the molecule. However, the new products have alsohigh, practically the same reactivity towards the 
•OH
radicals as the starting compound. That is probably true
for the product of the product, i.e. for the secondary
product, tertiary product, etc. For that reason, the rateequations should be written in the following form:
  (9)
(10)
Since − as it was mentioned before − the reaction of
•OH with both the dye and the products is practically
diffusion limited; we use for both reactions the same k
rate coefficient. Applying the simplification:
(11) [Product]  ≈ [Dye]0 – [Dye]
also taking [•OH] ≈ rOH/k[Dye]0 expressed from formulae
(6) and (7) (I = •OH), the differential equation has the
form:
(12)
After integration, we obtain logarithmic time depend-
ence (Eq. (13)) with rate parameter of kobs = rOH/[Dye]0.

By expanding the logarithmic term in series and keeping
only the first part Eq. (13) is transformed into Eq. (8)
which means that at low conversion the dose depend-
ence is again linear.
Figure 5 shows the ln[Dye]/[Dye]0 vs. dose plot
obtained when the dyes were degraded by •OH radicals
(N2O saturated solution). Good linear logarithmic plot
was obtained when the dye concentrations in the
irradiated solutions were determined by the HPLC
method. The figure also shows the dose dependencesobtained by spectrophotometric evaluation at the
absorbance maximum in AR-28 and RB-5 solutions.
The strong positive deviations from the linearity, as itwas mentioned before, may be attributed to reformation
of the somewhat modified dye molecules.
In Eq. (13) k
obs = rOH/[Dye]0, i.e. it is the ratio of the
intermediate formation rate and the initial dye concen-
tration. The slope of the curve obtained by HPLC in
Fig. 5 is  kobs = 6.4 kGy−1, or using the dose rate applied
(3 kGy⋅h−1), 5.4 × 10−2 s−1. Then, the formation rate of
•OH radicals based on the dye disappearance is
rOH,measured  = 4.6 × 10−7 mol⋅s−1, the value agrees well with
the one calculated from the dose rate and the
known radiation chemical yield •OH radicals, rOH,calculated
≈ 4.7 × 10−7 mol⋅s−1. The high value of rOH,measured  indicates
that the •OH radicals react with practically 100%
efficiency with the dye molecules transforming them to
new, coloured, or non-coloured products.
Conclusions
AR-28 and RB-5 can be effectively decomposed by •OH
and e−
aq intermediates of water radiolysis. •OH radicals
add to the aromatic rings and as products of this
reaction hydroxylated dyes and probably quinine type
molecules and dimers are formed. These products havealso high reactivity towards 
•OH radicals. e−
aq and •H
atom attacks the azo group, instantly destroying
the electron conjugation in the dye molecules and theproducts formed are less reactive towards e−
aq and •H
atom. The dose dependence of colour disappearance
is linear when e−
aq or •H atom reacts with the dye
molecules. In case of •OH reactions there is logarithmic
dose dependence of dye disappearance. In the paper
a kinetic model was proposed which described theexperimental results.
