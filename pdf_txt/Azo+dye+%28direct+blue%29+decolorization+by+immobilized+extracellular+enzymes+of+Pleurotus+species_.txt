Abstract
In the present 
investigation the efficiency of three species of white rot fungui - Pleurotus  and their improved 
dikaryons (heterokaryons) was assessed for decolorization of Phenol Red (Phenolsulfonphthalein or PSP) and 
production of lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase enzymes. All the species of 
Pleurotus  i.e. P. flabellatus, P. ostreatus  and P. citrinopileatus  decolorized PSP well. However, improved dikaryons 
Pfo 6X9 and Poc 9X6 decolorized the dye more effectively than three species of Pleurotus . The improved dikaryons 
also showed higher ligninolytic activity than the parental species. Poc 9X6  showed higher  LiP (56.14 U), MnP (615.15 
U) and Laccase (715.25 U) activity.  In the present work different pH, age and concentration of inoculum and effect of
surfactant i.e. sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and Tween-80 were analyzed in order to determine the optimum onesto decolorize maximum concentration of dye. 5 ml of 10 days old culture on pH 5.5 and 0.1% Tween-80 supportedmaximum decolorization of PSP.

Introduction
A vast amount of dyes are produced annually with a variety of 
color and chemical structure around the world. These synthetic organic 
compounds with multiple aromatic rings either fused or connected covalently and modified with various hydrophilic functional group such as amine, carboxylic acid, carbonyl and hydroxyl group to produce desired color and increase affinity to the material being dyed. These dyes are generally employed as coloring agent in food, pharmaceutical, woolen, paper, metal, cosmetic and textile industries [1]. The textile industries are major consumer of these dyes and account for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market. The increasing use of synthetic dyes is alarming and their discharge as textile waste may cause substantial ecological damage. Many synthetic dyes are nontoxic, some of their degradation byproducts such as anilines are often more toxic and sometimes carcinogenic than the parent compounds. In addition to the toxicity, residual organic dye can also exert various hazards on the aquatic ecosystem by depleting dissolved oxygen, blocking sunlight penetration, inhibiting photosynthesis and growth of aquatic organism [2,3].
Removal of color from dye containing wastewater is a current 
issue of discussion and regulation in many countries, because water is a viable asset that should be protected [4]. The conventional physical and chemical methods possess inherent limitations such as high cost, formation of hazardous byproducts and intensive energy requirement [5,6]. In spite of the existing physical/chemical technologies, biological process provide an alternative, because they are cost effective, eco-friendly and can be applied to wide range of dye containing effluents [7-9]. Currently, a lot of studies have focused on white rot fungi (WRF) than seem to be more prospective organism [10,11]. Due to extracellular nonspecific enzyme system WRF are so far exclusive in their strong oxidative capability. Pleurotus  is a WRF which produces 
two major families of enzymes generally termed ligninolytic enzymes 
i.e. extracellular peroxidase (Manganese Peroxidase, MnP; ManganeseIndependent Peroxidase MIP; Lignin Peroxidase, LiP and Versatile Peroxidase, VP) and Phenol oxidase (Laccase).
However, not much attention has been raised for its decolorization 
ability. The current work is to source out the capability, efficacy and efficiency of the Pleurotus  species and its improved dikaryons 
(heterokaryons) in production of LiP , MnP and Laccase enzymes and in decolorizing the synthetic textile dye such as PSP on different pH, age and concentration of inoculum, surfactants viz. sodium dodecyl sulphate and Tween-80. This research is also indirectly contributing knowledge to wastewater treatment in textile industries.
Materials and Methods
Cultures and their maintenance
The pure cultures of P . flabellatus, P . ostreatus and P . citrinopileatus  
used in present experiments were procured from Directorate of Mushroom Research, Solan and Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. Throughout the study, the stock cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at 25
ºC and sub-cultured at 
regular interval of three weeks.
Production of enzymes
The experiment on production of ligninolytic enzymes was 
carried out in potato dextrose broth medium (20% peeled potato and 2% dextrose). Double distilled water was used for preparation of the medium and pH was adjusted at 6.0 by using N/10 NaOH or N/10 HCl. Incubation was carried out at 25°C in BOD incubator in cotton Page 2 of 6Citation: Singh MP, Srivastava AK (2016) Decolorization of Synthetic Textile Dye and Enzymes Production by Improved Strains of Pleurotus Species.

lugged 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of media. Each 
flask inoculated with 1 mm in diameter of agar pieces of Pleurotus  
species and improved dikaryons from actively growing area on potato dextrose agar plate. 
Extraction of extracellular enzymes
Sa
mples of substrate were collected at regular interval of 5 days and 
extracted in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for ligninolytic enzymes. Filtrate of extraction was used for enzyme assay.
Enzymatic study
L
ignin peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.14): Lignin peroxidase activity 
was determined using veratryl alcohol as substrate. The reaction 
mixture contained 1 ml of crude enzyme extract, 0.5 ml of 2 mM veratryl alcohol, 1.5 ml of 0.1 mM Sodium tartrate buffer (pH 2.5) and 0.2 ml of 0.4 mM H
2O2. 
The oxidation of substrate was followed 
by spectrophotometrically at λma
x310 nm (41). On
e activity unit was 
defined as 1 µmol of veratryl alcohol oxidized per minute. 
Manganese peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.13): Manganese peroxidase 
(MnP) activity was determined using guaiacol as substrate. The reaction mixture contained 0.2 ml of 0.5 M Na-tartrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 ml of 1 mM MnSO
4, 0.1 m
l of 1 mM H2O2, 0.25 m
l of 1 mM guaiacol and 
0.3 ml of crude enzymes. The oxidation of substrate at was followed spectrophotometrically at λ
ma
x 465 nm [12].
L
accase (EC 1.10.3.2): Laccase activity was determined via the 
oxidation of o-methoxyphenol catechol monomethylether (guaiacol) as substrate. The reaction mixture contains 1 ml of 1 mM guaiacol in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 1 ml  crude  enzyme solution was incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The oxidation fis followed by the increase in absorbance at λ
ma
x 495 nm [13]. 
Fructification and basidiospore isolation
C
ultivation:  The method of spawn, substrate preparation and 
spawning were described in our earlier published paper [14,15] and 
illustrated in Figures 1A-1C. Spore print: The dropping spores were selected from healthy and 
young fruit bodies to prepare spore prints. The cap of the mushroom fruit body was cut down and kept on sterilized paper, on the sterilized petriplate, with gills down (Figure 1D). The petriplate was then sealed properly with cello tape and the entire setup was placed in an undisturbed area for overnight. When the cap was removed, the spore prints were collected in the petriplate on paper. Then the resulted spore prints of Pleurotus species were stored at 4°C for their use in single 
spore isolation.
Germination and isolation of homokaryons: Paper bearing 
spores was cut into 2 × 2 cm size and suspended in 0.5% NaCl in 100 ml sterilized double distilled water and agitated at 150 rpm in orbitary shaker for 2 hour to make uniform suspension (Figure 1E). The spore suspension further serially diluted up to 10
-4 di
lution from which 150 
ml of the spore suspension was transferred and spread to each petriplate containing 18-20 ml of solid agar medium under aseptic condition. The inoculated petriplate were incubated at 25°C in BOD incubator for one week. After germination of single spore (Figure 1F) marked with the help of permanent marker on backside of petriplate, it was lifted with the help of a fine tip of inoculation needle and transferred to another petriplate containing 18-20 ml potato dextrose agar medium under aseptic condition. The single spore colonies were confirmed by lacking of clamp connection through microscopy. Then these colonies were sub-cultured on PDA slants and incubated at 25°C in BOD incubator for further use.
Mating test: The mating compatibility between heterokaryotic 
cultures were performed in duel culture technique by placing actively growing mycelia (1 mm in diameter) of single spore cultures of above two strains approximately 1cm apart in the center of a 90 mm petriplate of potato dextrose agar (Figure 1G). Three replicates were used for each combination and arranged in a completely randomized design. In each step crosses were confirmed through clamp connection under 100 X magnification with cotton blue stain (Figure 1H). After the confirmation, a sample of mycelia was transferred to fresh agar medium for further examination of dye decolorization and enzymatic activities.

were incubated with dye containing liquid broth medium to evaluate maximum dye decolorization at different pH value ranging from 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0. The pH was determined with electronic pH meter model- 361. Before sterilization of media, their pH was adjusted to the required level using N/10 NaOH or N/10 HCl.
Effect of age and concentration of inoculums: Mycelial bits of 
1 mm in diameter were inoculated in 100 ml of potato dextrose broth medium in 250 ml Erlenmayer flasks and incubated in BOD incubator at 25°C for 10 and 15 days. After the maximum growth of mycelia, homogenize suspension was made at 150 rpm in orbitary shaker with the help of sterilized small glass pieces. The mycelial suspension was then inoculated in 100 ml Erlenmayer flask, containing 30 ml dye containing broth medium at the concentration of 3 ml and 5 ml and incubated in BOD incubator for observing the dye decolorization [17].
Effect of surfactants: Two types of surfactants - anionic surfactant 
i.e. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and nonionic surfactant i.e.Tween-80 were used with the dye. The concentration varied from0.5 mM, and 1.0 mM of SDS, 0.1% and 0.2% of Tween-80 in 100 mlErlenmayer flasks containing 30 ml dye in broth medium.

Discussion
Th
e lignin modifying enzymes (LMEs), i.e. lignin peroxidases 
(LiP , E.C. 1.11.1.14); manganese peroxidases (MnP , E.C. 1.11.1.13) and laccases (Lac, E.C.1.10.3.2), are produce by some WRF while, others produces only one or two of them [18,19]. There are two major families of ligninolytic enzymes which are involved in lignolysis: peroxidases and laccases [20-22]. These enzymes are capable of forming radicals inside the lignin polymer, which results in destabilization of bonds and finally in the breakdown of the macromolecule of lignin [23]. Pleurotus  
species have been reported the produce all the three modifying enzymes, which play a vital role in biodegradation and bioremediation [14,15,24]. Lignolytic enzymes are produced in the initial stage while, cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes are produced in the later stage of growth of Pleurotus  species [24,25].
The improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) exhibited maximum LiP 
activity than all the Pleurotus  species. Eichlerova et al. also reported 
similar observations that the isolates showed higher production of lignolytic enzyme in comparison to parental strain in synthetic dyes containing medium [26]. LiP catalyzes several oxidations in the side chains of lignin and related compounds by one-electron abstraction to form reactive radicals [27,28]. Also the cleavage of aromatic ring structures has been reported [29]. LiP are not essential for the attack on lignin: several highly active WRF and litter-decaying fungi (e.g. Ceriopsis subvermispora, Dichotomitus squalens, Panus tigrinus, 
Rigidosporus lignosus ) do not excrete this enzyme [18,30-33]. The 
higher MnP activity was observed by improved dikaryons whereas, the parental (Pleurotus ) species showed less MnP activity in PSP 
containing media. The basidiospore derived monokaryotic isolates is an efficient method of reaching higher variation in the production of MnP [34,35]. The principle role of Mn
2+ 
to Mn3+, 
which then binds to 
an appropriate ligands, diffuses from the enzyme and in turn oxidizes phenolic substrate [36-38], lignin as well as recalcitrant xenobiotics such as nitroaminotoluenes [23,39] and synthetic textile dyes (17). The improved dikaryons (heterokaryons) showed higher laccase activity in PSP containing medium than the parental species. Laccase and other lignolytic enzyme showed higher production on dikaryons of Pleurotus  
species obtained after crossing of compatible basidiospore-derived monokaryons selected from the parental basidiospore population on the basis of exceptionality in enzyme production [34,40].
Decolorization of synazol red (azo red) by P . ostreatus is 96% in 24 
days at pH 5.5 whereas, the enzyme exhibited highest activity at pH 6.0 (15). Srivastava et al., reported pH 5.5 as best for decolorization of Direct red by improved strains of Pleurotus  species [41]. Dominguez 
et al. (6) re-ported that, pH 4.5 supported higher peroxidase activity by P . chrysosporium  on media containing Poly R-478.8 ml 4 days old 
mycelia suspension of white rot fungi was effective for decolorization of Acid yellow 99, Acid blue 300, and Acid red 114 [17]. Maximum decolorization of Direct red was achieved by 5 ml of 10 days old culture of Pleurotus and its improved strains [41]. According to Mittar et al., 
the maximum decolorization of paper and pulp mill effluents could be seen by using 20% of 7 days old culture of P . chrysosporium  [42]. 
Urek, et al., reported, 0.05% Tween-80 supported highest MnP activity [37]. Tween-80 contains an oleat (an unsaturated fatty acid) which can peroxidized by MnP and the oxidant so generate could participate in organo-pollutant degradation by fungal culture [43]. According to Srivastava et al., 0.1% Tween-80 supported maximum decolorization of Direct red [19].
Conclusion
Th
e three species of white rot fungi i.e. Pleurotus flabellatus, P . 
ostreatus  and  P . citrinopileatus  can be used effectively and efficiently 
for dye decolorization and bioremediation of recalcitrant substances. 
However,  the improved dikaryons Pfo 6X9 and Poc 9X6 of Pleurotus 
species prepared by crossing of basidiospores-derived monokaryons can decolorized the dye more effectively than three species of Pleurotus . Besides, improved strains also exhibited higher production 
of extracellular lignolytic enzymes which have many industrial 
applications.
