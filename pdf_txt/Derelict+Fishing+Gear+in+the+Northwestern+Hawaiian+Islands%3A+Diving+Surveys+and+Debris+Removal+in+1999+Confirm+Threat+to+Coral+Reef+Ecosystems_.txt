Derelict fishing gear ABSTRACT  
Derelict fishing nets pose hazards to marine systems as they travel through the ocean or become ensnared on 
coral reefs. Understanding of the movement of nets within shallow atolls can help to optimize operations to 
protect these shallow reefs. In 2018, six derelict fishing nets at Manawai (Pearl and Hermes Reef) in the 
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were tagged with satellite-transmitting buoys and tracked for three years. This 
study reveals that nets that enter the atoll from the northeast travel southwest towards the center of the atoll, and 
nets in the center can remain ensnared on the same reef for at least three years. This study shows that satellite 
buoys are a successful approach to tracking derelict net movement, and can inform future debris removal 
missions.   
1.Introduction 
Fishing gear that has been lost, abandoned, or discarded in the open 
ocean poses a threat to marine communities. Large derelict fishing nets 
may entangle wildlife (Boland and Donohue, 2003 ; Henderson, 2001 ; 
Votier et al., 2011 ), destroy reefs (Macfadyen et al., 2009 ; Suka et al., 
2020 ), and pose navigational hazards to vessels (Hong et al., 2017 ). Nets 
are increasingly made out of plastic which takes much longer to degrade 
(Macfadyen et al., 2009 ), increasing the lifespan of these derelict nets 
and the extent of potential damage they can inflict on both marine life 
and marine environments. In recent years as derelict nets have become 
more abundant and more durable, research has expanded to investigate 
not only the impacts of derelict nets on the ecosystem, but how to best 
locate, track, and remove nets to prevent them from inflicting further 
harm (McElwee et al., 2012 ). 
One unique marine environment that is impacted by derelict fishing 
nets is the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) — a remote archi -
pelago of islands, atolls, and reef systems that extend 2200 km to the 
northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands and is part of the protected 
Papah ßanaumoku ßakea Marine National Monument established in 2006 
(www.papahanaumokuakea.gov ). This uninhabited island chain in the 
North Pacific Ocean differs from the main Hawaiian Islands in that it is 
dominated by shallow-water lagoons and coral reef ecosystems, rather than emergent land. These shallow-reef systems act as a sieve for derelict 
fishing nets as they are transported by currents through the North Pacific 
Subtropical Convergence Zone. In particular, debris accumulation in the 
NHWI increases when the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone 
dips southward and nears the island chain (Donohue et al., 2001 ; 
Donohue and Foley, 2007 ; Howell et al., 2012 ; Kubota, 1994 ; Morishige 
et al., 2007 ; Pichel et al., 2007 ) which occurs annually in the winter and 
early spring (Howell et al., 2012 ). 
Previous studies in the NWHI have quantified the type, amount, and 
accumulation rate of derelict fishing nets (Boland and Donohue, 2003 ; 
Dameron et al., 2007 ; Donohue et al., 2001 ), and most recently, the 
damaging effects of such nets that snag on and smother corals directly 
beneath them (Suka et al., 2020 ). However, many questions still remain 
about the overall scale of impact on shallow-reef systems caused by 
derelict nets, which require an understanding of the spatial movement 
patterns and extent of retention of nets in the archipelago. While there 
have been models and simulations of movement of floating debris in the 
open waters of the North Pacific based on ocean currents and wind 
patterns (Kubota, 1994 ; Wakata and Sugimori, 1990 ), and although a 
study in 2020 surveyed locations of derelict nets caught by longline 
fishing vessels (Uhrin et al., 2020 ), little has been done to ground-truth 
the application of these models when predicting net movement in and 
around shallow-reef systems of the NWHI.

2Here, we offer a proof-of-concept for successfully tracking nets in 
shallow, coral reef environments to better understand their movement 
through time in these critical habitats. We followed the movement of six 
nets tagged with GPS-enabled satellite buoys over the course of three 
years as a pilot effort for method development. The data collected pro-
vide information on the spatial extent of net movement and the duration 
of time derelict nets remain stationary, ensnared on coral reefs. These 
data can feed into larger collaborative efforts that combine on-site ob-
servations with remote sensing and modeling techniques to improve our 
ability to locate, track, and remove marine debris (Maximenko et al., 
2019 ; McElwee et al., 2012 ). With increased regional knowledge of net 
movement, more money and time can be saved by concentrating clean- 
up efforts in areas where nets are known to most often travel and remain 
stationary, thus having the most impact on reefs. 
2.Methods 
In late September 2018, we attached satellite buoys to conglomerates 
of derelict fishing nets found inside the reef crest at Manawai (also 
known as Holoikauaua or Pearl and Hermes Reef). Manawai is an atoll 
towards the northwestern end of Papah ßanaumoku ßakea that has an outer 
fringing reef, contains several low-lying islands, and is about 30 km 
across at the widest point. Prevailing trade winds intersect the atoll on 
the northeast side, contributing to a broad, shallow area of sandy habitat 
just inside the reef crest that opens up into a lagoon that consists of 800 
km2 of maze-like reticulated coral reef structures. Search efforts for 
suitable nets to tag were concentrated on the northeast side of the atoll, 
where nets are most likely to enter due to those prevailing winds. Nets 
were selected for tagging if F75% of the volume was floating at the 
surface, as opposed to hanging below the surface (Fig. 1), had minimum 
average measurements of 1 m in length, width, and height, and had a 
low fouling level (D50%) indicating that they were recent arrivals to the 
atoll. These metrics were visually estimated by trained divers, and all six 
selected nets were found ensnared on reefs; even though the nets were 
mostly buoyant, the lower portion of each was snagged on the reef. 
Satlink solar-powered satellite buoys (model ISL: https://www.satlink. 
es/en/smart-buoys/satlink-isl-buoy/ ) weighing 13.7 kg with a 40.6 cm 
diameter and 36.8 cm height were affixed to the nets with industrial 
strength nylon zip ties (Fig. 1); otherwise the nets were not moved or 
disturbed. 
The buoys usually transmitted geographic coordinates once every 4 h (range of time between transmissions varied from 1 min to 50 days) until 
transmission ceased potentially due to technical failures, insufficient 
charging of the solar-powered unit, or until the buoys broke free. For 
each transmission period, we considered a net to be stationary if the 
distance traveled from the previous transmission was less than the 
maximum length of the net in order to account for movement in the 
water while the net was still attached to the reef. We then calculated the 
total time and distances that each net was stationary versus moving and 
reported the net movement rates when traveling (km/day). 
In an attempt to ground truth the net locations while they were 
deployed, we partnered with NOAA's National Environmental Satellite 
Data and Information Service (NESDIS) to obtain high-resolution satel-
lite imagery at the last known coordinates of each net, but the images 
were not able to detect any visual anomalies that would indicate marine 
debris on the surface of the ocean. A debris removal mission returned to 
Manawai in September of 2021, and a team visited the last known sta-
tionary locations of the nets. Of the six tagged nets, four nets were 
relocated. All four had broken zip ties, indicating that the buoys had 
broken free. The removal team reported the coordinates of each net, 
which we used to analyze net movement from the deployment time 
through these final stationary positions within the atoll. 
Although we were unable to relocate the other two nets in person, we 
assume that the buoys were still attached due to their slow movement 
rate. In contrast, we determined that the other four buoys broke free 
from their nets based on movement rates 20times greater (11 to 21 
km/day) than buoys with confirmed nets still attached. Hence, we 
truncated the net movement time series to exclude these ‘buoy-only ’ 
trajectories for the subsequent analysis. 
Locations were overlaid on a satellite image of Manawai. Locations 
were downloaded using ELB 3010 Manager v. 2014.6332.42068, data 
were formatted in R v. 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2020 ), and locations were 
mapped using ArcMap v.10.6.1. Data used in this study are available 
through NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (https

.noaa.nodc:0229980 ).

3stay ensnared on a small area of reef for almost three years. The two 
perimeter nets that traveled the farthest from their initial tagged loca-
tion traveled from the barrier reef southwest towards the center (Fig. 2, 
purple and pink tracks) along similar trajectories, although with 
different timing; the pink net began to travel after three days and trav-
eled 2.7 km, while the purple net began to travel after 58 days and 
traveled 4 km. The movement rates of these nets averaged 0.35 km/day. 
Although these two perimeter nets did travel the farthest, they still 
remained stationary for the majority of their time – the purple net 
remaining in the initial tagging location for the majority of its stationary 
time (58%) and the pink net remaining stationary about halfway down 
the track line, and again where the track line ended, for a total of 89% of 
the net's time (Table 1). 
The four interior nets stayed in relatively the same location for nearly 
three years. Although the green net collectively traveled 5 km over that 
period of time, it stayed within 0.15 km of the initial tagging location as 
it drifted back and forth across the reef. Of the four nets that were 
relocated, stationary time ranged from 87 to 99% of the time deployed, 
and their extremely slow movement rate averaged 0.05 km/day. The red 
and yellow nets remained stationary on the same area of reef, while the 
green and blue nets remained within 100 m of the original tagging 
location (Table 1). 4.Discussion 
Satellite buoys can be a useful tool for tracking movement in marine 
environments. Here, we have demonstrated that such tags are effective 
at tracking movement and retention of derelict fishing nets, provided the 
satellite tag is effectively secured to the net. Based on the limited 
number of nets tagged in this study, our results suggest nets which enter 
the atoll from the northeast tend to move southwest at a slow pace (0.35 
km/day) towards the reticulated reef structure in the central interior of 
the atoll, at which point they can remain in place on a single reef for 
extended periods of time (1079 days). This net movement aligns with 
the prevailing wind direction at that time (October –December, Wyrtki 
and Meyers, 1976 ) suggesting wind driven movement until the nets are 
snagged by the numerous reticulated reefs located in the atoll interior. 
Indeed, the four nets tagged in the atoll interior remained stationary for 
F86% of the time they were tracked over three years, and moved only 
12–53 m from the original tagging location. These are likely also con-
servative estimates as we do not know how long these nets were on the 
reef before they were found by our teams. One previous study estimated 
that nets remained in place in the Puget Sound for up to 24 years, 
although the median time was one year (Good et al., 2010 ). This study 
builds on that evidence to show that nets can remain in place for close to 
three years, and remain within the same local reef network for that 
duration.

4While this study has furthered our understanding of net movement, it 
also highlights the need to continue on-site observations of derelict 
fishing nets to further understand the consequences of their retention 
and movement on marine systems. We assume that the stationary nets 
we tracked were ensnared on the underlying coral reef substrate where 
they can negatively impact the corals (Suka et al., 2020 ) and pose 
entanglement hazards to wildlife such as seabirds, sea turtles, monk 
seals, and fish who frequent these reefs (Boland and Donohue, 2003 ; 
Donohue et al., 2001 ; Fowler, 1987 ; Gall and Thompson, 2015 ; Gilardi 
et al., 2010 ; Good et al., 2010 ; Harting et al., 2014 ; Moore et al., 2009 ; 
Triessnig et al., 2012 ). Divers from previous marine debris removal 
missions in Papah ßanaumoku ßakea have released endangered monk seals 
and threatened green sea turtles (James Morioka, pers. com) from 
entanglement in derelict fishing nets. Nets that snag on corals can cause 
breakage, abrasion, tissue loss, and mortality (Al-Jufaili et al., 1999 ; Bo 
et al., 2014 ; Mulochau et al., 2020 ; Patterson Edward et al., 2019 ; 
Richards and Beger, 2011 ; Sheehan et al., 2017 ; Suka et al., 2020 ; 
Valderrama Ballesteros et al., 2018 ). The longer these nets remain sta-
tionary on reefs, the more of a hazard they pose by having an increased 
likelihood of ensnaring and endangering wildlife or smothering and 
damaging corals. 
Traveling derelict fishing nets, like the nets that moved from the atoll 
perimeter towards the interior of the atoll, can also pose hazards to the 
environments they encounter. Drifting nets can entangle migratory 
species, such as dolphins and sea turtles. One comprehensive review of 
marine debris entanglement estimated that 100,000 marine mammals 
died every year from entanglement or ingestion of fishing gear, mainly 
monofilament lines, nets, and ropes (Laist, 1997 ). Another review of ray 
and shark entanglement cited 557 animals from 26 studies, the majority 
of which were entangled in ghost fishing gear, or derelict fishing nets 
(Parton et al., 2019 ). 
The results from our pilot study can assist in informing future net 
removal efforts. This study shows that nets that enter Manawai atoll in 
the northeast quadrant are likely moving with the prevailing winds and 
thus head towards the center of the atoll where they can remain sta-
tionary for years. Subsequent missions to remove derelict nets should 
include effort in areas where nets are known to first enter the atoll in 
order to minimize interactions with various reef ecosystems and pre-
venting encounters with the critical reef habitat in the lagoon interior. In 
addition, focusing effort on the central interior of the atoll where nets 
appear to accumulate throughout the reticulated reef can maximize net 
removal efficiency. 
While the cessation of release from the source of these conglomerate 
nets is ideal, a more achievable local-scale goal is to understand the 
movement and extent of impact nets can have on reefs to increase the 
benefits of removal efforts. If we use satellite tags in the future to track 
net movements, we will research how other industries, such as the purse 
seine industry, attach these monitoring buoys to their fishing nets. We 
also plan to return to Manawai to remove the four nets that were relo-
cated, after which the underlying reefs where nets remained stationary 
can be surveyed and assessed for resulting damage. Lastly, our recent 
findings will inform the next removal mission, so that removal efforts 
can be concentrated on the reticulated reef structure in the center of the 
atoll, and in the northeast quadrant, where nets can be removed prior to 
moving across the shallow reefs towards the center.
