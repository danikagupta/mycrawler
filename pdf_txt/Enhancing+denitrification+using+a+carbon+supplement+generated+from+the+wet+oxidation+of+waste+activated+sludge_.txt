 SUMMARY  
Hydrothermal sludge processing is a branch of sludge treatment technologies finding increased adoption 
in modern sewage treatment processes. These technologies involve the use of elevated temperature 
conditions to desirably alter sludge characteristics in the liquid phase. Benefits of these processes, such 
as thermal hydrolysis pre -treatment, include increased biogas production during anaerobic digestion, 
improved sludge dewaterability, sterilization of sludge, and improved transport operations due to 
desirable rheological enhancements. Sludg e rheology plays a significant role in the design and operation 
of these sludge -handling processes. Despite this, rheological studies related to sludge in hydrothermal 
processing conditions is very scarce. Therefore, a better understanding of sludge’s rheo logical properties, 
especially at the high temperature conditions encountered during hydrothermal processing is required 
for better optimization of these processes.  
This study investigates the rheological characteristics of thickened waste activated sludge  (WAS) in 
thermal hydrolysis (TH) processes. Using in -situ rheometric measurements, changes in the sludge’s flow 
properties due to the impact of treatment conditions (temperature, time, and sludge concentration) were 
examined. These changes were related to  the solubilisation of sludge organics, measured by the chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) of sludge. Based on these observations, equations were derived to predict the 
rheological properties of sludge at various conditions of TH and its link to COD. Furthermore , the 
viscoelastic properties of the thickened, untreated and thermally -treated sludges were studied in order 
to characterize sludge’s solid -like properties. A correlation was proposed to associate sludge’s viscoelastic 
data to flow curve data such that os cillatory measurement techniques could be used to collect steady -
shear data which are traditionally obtained via rotational measurement.   
In-situ rheological measurements revealed WAS behaved as a shear -thinning, yield stress fluid which 
could be describe d by the Herschel -Bulkley model. Despite elevated treatment temperatures (80 – 140 °C), 
Newtonian flow behaviour was not observed at any time in the sludge. The flow behaviour of the sludge 
at all treatment conditions examined could be described by a singl e master curve. This means sludge’s 
flow behaviour was governed by a similar network of physical interactions regardless of its concentration 
or treatment conditions. As a result of TH, the apparent viscosity,  η, and Herschel -Bulkley rheological 
parameters  (yield stress, σc, and consistency index, k) were reduced irreversibly. The extent of this 
reduction followed a linear relationship with treatment temperature. The in -situ values of  η, σ c, and k I 
 were up to 92% lower compared to measurements after the ther mally -treated sludge is cooled to ambient 
temperature.  
In-situ measurements also showed that η, σ c, and k reduced gradually during TH at constant temperature, 
following a logarithmic relationship with treatment duration. This meant the solubilization effects of TH 
were a time -dependent process. At constant time, reduction of η, σ c, and k in situ were described  by a 
linear relationship with increasing sludge temperature (80 – 140 °C). At constant treatment time and 
temperature, η, σ c, and k were increased with sludge concentration (7 – 13 wt%) following a power -law 
relationship. The effectiveness of sludge solub ilisation during TH was not impacted by varying sludge 
concentrations, since the reduction of η, σ c, and k were nearly constant between the different sludge 
concentrations.  
The solubilisation of sludge organics also followed a logarithmic time -dependent b ehaviour as shown by 
increasing values of COD in the soluble phase of the sludge during TH.  This increase in sludge’s soluble 
COD (sCOD) indicated that the rheological changes observed during TH were due to the disintegration of 
sludge’s network structure . Accordingly, linear correlation existed between the reduction of rheological 
parameters ( η, σ c, and k) and the increase in sCOD. This correlation indicates the rheological measurement 
of sludge in situ can be used as a means to monitor the performance of  hydrothermal processes.  
Viscoelastic measurements of the untreated and thermally treated sludges revealed gel -like behaviour in 
the linear viscoelastic region. The frequency and creep response of the sludges were described using a 
fractional Kelvin -Voigt  model (FKV). With increasing treatment temperatures, the storage ( G’) and loss 
(G”) moduli were reduced linearly, further indicating a weakening of structural components in the sludge, 
such as extracellular polymeric substances. This is reflected in the d ecreasing value of energy of cohesion, 
Ec which describes the strength of the three -dimensional sludge network.  
Viscoelastic data, as obtained from dynamic oscillatory measurements of the sludge could be related to 
the flow curve data of the sludge, as ob tained via steady -shear measurements. A modified Cox -Merz 
relationship related the complex viscosity, η*(ω), to the steady shear viscosity, η(γ̇), by applying shift 
factors. More notably, raw values of dynamic viscosity, η’(ω), were nearly equal to η(γ̇) at equivalent shear 
rates. This meant that oscillatory measurement could readily describe steady -shear, flow data. Besides 
that, the yield stress of the sludge could also be estimated from the above shift factors and values of G’. II 
 Finally, the engineering i mplications of this observations and results in this study were discussed, 
highlighting the significance of correct determination of rheological parameters which are needed in the 
design and operation of unit operations.

 CHAPTER 1:  INTRODUCTION

 1.1 PROJECT RATIONALE  
Sewage and wastewater treatment operations are a vital part of any large city and play an important role 
in ensuring the city’s sustainable  growth and environmental performance. However, increasing urban 
populations means that wastewater treatmen t plants (WWTPs) are receiving increasingly larger volumes 
of wastewater . Subsequently, this leads to increasingly large volumes of wastewater sludge which must 
be disposed. Sludge management (treatment and disposal) has become an essential component in 
WW TPs, representing 30-40% capital costs and 50% operating costs (Pilli et al., 2015; Ruffino et  al., 2015) . 
However, d ue to increasingly stringent environmental regulations traditional sludge disposal routes , such 
as landfilling , are quickly becoming unsustainable. This necessitates applying  new strategies and 
technologies t o reduce their amount being landfilled.  
Hydrothermal processing is one branch of technologies which has  become increasingly favourable for the 
pre-treatment, treatment and conversion of sludge . These  involve the use of elevated temperature and 
pressure co nditions under aqueous conditions to achieve various improvements of sludge characteristics.  
Hydrothermal processing of organic wastes has three major objectives based on application: (i) 
enhancement of methanogenic energy production (Baroutian et al., 2012) , (ii) degradation and removal 
of organic compounds from waste and reduction of mass and volume of solid wastes (Strong and Gapes, 
2012) , and (iii) recovering valuable compounds (Strong et al., 2011; Suárez -Iglesias et al., 2017; Yoshida et 
al., 2003) . In conventional sludge treatment via anaerobic digestion, the implementation of hydrothermal 
processing, such as thermal hydrolysis pre -treatment (100 - 180 °C), can lead to significant improvements 
including:  increased biogas production (Camacho et al., 2008) ; improved sludge rheological characteristics  
(Bougrier et al., 2008) ; enhanced dewaterability (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003) ; and positive net energy  
production  in the sludge treatment process (Carrere et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2012; Pérez -Elvira et al., 
2008; Sapkaite et al ., 2017) . 
However, despite nume rous studies on various aspects of hydrothermal processing technologies, ther e is 
a distinct lack of literature about sludge rheology in these processes. An understanding of the 
hydrodynamic behaviour and rheological properties of sludge is of great importance to the optimization 
and design of sludge handling processes as noted by several researchers including Bhattacharya (1981) , 
Slatter (2008) , Baudez and Coussot (2001) , and Mori et al. (2006) . Sludge rheological properties such as 
viscosity , yield stress , and viscoelasticity  are design parameters used in heat and mass transfer operations 
(Pereboom et al., 2014; Seyssiecq et al., 2003) , mixing and power requirements (Yang et al., 2009) ,  
3 
 transport (Hammadi et al., 2012) , dewatering (Lotito et al., 1997)  and pumping (Anderson et al., 2008) . 
Generally, the rheology of sludge at ambient conditions and low to moderate concentrations is w ell 
studied (Eshtiaghi et al., 2013; Ratkovich et al., 2013) ; however, their rheological behaviour at the elevated 
temperature and  pressure conditions of h ydrothermal processing is not understood (Barber, 2016) . A 
fundamental understanding of the rheology in sludge hydrothermal processing can help to better 
optimize its design and operation and  may potentially be useful for real -time monitoring of these 
processes.  
The current thesis aims to investiga te the rheological characteristics  and solubilization  of sludge during 
hydrothermal processing, particularly, with regards to the impact of temperature, treatment time, sludge 
concentration and sludge composition . The relationship between sludge rheologica l changes (e.g. yield 
stress, viscosity) and compositional changes (e.g. organic matter solubilization) are investigated, and the 
influence of treatment parameters (e.g. treatment time and temperature) are also studied . The expected 
outcome of the research  is to develop predictive equations useful for estimation of sludge solubilization 
and rheological parameters at various sludge thermal treatment  conditions , such that they can be used 
to monitor the performance of these processes .   
 
1.2 PROJECT AIMS  
As d escribed previously, the primary objective of this research is the characterisation of sludge 
rheological behaviour in hydrothermal processing,  particularly in non -oxidative temperature ranges of 
treatment (i.e. thermal hydrolysis, <180 °C), as well as their relation to sludge compositional changes. It 
is hoped that this improved understanding can lead to better implementation of hydrothermal 
processing and potentially be used as a method to monitor i ts performance. The research questions to 
be addressed are:  
1. What is the impact of elevated temperature  conditions on the rheological properties  (e.g. flow 
behaviour, apparent viscosity, and yield stress) of thickened waste activated sludge , and h ow do 
these rheological parameters evolve as thermal hydrolysis treatment progresses ? 
2. What is the impact of increasing sludge solids concentration on the  rheological behaviour of waste 
activated sludge during thermal hydrolysis?   
4 
 3. What is the impact of thermal hydrolysis treatment on the flow behaviour and viscoelastic 
characteristics of the thermally -treated sludge, and can the viscoelastic properties be c orrelated 
with flow characteristics?  
4. How is sludge composition changed during thermal hydrolysis, and how is it related to its 
rheological characteristics?  
5. Why does the impact of elevated temperature conditions during thermal hydrolysis result in 
changes i n rheological properties ? 
 
1.3 THESIS OUTLINE  
Following this introductory chapter, a detailed literature review is presented in Chapter 2 regarding the 
background of hydrothermal processing technologies, studies on the rheological behaviour of sewage 
sludg e, and studies on the rheology of sewage sludge in thermal treatment processes. The first part of 
this literature review was published as a peer -reviewed literature review in the Bioresource Journal (Vol: 
155, pp: 289 -299, 2014).  The final part of this cha pter presents the gaps of knowledge identified and the 
areas of investigation in the current research.  
Chapter 3 describes the materials and methodology adopted throughout this study.  Experimental 
considerations and rationale for the protocols adopted are  discussed, where relevant. The preparation of 
sludge samples and its physical characterisation are described. The choice of equipment to perform 
rheological measurements and sludge thermal hydrolysis experiments are also discussed.  
Chapter 4 presents the results and discussion  addressing research questions 1, 4, and 5. In this chapter, 
waste activated sludge rheology was measured for the first time  in situ  at thermal hydrolysis conditions 
to show a direct ly the rheological changes sludge  has undergone.  The impact of treatment temperature 
and time were described, and rheological changes were correlated with changes in sludge composition. 
This chapter  was published as a peer -reviewed original research paper in Water Research Journal (Vol:114, 
pp: 3 – 27, 2017).  
Chapter 5 presents the results and discussion addressing, in particular, research question 2 but also 1, 3, 
and 5. In this chapter, the impact of increasing sludge concentrations on the rheological behaviour of 
waste activated sludge was i nvestigated. A predictive model for estimating sludge rheological parameters  
5 
 during thermal hydrolysis, which incorporates the impact of temperature, treatment time, and sludge 
concentration, is presented. The contents of this chapter are published jointly  with contents of Chapter 6 
in the Water Research Journal  (accepted; doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.039) . 
Chapter 6 addresses research question 3 for various concentrations of waste activated sludge. In this 
chapter, the impact of thermal hydrolysis on t he viscoelastic properties thickened waste activated sludge 
were investigated. The compatibility between viscoelastic measurements and shear flow measurements 
for thickened sludge were also discussed.  The contents of this chapter are published jointly with  contents 
of Chapter 5 in the Water Research Journal  (accepted; doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.039).  
Chapter 7 elaborates on the practical engineering applications of the results presented in this thesis. This 
chapter highlights how the rheological chang es observed in this study can be related to engineering 
solutions in sludge -handling processes.  
Chapter 9 summarizes the conclusions established in this work and their contribution s to knowledge. 
Recommendations and perspectives for further work are also p resented.

 2.1.1 ABSTRACT  
With rapid world population growth and strict environmental regulations, increasingly large volumes of 
sludge are being produced in today’s wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with limited di sposal routes. 
Sludge treatment has become an essential process in WWTP, representing 50% of operational costs. 
Sludge destruction and resource recovery technologies are therefore of great ongoing interest. 
Hydrothermal processing uses unique characteristi cs of water at elevated temperatures and pressures to 
deconstruct organic and inorganic components of sludge. It can be broadly categorized into wet oxidation 
(oxidative) and thermal hydrolysis (non -oxidative). While wet air oxidation (WAO) can be used for  the final 
sludge destruction and also potentially producing industrially useful by -products such as acetic acid, 
thermal hydrolysis (TH) is mainly used as a pre -treatment method to improve the efficiency of anaerobic 
digestion. This paper reviews current hydrothermal technologies, roles of wet air oxidation and thermal 
hydrolysis in sludge treatment, and challenges faced by these technologies.  
 
2.1.2 INTRODUCTION  
Today, rapid world population growth has increased the volume of sewage sludge produced from 
wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) whilst strict environmental regulations have limited their 
disposal (Eshtiaghi et al., 2013). The treatment of sludge has therefore become an essential part 
of today’s WWTPs representing up to 50% of operational costs (Kro iss, 2004; Neyens and Baeyens, 
2003; Spinosa and Vesilind 2001). As such, methods for sludge destruction and resource recovery 
are of ongoing interest. In sludge treatment, processing techniques which utilize the principles 
behind hydrothermal processing h ave been implemented for different purposes and 
accomplished different outcomes in the treatment line. Although these methods have achieved 
varying degrees of success, their relative simplicity and ease of implementation still make them 
attractive enough t o further be investigated for improvement.   
Hydrothermal processing refers to technologies involving reactions carried out in an aqueous 
solvent at elevated temperatures and pressures. This can not only degrade the waste but also 
potentially produce indus trially useful by -products. Since the necessary reactions can be 
completed in the water phase, the need for removing water from the waste prior to processing 
is avoided (Baroutian et al., 2013a). Hydrothermal technologies in sludge treatment can be  
11 
 broadly  categorized into two main groups, oxidative techniques and non -oxidative techniques. 
Catalysts and chemicals may or may not be involved in both cases but the main difference 
between the techniques is the presence of oxidative agents and subsequently the e nd-products 
achieved (Strong et al., 2011).  Wet air oxidation (WAO) is representative of the oxidative 
techniques, and it is usually carried out at high temperatures (>200 °C) in the presence of an 
oxidant. Non -oxidative techniques, such as thermal hydrol ysis (TH), are usually undertaken at a 
lower temperature range (100 °C  – 200 °C) without the addition of oxidants. Although these 
technologies can appear anywhere on the sludge treatment line, TH is normally used as a pre -
treatment step before anaerobic di gestion (AD) whereas WAO is used towards the end of the 
treatment line as a means of final sludge destruction.  Although it is a well -proven process for 
sludge treatment, AD suffers from low efficiency associated with a rate -limiting hydrolysis 
reaction (A ppels et al., 2008). By implementing TH pre -treatment, this hydrolysis step is 
effectively carried out in a separate reactor under optimal conditions provided by the TH process. 
Using high temperatures and pressures, the complex molecular compounds and cel lular content 
of sewage sludge is broken down. This releases intracellular content and water, thus making the 
sludge more digestible. As a result, the digestion efficiency and biogas production during AD is 
improved. This is particularly effective when tre ating waste activated sludge that contains 
bacterial cells, which are not easily biodegradable (Chen et al., 2012). Waste activated sludge is 
known to be difficult to dewater (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003). Therefore, TH would also help for 
dewatering of waste  activated sludge.   
Whereas TH is mainly used as pre -treatment in the sludge treatment line, WAO can be used as 
the final step in complete sludge destruction. Wet air oxidation works by oxidizing organic and 
inorganic substances in an aqueous solution usi ng air or oxygen, which is achievable at high 
temperatures and pressures. The result is that these substances are either broken down into 
simpler components or converted into water and carbon dioxide with complete oxidation. The 
technology is comparable wi th incineration other than the fact that it is completed in the aqueous 
phase, making it very useful for wastes which are too dilute for incineration, such as sewage 
sludge. In contrast to incineration however, harmful emissions such as nitrous oxides (NO x) are 
not released and WAO can be used to treat toxic waste components. Furthermore, since the  
12 
 extent of oxidation is controlled by the severity of operating conditions, the WAO can also be 
controlled to produce useful intermediate products such as acetic acid (Strong et al., 2011).  
In the past decade, WAO and TH processes in waste treatment have been reviewed by different 
authors. For example, the WAO process has been reviewed for the treatment of aqueous wastes 
and industrial wastes by Debellefontaine and  Foussard (2000) which covered topics including its 
history, industrial examples and reactor design.  Similarly, Zou et al. (2007) have also reviewed 
WAO for waste treatment, covering topics such as catalysts and design. Appels et al. (2008) 
reviewed anaer obic digestion and briefly reviewed TH as a pre -treatment process. Carerre et al. 
(2010) also reviewed pre -treatment processes used to improve anaerobic digestion and 
presented TH as one of the methods. In addition, there are some useful review papers on 
different aspects of hydrothermal processing techniques (Table 2.1). However, no work has 
attempted to compare TH and WAO as hydrothermal processes implemented in sludge 
treatment. This paper presents an overview of the emergence and development of hydrothe rmal 
technologies specifically in the field of sludge treatment. In particular TH and WAO are compared, 
showcasing their fundamental differences in terms of process mechanisms, goals and end -
products.

 2.1.3 HYDROTHERMAL P ROCESSING  
The principles behind hydrothermal technologies have long been utilized in many fields and applications 
besides waste treatment. The term “hydrothermal reactions” has been defined as “any heterogeneous 
chemical reaction in the presence of a solvent (whethe r aqueous or non -aqueous) above room 
temperature and at pressures greater than 1 atm in a closed system (Byrappa and Yoshimura, 2001). 
However,  in the context of this review, hydrothermal treatment generally refers to processes involving 
reactions c arried out in water facilitated by high temperatures and high pressures conditions.  
In sludge treatment, hydrothermal processing has four main goals: (i) enhancing anaerobic digestion 
process, (ii) degrading and removing organic compounds, (iii) reducing waste mass and volume and (iv) 
recovering valuable compounds (Baroutian et al., 2013a).  Water plays an important role in hydrothermal 
sludge treatment where it not only acts as solvent for the sludge contents but is also a main reactant for 
the hydrolysis  of the organic compounds in sludge (Toor et al., 2011; Brunner, 2009). At the high 
temperature and high -pressure  conditions usually employed in hydrothermal processes, water has a high 
reactivity and is able to break the chemical bonds in com plex molecules and convert them into simpler 
compounds. This is known as hydrolysis and follows the following reaction (Brunner 2009):  
𝐴−𝐵+𝐻−𝑂𝐻→𝐴−𝐻+𝐵−𝑂𝐻 𝐸𝑞.2.1 
The main steps in WWTPs are generally a pre -treatment followed by primary and secondary treatment. 
During pre -treatment, coarse particles are separated from wastewater by screening. Primary sludge is 
produced in primary treatment when heavy compounds are s ettled by gravity in a primary settler. 
Secondary treatment involves biological treatment and produces a sludge which is highly organic and 
contains large amounts of microorganisms. The activated sludge process is the most popular method for 
secondary trea tment and produces excess sludge known as waste activated sludge (WAS), which is an 
aquatic culture of bacteria and other living organisms. It also contains extracellular polymeric substances 
(EPS) produced by microorganisms in the sludge. The EPS are thre e-dimensional, gel -like, highly hydrated 
and often charged biofilm matrices that can be used to accumulate the microorganisms and cells into 
aggregates known as flocs. The term EPS is generally used to describe a variety of classes of 
macromolecules found to occur on the cell surface of the microorganisms. These compounds include 
polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids (Neyens et al., 2004). The EPS found in WAS are 
predominantly composed of proteins, which may have originated from proteins rele ased from lysed cells 
and entrapped exoenzymes (Liu and Fang, 2003).  Following secondary treatment, the mixture of primary  
15 
 sludge and WAS are usually treated in anaerobic digesters before disposal and digested sludge is produced 
during this digestion proc ess. Wastewater sludge is thus a suspension composed of 1 to 5% of the solid 
waste products generated as a net result of the wastewater treatment process. It is characterized by non -
degraded organics, excess bacterial populations and some minerals. The moi sture content in sludge is 
generally very high (75 – 90 wt%) and the dry matter contains 30 – 40 wt% carbon (Bernardi et al., 2010).   
Extracellular polymeric substances have been found to bind large volumes of water, making WAS 
especially difficult to dew ater, and meaning sludge volumes cannot be reduced easily. Hydrothermal 
treatments are able to break down the structure of EPS to liberate bound water and destroy cell walls 
thus releasing cell contents in the sludge. These changes improve the dewaterabili ty of the sludge and 
make it more susceptible to anaerobic digestion, and the treated sludge is also sterilized (Neyens and 
Baeyens, 2003). Hydrothermal technologies for waste treatment emerged more than 50 years ago with 
the development of the WAO process  for treatment of paper mill liquors.  An early technology, named 
the Zimmerman process or Zimpro®, used air at high pressure to cause combustion of organic compounds 
suspended or dissolved in water. Almost all (95%) of organic matter was removed at temper atures up to 
300 °C and at pressures up to 175 bar. The main products were carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, ash 
and small amounts of acetic acid. A modified version of this process which operated at lower 
temperatures (<200 °C) was later used to treat mu nicipal sludge. This process, called low pressure 
oxidation, involved very little oxidation and is in fact more similar to TH processes (Camacho et al., 2008). 
However, many plants faced issues with corrosion and high energy costs, and eventually closed do wn 
(Odegaard, 2004; Debellefontaine and Foussard, 2000).  
A thermal hydrolysis concept can also be found during the 1960s in the form of the Porteous process, 
which involved applying heat treatment to sludge to improve its dewaterability before incineratio n 
(Camacho et al., 2008). The Porteous process operated at higher temperatures (200 °C) than today’s 
thermal hydrolysis processes and resulted in an end product which could be dewatered to 40 – 60% solids 
content without the aid of chemicals (Hecht and Duv all, 1975). However, technical problems, issues with 
odour  and economic factors have also led to most plants to shut down (Kepp et al., 2000).  
The more recent thermal hydrolysis processes developed by Cambi were a result of research work which 
showed advantages of operating at lower temperatures (150 – 200 °C). The resulting processes were 
designed around an optimum temperature of 170 °C which gave the best compromise between improved 
dewaterability at higher temperatures and better digestibility at lo wer temperatures. Cambi TH processes 
are the most widely used TH processes at present (Maugans and Ellis, 2002; Camacho et al., 2008).   
16 
 The main difference between WAO and TH is that oxidation reactions are desired in WAO processes 
whereas they are not nece ssary in TH processes; oxidation is achieved by the addition of an appropriate 
oxidant such as oxygen gas or hydrogen peroxide. The TH process is largely used as a pre -treatment for 
other processes in the sludge treatment line for its ability to alter slud ge properties. As oxidation is an 
ultimate method for the organic waste destruction, it is typically used as one of the final processes in the 
sludge treatment line. Typical setups for TH and WAO are illustrated in Figure 2.1 (a) and (b).

2.1.4 WET AIR OXIDAT ION (WAO)  
Wet oxidation or wet air oxidation technologies were first commercialized for the production of artificial 
vanilla flavouring  and later for destruction of paper -mill sludge and biological sludge. Today, the 
application of this technology has expan ded – most successfully for treatment of industrial wastes such 
as the caustic solution from scrubbing towers, and for treatment of powdered activated carbon (Maugans 
 
18 
 and Ellis, 2002). Other applications include the production of useful products such as ac etic acid 
(Shanableh, 2000), biofuel from microalgae (Alba et al., 2011) and synthesis of methyl methacrylate 
(Giudici & Maugans, 2000).  
The WAO process can be defined as “the oxidation of organic and inorganic substances in an aqueous 
solution or suspens ion by means of oxygen or air at elevated temperatures and pressures either in the 
presence or absence of catalysts” (Zou et al., 2007).  The main reactions are similar to incineration, and 
any substance that can be incinerated can be oxidized in water via  WAO. The WAO process is therefore 
ideal for treating waste liquors, slurries and sludge where the organic matter is very high in concentration 
compared to water.  Another benefit of the WAO process is that nitrous oxide, sulphur  dioxide, 
hydrochlori c acid, dioxins, furans, and fly ash are not generated. The WAO process is capable of up 99% 
conversion of toxic organics to harmless end products. For compounds which that not completely oxidized, 
intermediate compounds representing up to a quarter of the  original mass of the organic matter are 
formed, such as small carboxylic acids.  
Typical conditions for WAO are temperatures between 150 - 320 °C, at 20 – 150 bar and with a residence 
time 15 – 120 minutes. The type of application is usually determined by  the range of temperatures used. 
Low temperature oxidation (100 – 200 °C) is used for thermal  conditioning of municipal and paper 
industry sludge, whereas medium temperature (200 – 260 °C) oxidation is typically used for treatment of 
ethylene spent -causti cs and some other industrial wastes, as well as for regeneration of powdered 
activated carbon used in wastewater treatment. Higher temperatures (260 – 320 °C) are used for sludge 
destruction and treatment of industrial wastewaters including organic industr ial wastes such as 
pharmaceutical wastes and solvents. At the higher end of this temperature range, complete destruction 
of municipal, pulp and paper and other organic sludge is expected (Giudici & Maugans, 2000). This high 
temperature range is within the sub-critical region for water where the solubility of salts is reduced. 
Precipitated salts may be the cause of the corrosion that was a problem for early Zimpro sludge treatment 
operations. The process of WAO must be undertaken in the aqueous phase so high  pressures are required 
to maintain water as a liquid. Pressurization also increases the concentration of dissolved oxygen and thus 
increases the oxidation rate (Debellefontaine & Foussard, 2000).  
  
19 
 2.1.4.1  KINETICS AND MECHANIS M OF WAO  
The composition of s ewage slud ge can vary greatly but the main components are carbohydrates, proteins 
and lipids. The first stage in the WAO of sludge involves a large proportion of the insoluble or ganic content 
being converted into simpler soluble organics compounds (sugars,  amino acids, fatty acids, etc.). The 
smaller molecules are then oxidized into easily biodegradable and oxygenated products (carbon dioxide, 
inorganic salts and water) (Bernardi et al., 2010). This conversion is achieved through a number of 
hydrolysis and oxidation reactions occurring in series. These series of reactions are propagated by an 
organic radical obtained through oxidation of C -H bonds. The organic radicals produced are able to oxidize 
all organic compounds that contain hydrogen via hydrogen abst raction. The organic compounds are 
gradually decomposed into more stable intermediates which are finally oxidized to carbon dioxide and 
water. The overall reaction rate slows down as the easily oxidized compounds are gradually removed and 
acetic acid and o ther stable intermediates are formed (Imteaz & Shanableh, 2004).  
To simplify the reaction mechanism for WAO, it can be assumed that the destruction of sludge proceeds 
via two pathways – it can proceed either directly or indirectly. In the direct pathway, a ll initial relatively 
unstable intermediates in sludge come into direct contact with oxygen and are converted into carbon 
dioxide. In the indirect pathway, these initial relatively unstable intermediates first undergo hydrolysis to 
form relatively refracto ry intermediates such as acetic acid. These intermediates are later oxidized into 
carbon dioxide. Based on this simplified reaction scheme, Li (1991) developed a generalized kinetic model 
for WAO of organic compounds where production of an intermediate suc h as acetic acid was considered 
to be the rate -limiting step. The overall reaction rate can be calculated according to a general model (Eq. 
2.1), which is true when describing the global reaction rate of any elementary chemical reaction 
(Debellefontaine an d Foussard, 2000; Li et al., 1991).  However, sludge contains a complex mixture of 
compounds. Through the series of reactions involved in WAO, some of the organic compounds are fully 
oxidized, whereas some are transformed to intermediate products of lower reactivity.  
The generalized kinetic model of Li et al. (1991) is given in Eq. 2.2, which describes the change in 
concentration of organic compounds over time. The concentrations for A and B can be expressed in terms 
of total organic carbon (TOC), chemical  oxygen demand (COD), or total oxygen demand (TOD). This model 
takes into account the formation and destruction of rate -controlling intermediates, based on the 2 -
pathway reaction scheme described previously. It was decided that the global rate for WAO depe nded on 
the formation rate of final oxidation products as well as the formation and destruction rates of low - 
20 
 reactivity intermediates. This was due to the relatively high activation energies of these intermediates, 
which are represented by acetic acid, met hanol and ethanol.

Imteaz and Shanableh (2004) have developed a model for the WAO of wastewater sludge using a 
simplified first -order reaction scheme. The proposed alternative WAO reaction model aimed to pres ent a 
more convenient method to describe the oxidation of sludge. Instead of describing the WAO process in 
terms of oxidation of unstable and stable compounds, the authors simplified the reaction scheme in terms 
of solubilisation and oxidation of all the C OD in sludge. Here, it is assumed that the destruction of COD 
proceeds via a single pathway involving two reaction steps. Any solid COD in the sludge must first 
solubilize via hydrolysis before it can come into contact with the oxidants and finally oxidize . The global 
reaction model proposed is shown in Eq. 2.4:

Both models presented here are suitable for describing the WAO process. The model proposed by Li et al. 
(1991) is more representative of the kinetics of WAO processes. However,  it is more complex and requires 
good understanding of  the contents of treated sludge, which may sometimes be impractical. On the other 
hand, the model proposed by Imteaz and Shanableh (2004) is much simpler but gave some inconsistent 
predictions in terms of effluent COD.   
 Several other models have also bee n proposed however, they are will not be described in detail 
for the purpose of this review. An early study on WAO of sewage sludge by Ploos van Amstel and Rietema 
(1973) produced a model which could be used for the design of large -scale  reactor s. This model assumed 
that the sludge consisted of three groups of components which were of high reactivity, intermediate 
reactivity and no reactivity at all. The effect of hydrolysis on the overall conversion was neglected and the 
reactions were assumed t o be first order.  When the model results compared to the results obtained from 
a large scale WAO installation (200 tons per day of dry sludge), the model predicted a COD reduction value 
with 1% error compared to the actual value.  
 Verenich et al. (2002; 2003) have developed a lumped kinetic model for WAO treatment of organic 
wastewaters. The mechanism proposed considered the degradation of organics into end products. The 
refractory compounds were considered to undergo two parallel reactions. The first one  would lead to the 
formation of oxidation end -products and the second one would lead to organic compounds, which are 
degraded to biologically oxidizable large molecules. These large molecules will undergo further 
transformation into smaller biodegradable compounds which are finally be oxidized into end products.  
 
2.1.4.2  WAO  TREATMENT CONDITION S 
Wet air oxidation processes typically take place at temperatures between 150 – 320 °C and pressures 20 
– 150 bar. Researchers have considered  supercritical water technologies as a part of WAO technologies 
(Fytlili and Zabaniotou, 2008; He et al., 2008; Zou et al., 2007) or as an alternative (Bermejo and Cocero, 
2006). Fytlili and Zabanioutou, (2008) described the WAO process as “occurring in tw o distinctive regimes”,  
22 
 with the first occurring at sub -critical conditions for water (below 374 °C temperature and 100 bar 
pressure) and the second occurring at supercritical conditions for water (above 374 °C temperature and 
220 bar pressure).  
Maugan an d Ellis (2002) divided the typical range of WAO temperatures used for various applications, into 
low (100 – 200 °C), medium (200 – 260 °C) and high (260 – 320 °C). The high temperature range is 
commonly used for sludge destruction and industrial wastewater  treatment. The range of low 
temperatures is used for sludge -conditioning purposes. However,  oxidation is unlikely to occur at low 
temperatures and these processes are, in fact, thermal hydrolysis processes. The WAO process typically 
becomes energet ically self -sufficient at medium and high temperature ranges.  
It has been noted that COD reduction in sludge is primarily a function of temperature and the type of 
sludge being treated. Up to 20% variation in COD reduction can be identified between primary , secondary 
and digested sludge when treated under a given reaction temperature, whilst secondary sludge was found 
to be most resistant to oxidation (Lendormi et al. 2001). Many researchers have highlighted the influence 
of temperature and reaction time on  the performance of WAO (Baroutian et al., 2013b; Chung et al., 2009; 
Lendormi et al., 2001; Shanableh, 2000). Shanableh (2000) reported that COD removal from the sludge 
increased as temperature increased in the range of 280 – 460 °C, with 67 – 97% COD red uction achievable. 
The author noted that COD removal was also dependent on reaction time. However, COD removal was 
limited to 85% at temperatures below 300 °C (sub -critical water oxidation) even after 1 hour of reaction 
time. This was due to the generation  of thermally resistant by -products, mainly acetic acid and ammonia, 
at the lower temperatures. At supercritical conditions however, COD removal above 99.9% was possible 
within 10 minutes of reaction time at 450 °C temperature. Similarly, Lendormi et al. ( 2001) reported that 
at temperatures of 240 °C, COD reduction is limited to 70% whereas COD removal efficiencies greater 
than 80% is achievable at 300 °C without the addition of catalysts.  
More recently, Chung et al. (2009) investigated the effects of oper ational conditions on sludge 
degradation and organic acids formation. Reaction time and temperature was again found to be important 
factors affecting liquefaction of volatile solids. The degradation efficiency of sludge and formation of 
organic acids was i mproved with longer reaction time and higher temperatures. The high temperatures 
accelerate sludge dissolution whereas high pressures increased the solubility of the oxidizing agents, such 
as oxygen – both of which speed up sludge liquefaction. The authors  found optimal conditions to be 240 °C 
temperatures, 60 bar pressure and 30 minutes reaction time.   
23 
 Baroutian et al., (2013b) examined individual and interactive effects of process variables on the 
degradation of fermented municipal sludge during wet oxida tion. It was found that temperature has the 
most significant effect on degradation rate throughout. During the near completion stage, the interaction 
of temperature and oxygen ratio had significant effect on sludge degradation.  
In recent years, work has be en done on developing wet oxidation under milder conditions and lower 
pressure (Abe et al., 2013; Abe et al., 2011). Wet air oxidation treatment at 150 °C temperature, 10 bar 
pressure and 2 hours reaction was able to give a 62% volatile suspended solids (V SS) removal efficiency. 
This lower pressure WAO process was considered as a sludge pre -treatment process to improve the sludge 
characteristics for anaerobic digestion.  Studies suggested that an excessive concentration of oxygen used 
in the reaction led to  production of recalcitrant soluble organics and toxic compounds and can reduce gas 
production in anaerobic digestion (Abe et al., 2013). Typically, catalysts will lower reaction temperatures 
and pressures to be used to achieve the same results as those ac hieved without catalysts in WAO 
processes. Refractory compounds such as acetic acid and ammonia also become more susceptible to 
oxidation (Luck, 1999). Catalytic wet oxidation techniques are beyond the scope of this paper.  
 
2.1.4.3  IMPACT OF WAO  ON SLUDGE DIGESTION EFFICIENCY  
The Zimpro® process was the first commercial WAO process and several large WAO plants were built in 
the early 1960s for the treatment of municipal sludge to either improve the dewaterability of sludge or to 
achieve complete oxidation i n the sludge. More than 130 Zimpro® units had been installed around the US 
and Europe. Most of these were used for conditioning sludge by partially oxidizing the organic fractions 
such that the sludge flocs are broken to release bound water. Sludge conditi oning was performed at 210 
– 240 °C, whereas for sludge destruction temperatures of 250 – 270 °C at 85 – 120 bar pressures were 
used; air was the usual oxidant used (Luck, 1999). Information regarding more recent applications of WAO 
sludge technologies is relatively scarce despite it often being mentioned for sludge treatment.  Some 
examples of results achieved via WAO are provided in Table 2.2.  
Lendormi et al. (2001) studied the application of WAO for treatment of municipal sewage sludge in tests 
carried o ut a pilot scale plant. Chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency greater than 80% was achieved 
at 300 °C without the use of catalysts. However,  it was found that at lower temperatures around 240 °C, 
the process produced foam which impaired the reac tor operation. The lower temperatures also generated 
compounds that are resistant to oxidation.   
24 
 Genç et al. (2002) investigated WAO for pre -treatment of digested and secondary sludge before aerobic 
digestion and its effect on the sludge biodegradability. Hydrogen peroxide was used as the oxidant with 
copper and manganese salts used as catalysts. Temperatures of 120 °C at 2 bar pressure were used to 
solubilize the sludge organics. The liquid phase organics concentration, measured in terms of total organic 
carbon (TOC) was found to increase by 16.5 % after 10 minutes, whereas an increase of 66% was achieved 
after 120 minutes of treatment. The biodegradability was not changed for digested sludge but was 
increased for activated sludge. The final solids volume w as also reduced by 80% after treatment.  
Zhu et al. (2004) investigated the digestion of mixture of primary and surplus sludge using wet oxidation 
without catalysts. WAO experiments were carried out in an autoclave at 250 °C temperature and holding 
times ra nging between 30 to 120 minutes. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) digestion efficiency was 
around 94 -96%. However, the product liquid contained large amounts of organic matter content.  
Strong et al. (2011) compared WAO to thermal hydrolysis processes a s a pre -treatment for mesophilic 
anaerobic digestion on a mixture of primary and secondary sludge. Wet air oxidation of Sludge was carried 
out in a high -pressure  reactor at 220 °C temperature, 20 bar pressure and 2 hours reaction time. Volatil e 
suspended solids destruction of 93% and total suspended solids (TSS) destruction of 83% was achieved. 
The soluble COD found in the product was lower compared to that found in thermal hydrolysis due to the 
oxidation of these solubilized compounds under WA O.  The production of acetic acid was also found to 
be greater in WAO than thermal hydrolysis.  
Abe et al. (2011) compared several pre -treatment methods to improve thermophilic digestion of residual 
sludge including low pressure wet oxidation. Wet air oxida tion experiments were carried out in an 
autoclave for 2 hours with oxygen supplied in amounts corresponding to 0 – 120% of the theoretical 
oxygen required for oxidizing the carbon content of the sludge. Volatile suspended solids removal 
efficiencies of 62%  at 150 °C and 94% at 250 °C temperature were achievable and this can be increased 
when the oxygen supply was increased.  
Abe (2013) compared the effectiveness of thermal treatment to WAO under mild conditions for the pre -
treatment of secondary sludge before thermophilic anaerobic digestion. Wet air oxidation was carried out 
in an autoclave under 150 °C temperatures and at 5 – 14 bar pressure for 2 hours. The treatment achieved 
77% VSS digestion efficiency and the gas production was highest at 150 °C treatment with 40% of 
theoretical oxygen supplied.

 2.1.4.4  PRODUCTION OF USEFUL BY-PRODUCTS IN WAO  
It is well known that the WA O process is able to produce chemical products such as volatile fatty acids 
(VFA), mainly acetic acid, which can be recovered for use. The production of acetic acid using WAO at sub -
critical conditions was investigated by Shanableh (2000) for use as the or ganic reactants necessary in 
denitrification processes in WWTPs. The WAO effectively hydrolyses sludge solids but achieves 
incomplete oxidation of the organic components. This produced COD -rich liquors containing 10% wt/wt 
acetate, which accounted for up t o 80% of soluble COD. Strong et al. (2011) using WAO process at 220 °C 
was able to obtain a slightly higher production of acetic acid (15% wt/wt). Chung et al. (2009) determined 
that the formation of organic acids increased with reaction temperature. More organic acids were formed 
as intermediates when the reaction temperature increases. Acetic acid production increased by four times 
as temperature was increased from 180 °C to 240°C, at 40-minute  reaction time.   
He et al. (2008) undertook a compreh ensive review on resource recovery from organic wastes using 
hydrothermal treatment. The author described the mechanism for the formation of various compounds 
from hydrothermal processing of organic wastes. Acetic acid was identified as the main intermedia te 
product. Jin et al. (2005) suggested a two -step process to improve acetic acid production which consisted 
both of a hydrothermal reaction process in the absence of oxygen and a reaction process with oxidant 
supplied afterward. In the first step, the for mation of furans is accelerated as the oxidation of these 
compounds leads to large amounts of acetic acid. In the second step, these furans are further converted 
to acetic acid by oxidation with fresh supplies of oxygen. The acetic acid obtained was of a h igh purity.  
Aggrey et al. (2011) developed a two -stage hydrothermal process based on the two -step concept 
proposed by Jin et al. (2005) which is a series combination of TH and WAO processes operated at the same 
reaction temperature of 220 °C. This process was specifically developed with the intention of maximizing 
acetic acid production and it was compared to TH at 140 °C and WAO at 220 °C. The WAO process achieved 
yield and purity of acetic acid of 12% and 38% respectively. On the other hand, the two -stage  process 
achieved 8% yield and purity of 25%.   
These works highlight the potential of using WAO to produce acetic acid from sludge. The production of 
useful chemical products may become an incentive for the implementation of WAO processing in sludge 
treat ment, as research continues on the conditions which affect the production of acetic acid in WAO 
processing of sludge.

 2.1.4.5  COMMERCIAL EXAMPLES O F WAO  
Currently, few examples of commercial WAO plants are operational for the treatment of sludge as many 
of the early plants have shut down due to commercial reasons and technical issues. Debellefontaine (2000) 
gave an overview of some of the earlier facilities which were made up of technologies such as the Loprox 
®, Zimpro ®, Athos™ and VerTech processes.  
The Athos process by Veolia Water (Veolia, 2013) is one of the main WAO sludge treatment technologies 
currently provided commercially. The process operates at temperatures between 250 -300 °C, using air or 
pure oxygen as the oxidant. The process is claimed to  produce mineral products, clean gas emissions, and 
biodegradable liquids. Reference plants are available in Belgium, Italy and France.  
Chauzy et al. (2010) reported that he Athos process was in use in a WWTP in North Brussels, Belgium. It 
is used as a fi nal sludge -destruction process located in the sludge treatment line after the anaerobic 
digestion of sludge, which was pre -treated by thermal hydrolysis. The process is exothermic and becomes 
energetically self -sufficient after start -up. The process was al so designed so that it was integrated into the 
plant’s energy recovery scheme where the heat produced from WAO is used to produce hot water used 
to heat buildings and to operate dryer plate filter.

 2.1.4.6  SUPERCRITICAL WATER T ECHNOLOGIES  
Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is basically an evolution of the WAO process where the operating 
temper ature is increased beyond the critical temperature of water. However, because supercritical water 
behaves very differently to sub -critical water, many of the reactions and mechanisms in SCWO would be 
different from WAO. The SCWO process has been used for t he treatment of various wastes (Brunner, 2009) 
including sludge, but for the moment in -depth review of SCWO technologies are outside the scope of this 
paper. Nevertheless,  SCWO is showing promise and is being continually developed for applicati on in 
sludge treatment.  
Cabeza et al. (2013) gives one example of SCWO process used in sewage sludge treatment. Here the 
destruction of sludge was achieved by SCWO in a hydrothermal flame regime, where at operating 
temperatures above autoignition temperatu re, the SCWO reaction proceeds in the form of flames. 
Reaction times can be as little as in the order of milliseconds and the process does not emit hazardous 
gases, unlike incineration. Furthermore, this technology can successfully achieve destruction of a mmonia, 
which cannot be achieved via WAO alone.  
On the other hand, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is another process similar to SCWO except it 
occurs in the absence of oxygen, and hence does not involve oxidation. Water splitting, steam reforming, 
and water -gas shift reactions are the main reactions involved in SCWG. This process has been applied to 
treat primary sewage sludge (Wilkinson et al., 2012), which results in a vapour product containing water, 
carbon dioxide, methane and hydroge n. However, the technology is energy intensive compared to 
traditional AD sludge treatment processes.  
 
2.1.5 THERMAL HYDROL YSIS (TH)  
Thermal hydrolysis (TH) and related heat treatment processes have long been used in sludge treatment, 
although for differen t purposes. Traditionally, sludge from wastewater treatment processes were simply 
dewatered and disposed immediately. Thermal hydrolysis was originally used for conditioning the sludge 
and improving its dewaterability. Early research on TH processes began as early as the 1970s aimed at 
improving the settleability and filterability of sludge by altering the sludge’s physical characteristics. 
Thermal hydrolysis was found to destroy the structural integrity of microbes in the sludge and cause the 
lysis of cell  walls, which released cell contents. Higher temperatures and treatment times were found to 
destroy more cell walls and insoluble proteins could also be broken down into more soluble amino acids.  
29 
 Later, it was realized that combining thermal pre -treatment with anaerobic digestion could potentially 
improve biogas production and remove odour. Early tests on both the laboratory and pilot -scale showed 
good results. Anaerobic digestion has today become a promising method for sludge treatment and TH is 
an importa nt pre -treatment method to improve the efficiency of the process, especially for the digestion 
of WAS. Essentially, under high temperature conditions (130 – 200 °C), a hydrolysis reaction occurs to 
break down complex molecules in sludge into simpler compou nds. This results in the improved 
bioavailability of sludge contents for AD (Strong et al., 2011; Li & Noike, 1992).  
 
2.1.5.1  KINETICS AND MECHANIS M OF THERMAL HYDROLY SIS 
The TH process relates to the thermal decomposition of the sludge contents without th e occurrence of 
oxidation and solid matter becomes soluble. Takamatsu et al. (1970) presented one of the earliest works  
in establishing a mathematical model to describe thermal decomposition of WAS. Because sludge is 
composed of very complex compounds,  the mathematical model proposed represents the thermal 
decomposition reaction in terms of four components. These take into account the solid matter, soluble 
matter (evaporative and non -evaporative) and water. Experiments were carried out on WAS in an 
auto clave at temperatures 170 - 250 °C, and pressures 60 – 130 bar and without introducing oxygen. The 
COD in the solids were found to decrease and in the soluble matter, COD was increased. The total COD in 
the sludge however remained unchanged.  
The reactions  occurring during thermal decomposition were described by Takamatsu et al. (1970) in terms 
of solubilisation of solid matter into soluble evaporative matter and soluble non -evaporative matter. The 
differentiation between evaporative and non -evaporative mat ter was only relevant within the context of 
the author’s experiment due to limitations in experimental procedure. Evaporative matter was described 
as matter lost during drying at 120 °C temperature.   
Based on the assumption that the rate constants are of the Arrhenius type, the mathematical models for 
thermal decomposition based on changes in weight was given as:

and Awt, Bwt, Cwt are the weights of components A (solid matter) , B (Soluble non -evaporative matter), 
and C (soluble evaporative matter) in mg/kg -total -sludge.   
 In their review on subcritical hydrothermal technologies, Toor et al. (2011) have identified a large 
number of studies on the reaction pathways of components typically found in biomass such as sewage 
sludge. These components include carbohydrates, lignin, protein and lipids. Based on individual studies 
on the degradation mechanisms of these components, a basic reac tion mechanism in subcritical water 
was described.  The first step of reaction involves depolymerisation of the sludge molecules. This was 
followed by decomposition of the resultant monomers via cleavage, dehydration, decarboxylation  and 
deamination. The reactive fragments produced are then recombined. Since sludge is a complex waste 
with varying compositions, the parameters affecting the reaction rates of each individual component in 
sludge will likely affect the kinetics of the overall pr ocess and should be taken into consideration. For 
example,  the authors identified that the hydrolysis of carbohydrates are rapid under hydrothermal 
conditions, although the hydrolysis rates vary between different types of carbohydrates.  
More recent ly, Imbierowicz and Chacuk (2012) developed a lumped kinetic model for WAS 
thermohydrolysis which suggested that during heating of WAS, two parallel first -order reactions would 
occur. The first one related to the thermal destruction and solubilisation of s ludge particles to organic 
carbon while the second parallel reaction produced a new solid phase, which may further decompose  into 
carbon dioxide gas. It was found that reaction temperatures strongly impacted the decrease in the 
concentration of o rganic carbon in the solid phase as well as solubilisation of particulate organic matter.  
 
2.1.5.2  TH TREATMENT CONDITION S 
Table 2.2 presents the outcomes of TH sludge treatment under associated treatment conditions. Similar 
to WAO, treatment time and temp erature are the most important parameters which determine the 
performance of the TH process.  Several researchers have performed work over the last few decades to 
determine the effect of temperature and reaction time on WAS thermal treatment and the best c onditions 
for the process. Most studies have agreed that the optimal range of temperature lies between 160 –  
31 
 180 °C to achieve increased methane yield in subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD), but at higher 
temperatures the biodegradability of sludge is redu ced sharply (Bougrier et al., 2008).  
Li and Noike (1992) investigated the effect of TH pre -treatment on the degradation of WAS in anaerobic 
digestion in batch and continuous experiments. The pre -treatment temperature ranged between 62 – 
175 °C with treatme nt times between 15 – 60 minutes. It was found that solubilisation generally increased 
as temperature was increased. More precisely, the solubilisation of carbohydrate and protein were found 
to increase as the treatment temperature increased from 120 °C to  175 °C. At a given temperature 
carbohydrate had greatest solubilisation, followed by protein and lipid. This showed that the degree of 
solubilisation achieved is dependent on the kinds of organic compounds present in WAS. Furthermore, 
the COD removal effi ciency from WAS greatly increased with thermal pre -treatment and increased with 
temperature between 120 – 170 °C. Above 170 °C, the COD removal efficiency was found to decrease, 
indicating that an optimum  of 170 °C. The author concluded that for a sl udge treatment system comprised 
of TH before anaerobic digestion, the  optimal time for TH was between 30 – 60 minutes for increasing 
methane production from WAS. A reaction temperature between 150 – 175 °C improved anaerobic 
degradability of  WAS and methane production. Furthermore, the retention time necessary for anaerobic 
digestion can be reduced.  
Similarly, Carrere et al. (2010) notes that most studies report optimum TH temperatures between 160 – 
180 °C under treatment times of 30 – 60 min utes. Treatment times of 1 minute were also possible in this 
temperature range (Dohányos et al., 2004) while treatment at much lower temperatures (70 °C) will 
require up to several days (Gavala et al., 2003, Ferrer et al., 2010). Dwyer et al. (2008) also f inds that above 
150 °C, no increase in methane production resulted despite increased solubilisation. Treatment 
temperatures above 170 – 190 °C in fact decrease the biodegradability of sludge.  
Recently, Donoso -Bravo et al. (2011) studied the influence of T H reaction time on sewage sludge 
composition and anaerobic digestion performance. Pre -treatment time was varied between 0 to 30 
minutes under treatment temperature of 170 °C. The hydrolysis time was concluded to result in very small 
improvements with regar ds to sludge solubilisation but greatly improves its dewaterability.  
 
2.1.5.3  EFFECT OF TH ON BIOGAS PRODUCTIO N 
Increased methane and biogas production from anaerobic digestion is the primary goal of TH processes 
in sludge treatment today because not only are the resources in sludge being recovered, but the energy  
32 
 which can be produced from the increased methane can  be used to make the TH process energetically 
neutral. This means that identifying the factors which affect methane yield through TH is of great interest.  
Haug et al. (1978) finds that for WAS, gas production from anaerobic digestion increases as TH pre-
treatment  temperatures increased up to 175 °C. At 100 °C, methane production was increased 14% 
whereas at 175 °C, up to 70% increase could be expected. Above this temperature, inhibitory materials 
are produced which reduced gas production. For W AS, it was particularly evident that after TH pre -
treatment at 175 °C, the sludge contained toxic materials which reduced gas production in anaerobic 
digestion. This toxicity can be overcome by feeding a diluted sludge containing only 4% solids. Increased 
methane production was also accompanied by increased VSS reduction. For primary sludge, TH pre -
treatment did not increase methane production significantly. Li and Noike (1992) also found that the gas 
production increased after TH pre-treatment , but the gas production rate decreased with increasing 
retention time in the anaerobic digester. The gas production increased with increasing temperature 
between 120 – 170 °C but decreased slightly at 175 °C. The increase of gas production was nearly doub le 
for pre -treatment temperatures between 150 – 175 °C.  
More recently, Pérez -Elvira et al. (2008) studied TH and anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions 
in a pilot -scale study. Pre -treatment temperatures of 170 °C and reaction time of 30 minutes w as used to 
give a 40% increase in biogas production under half the residence time in anaerobic digestion. In another 
study pilot -scale study combining TH with mesophilic anaerobic digestion, Pérez -Elvira and Fdz -Polanco 
(2012) reported a 33% biogas product ion increase under 17 days residence time. Even at half this 
residence time, the biogas production was still 24% greater compared to conventional anaerobic digestion. 
Qiao et al. (2011) investigated the biogas production using different wastes in the lab -scale using 
hydrothermal pre -treatment at 170 °C temperature and 1-hour  reaction time. The biogas production 
increased 67.8% for municipal sewage sludge after hydrothermal treatment. Wilson et al. (2011) reported 
biogas production increase between 24 – 59% after thermal pre -treatment at temperatures 150 – 170 °C 
and 5 – 8 bar pressure when compared with conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion.  
Most researchers generally agree that an optimum temperature for TH lies somewhere around 175 °C, 
without  the addition of catalysts, to increase the solubilisation of sludge solids and to improve the 
digestibility of the sludge. Temperatures above this would have inhibitory effects in terms of digestibility 
and biogas production.  
  
33 
 2.1.5.4  ENERGY REQUIREMENT O F TH 
Thermal hydrolysis processes generally require an input of energy to maintain the reaction temperatures 
whereas WAO which is exothermic and becomes autothermal at high enough temperatures. In many 
cases, this energy requirement will impact on the impl ementation of TH processes in sludge treatment 
systems. This energy requirement needs to be overcome by the increased rate of biogas production by 
implementing TH pre -treatment. Careful design of the system to recover excess heat will also be necessary 
for the TH process to be implemented economically. Haug (1978) performed energy balances for TH and 
an anaerobic digestion system to treat WAS and mixed primary/secondary sludge. In case of WAS, a 70% 
increase in gas production rate was expected and required in this system to obtain a net energy 
production when an anaerobic digestion followed TH pre -treatment. A thorough energy balance study 
was also carried out by Pérez -Elvira et al. (2008), which considered different configurations of the TH and 
anaerobic di gestion system as well as different options for energy integration. Without implementing an 
energy integration scheme, it was found that the feed concentration of sludge must be increased (from 
3% to 7% total solids) in order to produce enough biogas in th e system for the process to become 
energetically self -sufficient. An energy integration scheme which considered heat recovery from the flash 
vapor outlet of the TH reactor can lower the required feed concentration. It was also found out that only 
TH of WAS  is beneficial rather than the mixture of primary sludge and WAS to be pre -treated using TH. 
This scheme can help a 30% increase in biogas production to achieve net energy production.  
 
2.1.5.5  COMMERCIAL EXAMPLES O F TH 
Currently, Cambi, a Norwegian compan y and French company, Veolia Water are the main companies 
providing TH technologies for sludge treatment. The Cambi process treats sludge under pressure (4.5 bar) 
at temperatures between 150 – 180 °C and improves both the digestibility and dewaterability o f sludge 
but avoids issues with corrosion and refractory compounds encountered in higher temperature processes. 
Sludge is first dewatered to 17% dry solids before it is heated using recycled steam. The reaction time is 
up to 30 minutes and after reaction, the treated sludge is flashed into a flash tank. This technology has 
been implemented in a large number of wastewater treatment plants globally and especially in Europe.  
Veolia Water also provides continuous and batch systems of TH processes combined with anaerobic 
digestion. These are marketed under the names of Exelys™ and Biothelys™ respectively and currently,  
34 
 one prototype plant is operating in France using reaction temperature 165 °C, 9 bar pressure and reaction 
time up to 30 minutes.  
 
2.1.6 UPCOMING T ECHNOLOGIES  
Many interesting technologies based on the hydrothermal concept are continually being developed for 
application in sewage sludge treatment. Some of these incorporate ideas from both TH and WAO, blurring 
the lines between oxidative and non -oxida tive hydrothermal processes. One such technology is the 
advanced thermal hydrolysis (ATH) concept developed by Abelleira et. al (2012). The ATH process can 
fundamentally be viewed as a modification of the TH process which combines TH with hydrogen peroxide  
addition. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidant, and when combined with steam injection used in TH 
causes a synergistic effect which achieves desirable sludge treatment effects. Like in TH, the ATH process 
achieves solubilisation of sludge solids and im proves sludge dewaterability. However, both solubilisation 
and dewaterability are markedly better in the ATH process, with solubilisation up to twice as much 
improved. Furthermore, organic matter removal is achievable due to oxidation reactions occurring ( 85 - 
92% organic matter removal at 170 °C, and stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide dosage). This means ATH 
process can also potentially be used as a final destruction method, similar to WAO. However, if used as a 
pre-treatment process to AD, the methane produ ction is not necessarily improved and, in some cases,  
decreased. Therefore, further research is required to determine the operating conditions which facilitate 
methane production. ATH is nonetheless a very promising technology as it operat es under relatively mild 
conditions compared to TH and WAO without the addition of catalysts and still achieves comparable 
results.  
On the other hand, a hydrothermal treatment concept has been used to convert sludge into solid residues 
(Escala et. al 2013;  Shi et al., 2013). This hydrothermal treatment involves heating sludge in a water 
medium up to temperatures of 210 °C and allowing build -up of saturation pressure. Under these 
conditions the sludge is broken down over a number of reactions includin g hydrolysis, dehydration, 
decarboxylation, polymerization and aromatisation . The result is a solid residue, water, and carbon 
dioxide. The solid residue (hydrochar) can be used as a solid fuel or use as a soil amendment for 
agricultural appli cation. These technologies are more or less similar to TH although they operate at higher 
temperatures and generally longer reaction times. These technologies are intended as final solutions for 
sludge treatment rather for improvement of current sludge tre atment lines.   
35 
 2.1.7 FUTURE WORK  
Hydrothermal processing technologies have been shown to provide significant benefits and 
improvements to existing sludge treatment methods. Thermal hydrolysis greatly enhances anaerobic 
digestion with potential to increase biogas production by 40% at a half the residence time (Perez -Elvira et 
al. 2008). The rheological characteristics of sludge are also improved,  and dewatering is enhanced (Ahn et 
al., 2008; Chauzy et al. 2007). On the other hand, WAO is a very effec tive sludge reduction process which 
can also be used to convert wastewater sludge into useful products.  
However, both TH and WAO are energy -intensive processes which may make them economically 
infeasible for sludge treatment. Further work should be focuse d on methods to make them less energy 
intensive . Several research works such as those by Pérez -Elvira and Fdz -Polanco (2012) have investigated 
ways to integrate these processes into the overall sludge treatment line that optimizes the recyc ling of 
excess heat. This was done by looking at different configurations of the processes within the overall 
treatment process. This will be especially useful for WAO processes since the oxidation reactions are 
exothermic and the excess heat can be recove red for use elsewhere.   
Thermal hydrolysis has been implemented commercially successfully, however further work needs to be 
done on describing the process and reaction kinetics. This can help to further optimize the process which 
may lead to increased bio gas yields and reduced energy requirements.  
Wet air oxidation has historically suffered from issues with corrosion at high operating temperatures. 
Catalytic WAO may be investigated in detail to help solve this issue by allowing milder operating 
conditions . The production of acetic acid has also shown potential benefit for further commercial 
development of WAO.  Further work on maximizing acetic acid production following Jin et al.’s study (2005) 
would be beneficial.  
 
2.1.8 CONCLUSION  
Hydrothermal technolo gies involving high temperature and high -pressure  reactions in water play 
increasingly substantial roles in sludge treatment. Wet air oxidation (oxidative) is mainly used for final 
sludge destruction whereas TH (non -oxidative) is used as a pre -treatment method to improve subsequent 
sludge treatment proce sses. The optimal TH temperature range is between 170 - 180°C, increasing biogas 
production by 40%. The TH and WAO processes have been reviewed with regards to their development  
36 
 in sludge treatment, reaction kinetics, commercial examples, operational speci fics and unique 
characteristics. Differences and similarities between both processes were presented. Future works for 
improving both processes were recommended.

 2.2 LITERATURE REVIEW O N SLUDGE RHEOLOGY.  
 
2.2.1 RHEOLOGY  
Rheology refers to the study of flow and deformation of materials. All materials can be characterized 
rheologically as being in between two extremes of behaviour: ideally viscous liquids and ideally elastic 
solids. All real materials behave with a combinat ion of both viscous and elastic portions. Hence,  they are 
described as having viscoelastic behaviour. Rheological experiments reveal information about the flow 
behaviour of liquids and also the deformation behaviour of solids. Rheometry describes the system of 
measurements used to collect rheological data, including measuring systems, instruments, and test and 
methods of analysis. Different types of tests are used for obtaining different rheological information from 
liquids and solids. Tests are genera lly categorized into rotational and oscillatory types. Viscous behaviour 
is generally described using rotational tests, whereas viscoelastic behaviour is evaluated using creep tests, 
relaxation tests, and oscillatory tests (Mezger, 2006) . 
 
2.2.1.1  ROTAT IONAL TESTS AND FLOW  BEHAVIOUR  
In rotational testing, a sample is sheared between two surfaces to simulate laminar flow conditions to 
determine its resistance to flow (Coussot, 2005; Mezger, 2006) . In rotational testing, it is defined the shear 
stress:  
𝜎=𝐹
𝐴𝐸𝑞.2.9 
Where σ is the shear stress (Pa); F is the shear force (kg ∙ms-2); and A is the shear area (m2). 
Similarly, it is defined for the shear rate:  
𝛾̇=𝑑𝑣
𝑑ℎ𝐸𝑞.2.10 
Where γ̇ is the shear rate (s-1); v is the velocity (ms-1) of the fluid in the shear direction; h is the vertical 
distance between the shearing surfaces, perpendicular to the direction of shear. In laminar flow 
conditions, there is a linear velocity distribution across h. Thus, the shear rate is also described a s the 
velocity gradient across the shearing gap.   
38 
 Finally, it can be defined the shear viscosity:  
𝜂=𝜎
𝛾̇𝐸𝑞.2.11 
Where η is the shear viscosity (Pa.s), which is a material constant describing the material’s resistance to 
flow.  
 
2.2.1.1.1 FLOW CURVE  MEAS UREMENTS  
Flow curves present the results from rotational measurements in terms of the shear stress as a function 
of shear rate on the tested material. From the flow curves, shear viscosity can be determined as well as 
Newtonian, or non -Newtonian fluid beha viour (Figure 2.1).

 2.2.1.2  OSCILLATORY TESTS AND  VISCOELASTIC BEHAVI OUR  
In oscillatory tests, a sample is deformed homogeneously between two surfaces back -and-forth, resulting 
in harmonic -periodic motion and the strain and stress are recorded (Mezger, 2006) . 
For ideally elastic materials, samples comply with Hooke’s law, as fo llows:  
𝜎(𝑡)=𝐺∗∙𝛾(𝑡) 𝐸𝑞.2.12 
Where G* is the complex shear modulus (Pa); t is time (s); γ is sample deformation or strain (%). Here, G* 
can be imagined as the material’s resistance to deformation. In oscillatory motion, the σ(t)-curve and γ(t)-
curve can  be described by sine curves and occur simultaneously. That is, the strain response in an ideally 
elastic material occurs immediately at a given stress, or vice -versa, without delay. Therefore, the σ(t) and 
γ(t)-curves are described as being “in phase”.  
For ideally viscous materials, samples comply with Newton’s law, as follows:  
𝜎(𝑡)= 𝜂∗∙𝛾̇(𝑡) 𝐸𝑞.2.13 
Where η* is the complex viscosity (Pa.s), which can be imagined as the viscoelastic flow resistance of the 
sample. In oscillatory motion, there is a delay b etween the σ(t) and γ(t)-curves of 90°. This delay is termed 
the phase -shift angle, δ (°). 
For viscoelastic materials, 0° < δ < 90°, and it can be defined for G*:  
|𝐺∗|=√(𝐺′)2+(𝐺")2𝐸𝑞.2.14 
Where G’ is the storage modulus (Pa) and G” is the loss modulus (Pa) . The G’ is a measure of deformation 
energy stored by the sample during shearing, which is used to reverse the deformation of the sample 
partially or completely; it represents the elastic behaviour of a material. The G” is a measure of the 
unrecoverable de formation energy used by the sample during shearing due to energy loss to frictional 
heating; it represents the viscous behaviour of a material (Mezger, 2006) . It is defined:  
𝐺′=(𝜏𝐴
𝛾𝐴)∙𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛿 𝐸𝑞.2.15 
𝐺"=(𝜏𝐴
𝛾𝐴)∙𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛿 𝐸𝑞.2.16 
Where τA and γA are the amplitude stress (Pa) and amplitude strain (%), respectively.

 2.2.1.2.1 AMPLITUDE SWEEP TEST  
 
 
Figure 2.2 – Amplitude sweep for sludge at 10 rad/s.  
 
The amplitude sweep test is an oscillatory test performed by applying variable amplitudes, while keeping 
the oscillation frequency constant. Results of the amplitude sweep are generally plotted in logarithmic 
scale with G’ or G” against strain, as in Figure 2.2. The amplitude sweep test reveals the structural 
charac ter of a sample. At low strain values, both G’ and G” exhibits constant values. This plateau region is 
termed the linear viscoelastic range (LVE). The limiting value at which the LVE range is exceeded is termed 
the “yield point ” and  is the point at w hich the curve of G’ or G” first deviates the plateau values. This value 
can be pre -defined as the tolerated range at which values are deviated from the plateau value (e.g. 5 – 
10% deviation). Typically, amplitude sweep tests mostly are used to determine t he LVE region of a sample. 
In the LVE region, if G’>G”  then the sample exhibits weak gel structure. If G”>G’, then viscous behaviour 
dominates and samples exhibit character of liquids and tend to flow and show no stability (Mezger, 2006) . 
 
2.2.1.2.2 FREQUE NCY SWEEP TEST

 samples. Short -term behaviour is simu lated by high oscillation frequencies, while long -term behaviour is 
simulated by low frequencies. The frequency sweep must be performed in the LVE region, as determined 
by amplitude sweep tests (Mezger, 2006) . 
 
2.2.2 WASTEWATER SLU DGE  
Sludge refers to the unwanted by -product generated in modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). It 
is a complex material and is notably difficult to characterize (Seyssiecq et al., 2003) , but can be described 
as a suspension of inorganic and organic solid s suspended in a liquid of a variety of dissolved solids. The 
treatment and disposal of sludge often requires over 50% of the operating costs in WWTPs (Spinosa and 
Vesilind, 2001) . Typically, in modern WWTPs sludge originates from primary treatment and sec ondary 
treatment, which are part of the sequence of operations used to treat wastewater. Primary sludge, 
secondary sludge and anaerobically digested sludges are the three main types of sewage sludge.  
In primary treatment, primary sludge is produced as a r esult of removal of settleable solids in the primary 
clarifier or settling tank. Primary sludge contains the solid material separated from the incoming sewage 
to WWTPs. It typically contains large amounts of identifiable solid matter and pathogenic organis ms. 
Following primary treatment, the wastewater undergoes secondary treatment. The activated sludge 
process is the most popular secondary treatment method, where wastewater is mixed with active biomass 
resulting in the reduction of biological oxygen demand , but an excess growth of biomass. This biomass 
must be disposed of, and composes secondary sludge, or waste activated sludge (WAS) (Spinosa and 
Vesilind, 2001) . Secondary sludge contains solids but also microorganisms produced during secondary 
treatment. WAS is significantly different from primary sludge; it is a biological suspension of organic 
particulates and bacteria held together in flocs of gel -like biofil m matrices called extracellular polymeric 
substances (EPS) (Li and Ganczarczyk, 1990; Neyens et al., 2004) . Digested sludge comprises the stabilized 
primary and secondary solids produced in anaerobic fermentation.  
In sludge, but particularly WAS, EPS are l arge molecular weight components which originate  from bacterial 
secretion, cell lysis, exocellular constituents, and organic matter in wastewater (Urbain et al., 1993; 
Wingender et al., 1999) . It is considered that EPS contribute greatly to the s tructural properties and 
flocculation of sludge (Dong et al., 2011) . Furthermore, the hydrophobicity, surface properties and charge 
density are altered by its presence; sludge dewatering is also affected by presence of EPS since they are 
able to entrap lar ge volumes of water (Mikkelsen and Keiding, 2002) . Hence, rheological properties are  
42 
 also affected by EPS concentration in sludge flocs (Mikkelsen and Keiding, 2002; Raszka et al., 2006; Urbain 
et al., 1993) . 
Due to its inherently low biodegradability and dewatering characteristics, WAS is the sludge type 
frequently encountered in TH processes (Barber, 2016; Bougrier et al., 2007; Camacho et al., 2008) . It is 
also often encountered in WAO processes (Strong et al., 2011; Suárez -Iglesias et al., 2017; Urrea e t al., 
2017) .  
 
 2.2.3 GENERAL SLUDG E RHEOLOGY  
Rheological characterisation of sludge is a very useful tool in sludge -handling processes such as 
transportation, stirring, settling, disposal, and mass oxygen transfer; it allows prediction and estimation 
of sludge behaviour during these processes and are used in heat and mass transfer calculations (Bandrés 
et al., 2009) . Generally, sludge can be represented as a water -based suspension containing suspended 
particles, fibrous material and dissolved substances (Baroutian et al., 2013) . Sludge characteristics tend to 
vary depending on wastewater source, treatment process, chemical additives (e.g. polymers) and 
mechanical operations. Hence its fluid behaviour also varies accordingly (Seyssiecq et al., 2003) . 
The rh eological behaviour of only very dilute sludges is Newtonian but  is generally non -Newtonian at 
increasing solids concentration (Dentel, 1997; Sanin, 2002; Spinosa and Vesilind, 2001) . Sludge viscosity is 
affected by its temperature, particle size distribution, extracellular polymeric  substances, and solids 
concentration (Forster, 1982) . Waste activated sludge (WAS) has been identified showing either plastic 
(Dick, 1986; Dick and Ewing, 1967)  or pseudoplastic (Behn, 1962; Moeller and Torres, 1997)  behaviour. 
Wastewater sludges also possess viscoelastic properties (Ayol et al., 2006; Jean Christophe Baudez et al., 
2013) . Due to its non -Newtonian nature, the shear stress of sludge is not linearly proportional to the shear 
rate. This has led to difficulty in its rheological characterisation, since its rheological properties cannot be 
simply related to a single parameter, such as the viscosity (Seyssiecq et al., 2003) . The rheological 
characterisation of sludges have been perfor med using a range of devices and methods, including capillary 
rheometers (Behn, 1962; Slatter, 1997)  and rotational rheometers (Forster, 1982; Lotito et al., 1997; Mori 
et al., 2006)  but there is no conclusive argument for choosing one over the other.  
Slud ge’s rheological properties have been shown to be strongly correlated to structural and surface 
characteristics of bio aggregates  (Li and Yu, 2011) . The colloidal properties of sludge solids Is believed to 
be the primary contributor to its non-Newtonian characteristics (Hiemenz and Rajagopalan, 1997) .  
43 
 Rheological behaviour of colloidal dispersions has been summarized as being dependent on (Shaw, 1992) : 
dispersion medium viscosity, solids concentration, particle size and shape, and inter -particle or particle -
dispersion medium interactions. In terms of WAS, the dispersion medium is considered to be water, a 
Newtonian fluid of constant viscosity. The impact of solids concentration on WAS rheology is well studied 
(Dick and Buck, 1985; Dick and E wing, 1967; Lotito et al., 1997) . On the other hand, the impact of particle 
size and shape is difficult to characterize since WAS has a broad particle size distribution, which also 
changes with time and physical and chemical factors like shear stresses or solution chemistry (Sanin, 2002) . 
The inter -particle and particle -dispersion medium interactions have not been well studied for sludge.  
A wide variety of rheological models have been used to describe sludge rheological behaviour. The power -
law, or Ostwald  model (Eq. 2.17) is frequently encountered (Ayol et al., 2006; Behn, 1962; Lotito et al., 
1997; Valioulis, 1980) , as well as the Bingham model (Eq.2.18) (Frost and Owens, 1982; Khalili Garakani et 
al., 2011; Sozanski et al., 1997) . For thicker sludges, He rschel -Bulkley model (Eq. 2.19) appropriately 
describes flow behaviour at a wide range of shear rates (Baudez et al., 2011)  and is commonly used for 
sludge (Tixier et al., 2003) . The Sisko (Eq. 2.20) and Casson (Eq. 2.21) equations have also been used 
(Bau dez, 2008; Seyssiecq et al., 2003) . 
𝜏=𝐾𝛾̇𝑛𝐸𝑞.2.17 
𝜏=𝜏𝑦+𝐾𝛾̇ 𝐸𝑞.2.18 
𝜏=𝜏𝑦+𝐾𝛾̇𝑛𝐸𝑞.2.19 
𝜏=𝜂∞𝛾̇+𝐾𝛾̇𝑛𝐸𝑞.2.20 
√𝜏=√𝜏𝑦+√𝜂𝛾̇ 𝐸𝑞.2.21 
In the case of non -Newtonian fluids,  the “flow -index”, n < 1 in equations 2.17, 2.19 and 2.20 describes 
shear -thinning behaviour. Equations 2.18, 2.19 and 2.21 incorporate a yield stress value, τy, which must 
be exceeded in order to initiate flow. The existence of a yield stress is generally believed to be due to the 
resistance of solid particles to deformation. In suspensions, the yield stress has also been linked to the 
presence of a three -dimensional interconnected floc network (Hoover et al., 2001) , and corresponds to 
the stress which must be applied to over come Van -Der-Waals forces of cohesion. Generally, the yield 
stress value increases with increasing solid fraction, but decreases as sludge flocs are disrupted under 
shear (Seyssiecq et al., 2003; Spinosa et al., 1989) .  
44 
 Most sludges also exhibit  thixo tropic nature, which relates to its time -dependent behaviour . This is mostly 
related to the tendency of sludges to flocculate. As such, the shearing history of sludge also contributes 
to its rheological response. For example, if the sludge has no t been sheared, the particles are strongly 
flocculated, leading to high viscosity. But if the sludge had been previously pre -sheared, the particles 
become disrupted, which leads to lower viscosity values. In practice, this means during rheological 
measurem ents, the thixotropic characteristics must be considered since introducing sludge samples to 
the rheometer will impose a history of shearing. Therefore, samples are generally submitted to a pre -
shear phase before rheological measurements. This ensures all samples receive the same degree 
rearrangement of their internal structure before characterisation (Seyssiecq et al., 2003) . The power 
required to maintain flow in a flocculant  suspension (Colin, 1970; Michaels and Bolger, 1962)  is used to: 
disrupt  large -scale floc network and overcome yield stress; overcome viscous resistance; and continuously 
disrupt  bonds between groups of particles in aggregates.

 2.2.4 SLUDGE RHEOLOG Y IN THERMAL PROCESS ES 
Despite being an important parameter in the design and operation of hydrothermal processes such as 
Thermal Hydrolysis ( TH), the rheological behaviour of sludge during these processes has not been studied 
in great detail (Barber, 2016) . As shown in Table 2.3, most studies on sludge rheology are focused on non -
thermally treated sludges at ambient to moderate conditions (20 – 70 °C ) and  are related to its application 
in activated sludge processes and anaerobic or aerobic digestion. Mainly, the re is a lack of studies on 
sludge rheology at the elevated temperature and pressure conditions encountered in hydrothermal 
processes. Furthermore, the majority of available studies of rheology in sludge thermal processing have 
been done post -thermal treatment and  is only indicative of the final behaviour of the thermally -treated 
sludge.  
In hydrothermal processing, the primary factors which might influence sludge’s rheological properties are 
the elevated temperature and pressurized  conditions, as well as the change in sludge’s composition due 
to chemical changes and solubilization effects. The influence of temperature has been well studied. For 
example, it has been shown that temperature has a significant influence on sewage sludge viscosity 
(Manoliadis and Bishop, 1984) . The relationship between apparent viscosity and sludge temperature (5 -
30 °C) has been described by the Arrhenius equation; yield stress and Herschel -Bulkley flow index, n, 
increased, while consistency index, k, decr eased with temperature (Hammadi et al., 2012) . On the other 
hand, it has also been shown that the yield stress and Bingham viscosity decreased with temperature (10 
- 60 °C) in digested sludge (Baudez et al., 2013b) . It was suggested that sludge flocs became less dense 
and compact at higher temperature, either due to an increase in the number of voids in the flocs, or due 
to an increase in floc surface area. This causes a modification of sludge structure which was also 
irreversible, and termed ‘thermal history’ (Baudez et al., 2013b) . It has also been pointed out that 
increasing temperatures causes dissolution of organic and inorganic sludge components (Appels et al., 
2010; Paul et al., 2006) . Then, the argument was made that the change of viscosity or y ield stress with 
temperature based on Arrhenius equation would be inaccurate, since the activation energy would change 
as sludge composition changes due to thermal treatment (Baudez et al., 2013b) . The viscoelastic 
properties have  also been shown to be proportional to the decrease in water viscosity due to the effect 
of thermal motion at increasing temperatures (Baudez et al., 2013a) . Table 2.3 also lists some studies 
which related the changes in rheological parameters, like yield stress, to temperature.  The impact of 
pressure on sludge rheology is not studied, however it is considered to be negligible since the pressures  
50 
 encountered are relatively low (<10 bar, in the case of TH); for water, the viscosity would only increase at 
pressures well above 1000 bar (Barnes, 2000) . 
In the case of TH, it has been reported that the resultant effect of hydrolysis was to effectively change 
sludge rheological behaviour such that it behaved as if it were less concentrated. For example, a thermally 
hydrolysed 12 wt% mixe d primary and secondary sludge is comparable to digested sludge at 7 -8 wt % 
(Cumiskey et al., 2003) . The viscosity reduction in thermally -treated sludge has been uniformly observed 
in all studies related to sludge thermal treatment. Verma et al. (2007)  investigated the pre -treatment of 
wastewater sludge (10 – 50 g/L) in thermal (120 °C, 30 min) and thermal alkaline (120 °C, 15 min, pH = 
10.25) treatment and found apparent viscosity decreased by 6 -22% and 13 -42% for thermal and thermal 
alkaline treatment,  respectively. A higher viscosity drop was observed in the higher sludge concentration 
ranges. The apparent viscosity was related to sludge concentration exponentially in both raw and treated 
sludges. Non -Newtonian, Power -law behaviour was observed in the sludges, but thermally treated and 
alkaline thermally treated sludge tended towards Newtonian behaviour. The consistency index, k, 
decreased whereas the flow index, n, increased due to thermal treatment. Table 2.4 presents a number 
of studies related to sl udge thermal treatment in which changes to sludge rheology were presented, but 
not the main focus.  
Only in recent years interest has been increasing for detailed rheological study for sludge thermal 
treatment. Feng et al. (2014)  studied the rheological behaviour in raw and thermally treated (170 °C, 60 
min) WAS (10 – 187 g/L) obtained in a lab -scale reactor. The sludges displayed Herschel -Bulkley flow 
behaviour, thixotropy, and viscoelasticity. As a result of TH, the Herschel -Bulkley parameters k decreased 
significantly while n increased, showing increasingly Newtonian behaviour. These parameters were 
correlated with sludge concentration by exponential relationship, and with temperature by an Arrhenius -
type equation. Storage modul us, G’, decreased by 92.5% after TH. Urrea et al. (2015)  studied WAS (23.3 
g/L TSS) rheology during TH (160 – 200 °C, 0 – 250 min) by sampling sludge at different periods. Initially, 
sludge behaved as a Bingham plastic, but showed Newtonian behaviour at th e end of treatment. The 
temperature -dependence of the treated sludge viscosity was described by an Arrhenius -type equation. 
Zhang et al. (2017)  performed laboratory test for TH at low (60 – 90 °C and high temperature (120 – 180 °C) 
on mechanically dewatere d sludge (14.2 – 18.2 wt%) and attempted to correlate sludge organic 
solubilization with viscoelastic properties. Treated sludge exhibited viscoelastic properties, and G’ was 
linearly correlated to soluble  proteins, polysaccharides and chemical oxy gen demand (COD) in low 
temperature TH, but showed logarithmic relationship for high temperature TH.

 2.3 GAPS OF KNOWLEDG E AND RESEARCH QUEST IONS.  
 
Rheological knowledge of sludge behaviour is paramount to optimization of sludge -handling operations. 
This invariably includes hydrothermal sludge processing units, as a more detailed rheological study can 
help improve operation of the processes (Barber, 2 016)  as well as improve energy balance around the 
entire sludge treatment system (Pérez -Elvira and Fdz -Polanco, 2012) . Although some rheological studies 
have been performed, this literature survey has revealed several gaps still existed and arguments to be  
made with regards to the existing body of knowledge. In particular, most of the rheology studies were 
carried out on sludge only post -treatment, and mostly at ambient conditions. Since the thermal history of 
the sludge significantly impacts its rheology (Farno et al., 2016) , it is based on assumption to relate the 
rheology of post -treated sludge to the true sludge behaviour during hydrothermal processes. Notably, 
most rheology studies available were conducted in context of how it affects the dow nstream  processes 
such as dewatering and anaerobic digestion, rather than how it affects the hydrothermal processing units 
themselves. Only limited number of studies have investigated sludge in the moderate to high 
concentration ranges (5 – 15 wt%) typically enco untered in hydrothermal processing, and studies on 
viscoelasticity of sludge are relatively scarce and recent.  
In that regard, the current study aims to investigate, particularly, the in -situ rheological behaviour of 
sludge in TH processes. Furthermore, t he potential for using the rheological observations as a means to 
indirectly monitor TH performance is also examined by linking rheological properties to compositional 
changes of sludge during thermal treatment process. To achieve this, the following areas  of investigation 
are presented in this thesis:  
• Detailed study of rheological changes of WAS during TH processes using in -situ rheometry 
methods.  
• Detailed study of the compositional changes of WAS during TH using a lab -scale reactor.  
• Correlating rheologica l changes observed to the compositional changes of WAS during TH.  
• Investigation on the impact of sludge concentration on its flow behaviour and viscoelasticity.  
• Developing mathematical models to predict rheological changes of sludge in TH at various TH 
conditions, including temperature, time, and sludge concentration.

 CHAPTER 3:  MATERIAL S AND METHODS  
The experimental work i n this thesis aims to characterize the rheological and physico -chemical changes 
in sewage sludge due to hydrothermal processes, as well as its relationship with processing conditions. To 
this end, various rheological measurements were performed which descr ibed sludge’s flow behaviour and 
viscoelastic properties. These measurements were carried out at varying conditions such that the role of 
process parameters, including treatment temperature, duration and sludge concentration could be 
evaluated. Besides tha t, changes in sludge composition were investigated by examining samples of 
hydrothermally treated sludge obtained from a lab -scale reactor. This was done to establish whether a 
correlation existed between sludge composition and rheological parameters, whic h helped determine 
possible explanations for the changes observed. Data collected from these tests were analysed and 
formed the basis for subsequent results and discussion chapters. This chapter describes the experimental 
methodology and protocols adopted throughout this thesis. Experimental considerations and limitations 
are described, where relevant.  In the subsequent results and discussion chapters, the experimental 
methods which are relevant to the contents of that chapter are also reiterated in summar y.  
3.1 SAMPLE PREPARATI ON 
3.1.1  SLUDGE TYPE  
Waste activated sludge (WAS) has been established as being the most relevant sludge type for undergoing 
thermal hydrolysis (TH) pre -treatment (Bougrier et al., 2007; Pinnekamp, 1989) . This is due to its high 
carbohydrate and protein content, which would benefit from the solubiliza tion effects of TH and lead to 
anaerobic digestion enhancements (Barber, 2016; Wilson and Novak, 2009) . In comparison, other sludge 
types such as primary sludge, which are already inherently easily biodegradable, would not benefit fr om 
TH and would diminish cost -effectiveness if pre -treated (Pérez -Elvira et al., 2008) . Therefore, WAS is the 
focal sludge type for the purposes of this experimental work.  
 
3.1.2  SLUDGE SAMPLIN G 
Samples of WAS were collected from Mount Martha wastewater treatment plant (Mornington Peninsul a, 
Victoria) where sludge is thickened via dissolved air flotation without polymer dosing. Due to its organic 
nature, samples were stored at 4 °C for 30 days upon collection before they were used for experiments.  
71 
 This ensured biological activity was stabil ized during experiments which helped to minimize variations in 
the sludge composition and maintain sample consistency between experiments (Baudez et al., 2011; 
Curvers et al., 2009) . 
 
3.1.2.1  SLUDGE THICKENING  
Sludge samples had initial total solids (TS) concentration of 3.5 wt% upon collection. These were thickened 
to achieve higher TS values required for experiments. Initially, sludge was thickened via vacuum filtration, 
as this was believed to impose minimal sample stresses. However, this was found to be impractical and 
rarely achieved TS values greater than 9 wt%. As  such, sludge samples were thickened via centrifugation 
as follows:  
1. 3.5 wt% WAS samples were inserted into polypropylene centrifuge bottles.  
2. Centrifuge temperature was configured to maintain a constant temperature at 4 °C during 
centrifugation. This was ac hieved via the environment control system built into the centrifuge.  
3. Bottled samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm (13,700 G) for 20 minutes.  
4. Centrate was collected from centrifuged sludge and stored.  
5. Thickened sludge was then centrifuged again at 9000 rpm (13,700 G) for 20 minutes.  
6. Steps 4 – 5 were repeated such that the centrifugation time of sludge totalled 2 hours.  
7. Thickened sludge (Figure 3.1) and collected centrate (sludge liquor) were stored separately at 4 °C.  
Then, the centrifuge -thickened sludge w as diluted using the collected sludge liquor or the original, 
unthickened sludge (3.5 wt%) to achieve a range of sludge concentrations (7 – 13 wt%). The TS of sludge 
was determined as described in 3.2.1.1.  
 
3.1.2.1.1 EFFECT OF CENTRIFUGATION ON SL UDGE SOLU BILIZATION  
Since centrifugation thickening of the sludge was necessary to achieve the required sludge concentrations 
in this work, it was investigated whether the high stresses involved affected the sludge characteristics. 
Primarily, the quantity of organi c content (measured as soluble chemical oxygen demand, sCOD) in the 
soluble phase of the sludge was compared between different centrifugation parameters and non -
centrifuged sludge. These were:   
72 
 1) 2 – step filtration: whereby 3% sludge was filtered firstly thr ough a 6 μm filter followed by 
filtration through a 0.45  μm filter to obtain sludge liquor.  
2) Centrifugation at 4400 rpm (2300 G) for 20 minutes to obtain sludge liquor.  
3) Centrifugation at 6000 rpm (4340 G) for 20 minutes to obtain sludge liquor.  
4) Centrifugati on at 10, 000 rpm (12,100 G) for 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes to 
obtain sludge liquor.  
 
 
Figure 3. 1 – Polypropylene centrifuge bottles used to thicken waste activated sludge via centrifuge, 
showing thickened  sludge separated from sludge liquor.  
 
The sludge liquor obtained were analysed for sCOD as described in 3.2.2.2. It was observed (Figure 3.2) 
that centrifugation did not significantly affect the sCOD content in the sludge liquor. In most cases, sCOD 
in the centrifuged sludge was very similar t o the non -centrifuged sludge. Variation in the sCOD values 
between the centrifuged and non -centrifuged sludge are also consistent with inherent errors arising from 
the COD method and variations in sample characteristics. The results indicate the centrifugi ng stresses 
 
73 
 are not significant to cause rupture of cells (therefore change in soluble organic content). Besides that, all 
samples used for this study were centrifuged equally during sludge preparation; so, any changes due to 
centrifugation effects would  be equally present in all samples used for this study.

activated sludge compared to non -centrifuged sludge (2 -step filtration).  
 
3.2 SLUDGE CHARACTER IZATION  
3.2.1 SLUDGE SOLIDS CHARACTERIZATION  
The solids content of sludge was characterized based on procedures established in Standard Methods 
(APHA, 1992)  for total solids (TS, wt%), volatile solids (VS, wt%), total suspended solids (TSS, wt%), and 
volatile suspended solids (VS S, wt%).  
 
3.2.1.1  TOTAL SOLIDS CONCENTR ATION  
The TS content was determined gravimetrically for all sludge samples as follows:  
1. Ceramic evaporating dishes were cleaned and ignited at 550 °C for at least 1 hour, and the mass 
of the dish was weighed after cool ing in a sealed desiccator.  
2. Sludge samples were mixed at 500 rpm using a mechanical mixer for 5 minutes.  
3. Samples of wet sludge were transferred onto dishes and weighed.  0100020003000400050006000700080009000sCOD (mg/L)2-step filtration

 4. Wet sludge samples were placed into a drying oven at 105 °C for 24 hours or until const ant mass 
is attained.  
5. The dried sample was weighed, and TS was calculated as follows:  
𝑇𝑆 (%)= (𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒−𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑠ℎ)
(𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑡 𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒−𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑠ℎ)∗100 
 
3.2.1.2  VOLATILE SOLIDS CONCE NTRATION  
The VS content of sludge was determined using dried sludge samples produced during TS measurement, 
as follows:  
1. Dried sludge samples were weighed as in step 5 of 3.2.1.1.  
2. Dried sludge samples were placed inside a furnace and ignited at 550 °C for 2 hours.  
3. Ignited samples were removed from furnace and placed in a desiccator to cool to room 
temperature.  
4. Ignited sample residue was weighed, and VS calculated as:  
 
𝑉𝑆 (%)= (𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒−𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒 𝑎𝑠ℎ)
(𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒)∗100 
 
3.2.1.3  TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLID S CONCENTRATION  
Due to the highly concentrated nature of the sludge used in this study, samples must be diluted in order 
to determine its TSS content. The TSS content was determined as follows:  
1. A small sheet of plastic film was placed on an analytical balance which was then zeroed.  
2. A pea -sized amount of thickened sludge sample was transferred onto the plastic sheet using a 
spatula and weighed.  
3. The weighed sludge sample was transferred together with the p lastic sheet into a beaker 
containing a pre -determined volume of deionized water. The volume of water was determined 
such that the sludge sample would be effectively diluted up to a factor of 20 once mixed. The 
density of sludge was previously determined t o be comparable to the density of water at room 
temperature with negligible variation.   
75 
 4. A magnetic stirrer was used to mix the sludge and deionized water until uniform. The plastic film 
sheet was removed, ensuring no sludge residue remained on the sheet.  
5. Borosilicate glass fibre filters (1.5 μm pore size), which were factory prewashed and weighed 
according to Standard Methods  (ProWeigh Filters, Environmental Express), were placed onto a 
vacuum filter apparatus and wetted with deionized water.  
6. Diluted s ludge samples were completely filtered through filter apparatus via vacuum, washing 3 
times with 10 mL deionized water.  
7. Filter paper was carefully removed after all traces of water were removed by suction and placed 
in an oven to dry at 105 °C for 24 hours . 
8. Dried samples were cooled in a desiccator then quickly weighed using an analytical balance.  
9. TSS was calculated as:  
 
𝑇𝑆𝑆 (%)= (𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟−𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟)
(𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒)∗100 
 
3.2.1.4  VOLATILE SUSPENDED SO LIDS CONCENTRATION  
The VSS content was determined using the dried samples produced during TSS measurement, as follows:  
1. Dried sludge samples were weighed as in step 8 of 3.2.1.3.  
2. Dried sample on glass filter paper was transferred onto ceramic dishes and ignited in a furnace at 
550 °C for 2 hours.  
3. Samples were removed from furnace and placed into desiccator to cool to room temperature.  
4. Ignited samples were weighed on glass filter papers using an analytical balance.  
5. VSS was calculated as:  
 
𝑉𝑆𝑆 (%)= (𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒−𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒)
(𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒)∗100 
 
3.2.2 SLUDGE COMPOSI TION CHARACTERIZATIO N 
Changes in sludge composition due to hydrothermal processing  must be determined in order to establish 
whether these changes are related to the sludge rheology. However, sludge is a complex heterogeneous  
76 
 biological suspension composed of various organic compounds, including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, 
as well a s other materials such as lignin and fibres (Li and Noike, 1992; Toor et al., 2011) . This makes 
quantifying compositional changes based on any specific sludge component particular ly challenging since 
the characteristics of sludge in the real world tend to vary greatly, depending on factors such as sample 
origin and time of collection. Therefore, the investigated parameters must be quantifiable and consistent 
between samples, as wel l as being  representative of the changes occurring due to hydrothermal 
treatment. As revealed in the literature review for hydrothermal processes (Chapter 2), sludge organics 
undergo solubilization during treatment. Furthermore, in the range of experimenta l temperatures 
investigated (no more than 150 °C), sludge solids undergo thermal decomposition without occurrence of 
oxidation (i.e. thermal hydrolysis). Thus, the primary performance indicator to be considered, within the 
scope of this study, is the exten t of organic matter solubilization. Chemical parameters which are 
commonly used to reflect the soluble organic content of sludge include: soluble chemical oxygen demand 
(sCOD), soluble proteins, and soluble polysaccharides. There is currently no generalize d method for 
evaluating the performance of thermal hydrolysis (TH) processes but chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 
sCOD are very frequently reported in literature (Pilli et al., 2015) . COD is defined as the amount of a 
specified oxidant that reacts with a sample under con trolled conditions (APHA, 1992) . In the case of WAS, 
it pro vides a measure of its organic content. Since COD does not distinguish between organic compounds, 
it provides a very practical method for quantifying the solubilization of sludge organics, regardless of 
variations in sludge composition. For these reasons, the charac terization of sludge composition in this 
thesis was based around COD measurement. The methods of characterization are described in the 
following section.  
 
3.2.2.1  TOTAL CHEMICAL OXYGEN  DEMAND  
Measurements of COD were carried out using commercial COD test kits from HACH Pacific (High Range 
Plus; Method 8000; using DR 5000 Spectrophotometer and DRB200 Single Block Reactor). Since sludge 
can be categorized into two phases: particulate and soluble phases, the total COD (tCOD) measurement 
describes the  sum of organic content present in both phases of the sludge.  Total COD measurement was 
performed as follows:  
1) A sludge sample of known mass was diluted up to 20 times by mixing with deionized water using 
a magnetic stirrer.   
77 
 2) 0.2 mL sample of diluted sludg e was pipetted into vials containing COD digestion reagent and 
gently shaken to mix.  
3) 0.2 mL of deionized water was also pipetted into a vial containing COD digestion reagent to 
produce a blank.  
4) The vials were placed into the reactor (DRB200) preheated to 1 50 °C and heated for 2 hours.  
5) Vials were cooled in the reactor until 120 °C and removed to cool in a cooling rack to room 
temperature.  
6) Spectrophotometer program for COD measurement was started and the blank COD vial was 
inserted to zero the spectrophotomet er.  
7) Vials containing reacted sludge samples were placed into spectrophotometer and the COD value 
(mg/L) was recorded.  
8) COD values were multiplied by their respective dilution factors to obtain true values.  
9) COD measurement was performed in triplicate per sample in separate reagent vials and values 
averaged.  
 
3.2.2.2  SOLUBLE CHEMICAL OXYG EN DEMAND  
Measurement of the soluble COD was performed on the sludge liquor to determine the organic content 
of sludge which has been solubilized. Here, the soluble phase of sludge is defined as the sludge which 
passes a 0.45 μm filter. The sCOD measurements were performed as follows:  
1) Sludge samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm (12,100 G).  
2) Then, the centrate (sludge liquor; Figure 3.3) was fi ltered through a mixed cellulose ester 
membrane (0.45 μm pore size) via vacuum.  
3) The filtered liquor was collected (Figure 3.4) and diluted up to 40 times by mixing with deionized 
water using a magnetic stirrer.  
4) COD of the diluted filtered liquor was deter mined as steps 2 – 9 in 3.1.4.1.

 3.3 SLUDGE THERMAL H YDROLYSIS  
3.3.1 THERMAL HYDROL YSIS REACTOR  
Sludge thermal hydrolysis (TH) was performed in a lab-scale reactor in order to obtain samples for 
solubilisation characterization. The reactor used was a 100 mL stainless steel pressure vessel (Parr 4791 
series, split ring -type) with a detachable head (Figure 3.5). The detachable head, which is used to s eal the 
vessel, is equipped with four separate openings for connecting a sampling valve, a safety rupture disc, a 
pressure gauge, and a thermocouple. Once assembled, a flouroelastomeric gasket provides an airtight 
seal. The pressure vessel has maximum oper ating temperature of 250 °C and maximum operating 
pressure of 207 bar. A sampling tube is attached to the sampling valve connector on the inner side of the 
vessel to allow real -time sampling of sludge. Heating was provided via a heating jacket (Hotco Rollb and 
series). A temperature controller regulates heating via a thermocouple attached to the outer surface of 
the vessel. A separate thermocouple was connected on the inside of the vessel to monitor sample 
temperature. During operation, a syringe pump was us ed to pressurize the vessel using nitrogen gas. A 
diagrammatic representation of the reactor setup during operation is illustrated in Figure 3.6.  
 
3.3.2 THERMAL HYDROL YSIS R EACTION  
Thermal hydrolysis of sludge was carried out under conditions simulating t hose used in full -scale 
processes. Sludge was heated to the desired treatment temperature and held constant for 60 minutes 
under pressurized nitrogen environment. Nitrogen prevents oxidation of sludge contents and 
pressurization ensured that sludge remaine d in the liquid phase. During the 60 -minute treatment period, 
samples of sludge were obtained periodically to be used for COD characterization. The TH reactions were 
carried out as follows:  
1) Thickened sludge samples were mixed using a mechanical mixer for 5  minutes at 500 rpm.  
2) 90 mL of sludge was introduced into the reactor via the sampling tube using a syringe. The syringe 
was modified to allow a secure attachment to the sample inlet valve of the reactor (Figure 3.7). 
This allowed the sludge to fill reactor  from the bottom of the vessel. This prevents any air bubbles 
being trapped within the sludge, especially for thickened sludge.  
3) The reactor was sealed by securing the vessel head to the body, during which the sample 
thermocouple and sampling tube were subm erged into the sludge. The thermocouple was 
positioned such that it was only in contact with the sludge and located near the sampling tube.   
81 
 4) The syringe pump was filled with nitrogen gas using a nitrogen gas bottle and then connected to 
the sealed reactor.  
5) Air was purged from the reactor by pressurization and venting cycles.  
6) The reactor was pressurized to 5 bar pressure using nitrogen gas, which was maintained by the 
syringe pump.  
7) The heating jacket was attached to the pressure vessel and the vessel was heat ed to 25 °C. The 
sample was allowed to equilibrate for 5 minutes once it reached 25 °C.  
8) Then, the reactor temperature was raised to the set point temperature (80 – 145 °C) using the 
temperature controller. A stopwatch was used to record the amount of time required for the 
sample to reach set point temperature.  
9) 5 mL sludge samples were collected periodically during the heat up period by opening the 
sampling valve and collecting sludge samples in sealable containers. Once collected, the sample 
containers wer e immediately submerged into an ice bath to rapidly cool. Cooled samples were 
immediately placed in 4 °C refrigerator. The syringe pump automatically adjusts to maintain 
constant 5 bar pressure in the reactor.  
10) Once sample temperature reached set point temp erature, the temperature was held constant for 
60 minutes.  
11) During the 60 -minute treatment period, 5 mL sludge samples were collected periodically, as in 
step 9.  
12) Sludge characterization (tCOD, sCOD, TS, TSS, VS, and VSS) was carried out on collected samples 
as per Section 3.2.  
3.4 SLUDGE RHEOLOGIC AL CHARACTERIZATION  
Rheological testing comprised most of the experimental work carried out in this thesis. Measurements 
were made primarily to characterize sludge’s flow behaviour and viscoelastic  characteristics. Particularly, 
the characterization of sludge’s rheological properties in situ during hydrothermal processing was of 
interest since this had not been done in any published literature. In -situ rheological measurement of 
hydrothermally proce ssed sludge traditionally posed many practical challenges largely due to the elevated 
temperature and pressurized conditions of the processes. However, the recent availability of commercial 
accessories which allow rheological measurements at pressurized en vironments has made some of these  
82 
 measurements possible. The following sections describe the developmental process of the rheometric 
techniques, and the protocols eventually adopted in this experimental work.  
 
3.4.1 RHEOMETER  
All rheological tests in this thesis were performed on a controlled -stress rheometer (HR -3, TA Instruments; 
Figure 3.8). The rheometer is equipped with a variety of geometries, including: concentric cylinder 
geometry adhering to DIN  53019 specifications (inner diameter: 28 mm, outer d iameter: 30.4 mm, length: 
42 mm), vane geometry with serrated cup (inner diameter: 29 mm, outer diameter: 32 mm, length 44 
mm), and parallel plate geometry (40 mm diameter). In the case of the concentric cylinder and vane 
geometries, sample temperature was  controlled using a water jacket utilizing Peltier elements for heating 
and circulating water for cooling. For the parallel plate geometries, heating and cooling are achieved 
through the bottom plate via Peltier elements and circulating water. The rheomete r was also equipped 
with a pressure cell accessory to enable measurement of samples under pressurized conditions.  
 
3.4.1.1  RHEOMETER PRESSURE CE LL 
The pressure cell was used when performing rheological measurements at high temperature and 
pressurized condi tions to simulate conditions encountered in hydrothermal processing. It was capable of 
operating at maximum temperature 150 °C, and heating was supplied by a water -cooled Peltier jacket. 
The pressure cell is made up of the pressure cell cup, the rotor asse mbly, and the magnet assembly, 
illustrated in (Figure 3.9). In operation, the pressure cell performs as a concentric cylinder geometry, with 
rotor (26 mm diameter, 44 mm length) and cup (28 mm diameter). Due to the enclosed nature of the 
pressure cell, the  rotor (bob) is not physically connected to the rheometer. Rather, connection was 
achieved via magnetic coupling. During operation, pressurization was achieved using a syringe pump.   
83

loaded into reactor from the bottom of the vessel.

temperature and high -pressure conditions.

3.4.1.1.1 PRESSURE C ELL ERROR MINIMIZATI ON 
It was observed during preliminary testing that the pressure cell frequently produced unreliable results. 
This was often the case when measurements were performed at high temperatures. For example, flow 
curves measured at high temperatures may produce a lo t of noise in the data or be evidently inconsistent 
(Figure 3.10). It was suspected that these errors are primarily due to the pressure cell, since they were 
not present when using the concentric cylinder geometries at lower temperatures (<80 °C). One poss ible 
source of error was from the magnetic coupling between the rotor and the rheometer (Figure 3.9). Since 
the rotor is not physically connected to the rheometer, there were likely flaws in the transmission of 
shearing forces from the rotor to the rheomet er sensors. More importantly, the magnets used to achieve 
the coupling are of relatively high mass. This adds to the inertia of the rotor and makes measurement at 
low shear rates prone to error. Another source of error was friction between the rotor shaft and the 
bearings used to keep the rotor in alignment. Notably, it was observed at the end of experiments droplets 
of water would sometimes collect around the bearings (Figure 3.11) – likely due to condensation. Also, 
the bearings would sometimes show stain s of sludge samples likely resulting from the sludge being 
 
85 
 splashed during measurement. To overcome these errors, certain steps and precautions were adopted 
during the loading of sample and pre -preparations:  
1) Prior to assembling the pressure cell, the compo nents which make up the rotor assembly were 
thoroughly cleaned and dried. The bearings were cleaned under soapy water using a pipe brush 
and the rotor shaft was cleaned by wiping with alcohol. After cleaning, the rotor assembly 
components were dried in an oven at 105 °C for at least 10 minutes. This helped to ensure minimal 
friction arising from the bearings.  
2) Exactly 10 mL of sample was loaded during each measurement. Samples were injected using a 
syringe directly into the unsealed pressure cell cup from th e bottom of the cup to ensure no gas 
bubbles are entrapped in the samples. This ensures the pressure cell is correctly filled every time 
and avoids sample splashes due to over -filling.  
3) After sample loading, the pressure cell was sealed carefully without ro tating the rotor, ensuring 
no sample overflow. Once sealed, the rotor was operated to shear the sample for 5 minutes at 
shear rate 10 s-1. This ensured the sample was properly distributed in the measuring gap.  
4) Once sealed, the thumbscrew at the top of the rotor assembly (Figure 3.9) was removed. Then, 
the pressure cell was connected to a nitrogen gas -filled syringe pump and the inlet valve was 
opened to allow pressurized nitrogen gas to enter the pressure cell and exit from the opened 
thumbscrew. This was d one to effectively “flush” the bearings and remove any excess moisture.  
5) Finally, the thumbscrew is reassembled, and the pressure cell is sealed properly. Measurements 
protocols were then commenced normally.  
The above steps were applied each time during mea surements using the pressure cell, regardless of test -
type and conditions.  
 
3.4.2 IN -SITU RHEOME TRIC METHODS  
As previously highlighted, one of the major goals of this experimental work was the in -situ measurement 
of sludge rheological properties during hyd rothermal treatment. The objective was to obtain a real -time 
depiction of the rheological changes occurring due to hydrothermal treatment. In hydrothermal processes, 
solubilization of sludge is accomplished by holding the sludge at a fixed temperature over  time. One way 
to measure these changes was by producing flow curves at constant temperature over time. Flow curve 
generation was the most practical solution since it described the general rheological behaviour and  
86 
 provides useful parameters such as yield stress and viscosity. Described below are the considerations and 
development of the in -situ rheometric methods adopted in this thesis.

 3.4.2.1  CONSTANT SHEAR RATE P EAK HOLD METHOD  
One of the challenges considered during development of the test protocol was the time -dependent nature 
of the sludge undergoing thermal treatment – sludge is solubilized irreversibly as thermal treatment 
proceeds. As in -situ measurement had not been done before, it was unknown whether sludge rheological 
changes would occur instantaneou sly upon reaching treatment temperatures, or whether they proceeded 
slowly overtime. In case of the latter, the rate of rheological changes was also uncertain. It has been shown 
that the solubilization of sludge at high temperature is a time -dependent proc ess (Everett, 1972; 
Imbierowicz and Chacuk, 2012) , so the sludge may not be at an equilibrium state during measurement. 
That is, the time taken for measuring each data point must be considered so they accoun t for the 
irreversible changes of the sludge during the time taken to measure each data point.  
An initial solution proposed for overcoming this was to obtain a continuous curve of shear stress data over 
time, at a constant shear rate. Then, the shear rate  would be varied, and the test repeated on a new 
sample. This way, the flow curve would be generated manually using shear stress data obtained at various 
shear rates. One advantage to this was that since the shear stress data was obtained continuously, it is 
theoretically possible to generate a flow curve for any point in time during thermal treatment. This way, 
any significant changes occurring within a small timeframe  would be observable. The method for the peak 
hold method at constant shear rat e was as follows:  
1) Without sample, the pressure cell was heated to set point temperature (80 °C) and a constant 
shear rate was applied (100 s-1) for 5 minutes. The average torque ( μN.m) was divided by the 
average velocity (rad/s) to obtain the friction correction factor. This value was used to correct the 
raw data for friction of the pressure cell.  
2) After sample loading, pressure cell was sealed, and air was removed by pressurization and venting 
cycles using nitrogen gas at 5 bar pressure applied  via syringe pump. Then sludge was pressurized 
to 5 bar with nitrogen gas.  
3) Sludge was heated to set point temperature (80 °C).  
4) Once set point temperature was reached, a constant shear rate was applied to sludge (100 s-1). 
5) Shear stress was recorded continuo usly, with sampling interval of 1 data point per second over 
60 minutes.  
6) Sample was removed, and the test is repeated using a new sample, varying set point temperature 
(80 – 145 °C) and shear rate (100 – 600 s-1).  
88 
 However, it was found that the flow curves  manually produced this way would not give consistent or 
reliable results (Figure 3.12). This was most likely because the measurement for each shear rate was 
obtained from separate samples, which contain variations unavoidable between each sample. On the 
other hand, a great number of shear stress data points would be required to produce a more complete 
flow curve. This was impractical to carry out within the scope of this thesis, so another method was 
considered.

treatment times, generated manually via constant shear rate peak hold method.  
 
3.4.2.2  IN-SITU FLOW CURVE GENE RATION METHOD  
From the peak hold data generated previously,  it was observed that the apparent viscosity of sludge 
(Figure 3.13) decreased rapidly initially but gradually plateaued over time. This indicated, the rate of 
rheological changes would be high during the initial 10 – 15 minutes of treatment but negligible  at longer 
treatment times. Then, if a complete flow curves could be generated within a short time period, this may 
limit the errors arising from measuring the transient properties of sludge. As such, it was decided to 
generate flow curves periodically whi le the sludge was held at constant temperature over time. The 
method was carried out as follows:  
1) Sample was loaded, as described in 3.4.1.1.1.  020406080100120140160

 2) Air was purged from the pressure cell by pressurization and venting cycles using nitrogen gas at 5 
bar pressure applied via syringe pump. Then sludge was pressurized to 5 bar with nitrogen gas.  
3) Sludge was heated to 25 °C and equilibrated for 5 minutes.  
4) Sludge was pre -sheared at shear rate 675 s-1 (maximum shear rate producible on the pressure cell) 
for 20 m inutes to erase sample shear history. Then the sludge was equilibrated at zero shear for 
2 minutes.  
5) Flow curve was generated at 25 °C via a logarithmic sweep of decreasing shear rates (600 – 0.1s1). 
Time taken to produce the complete flow curve averaged ar ound 120 s for 10 data points per 
decade. This produced the flow curve describing the untreated sludge.  
6) Sludge was heated to the set point temperature (80 °C), heating times averaged 10 – 15 minutes.  
7) Once set point temperature was reached, sludge was pre -sheared at 675 s-1 for 2 minutes 
followed by 1 minute of equilibration at rest.  
8) Sludge was held at set point temperature for 60 minutes.  
9) Periodically, flow curves were generated during the constant temperature period. Flow curves 
were generated via logarith mic sweep of decreasing shear rates (600 – 0.1 s-1). Prior to each flow 
curve measurement, intermediate pre -shearing was applied (675 s-1 shear rate for 2 minutes 
followed by 1 -minute equilibration).  
10) After 60 minutes at constant set point temperature, slud ge was cooled down to 25 °C. Flow curve 
was generated as in step 9 to characterize the rheology for thermally treated sludge.  
11) Measurements were repeated varying treatment temperature and sludge concentration.  
This method was found to be much more reliable for producing consistent results. As such, this method 
was adopted for in -situ rheometric measurements performed in this thesis.

3.4.2.3  SLIPPAGE EFFECTS  
It was observed that flow curves generated in the concentric cylinder geometries when measuring sludge 
produced a secondary curve trend at low shear rates (Figure 3.14). This was true for all concentrations of 
sludge measured and at all temperatures consid ered. It was suspected that this was a result of slippage 
effects at low shear rate values. This phenomenon was investigated by comparing flow curves produced 
using the regular concentric cylinder geometries versus flow curves generated using the concentri c 
cylinders with sandpaper attached. The concentric cylinder with sandpaper  attached can be seen in Figure 
3.15 and was produced by attaching strips of sandpaper  (400 grit) laterally along the rotor bob. This 
reduces likelihood of slipp age along the rotor surface. As shown in Figure 3.14, attaching the flow curve 
generated using the sandpaper -attached rotor produced a distinctly continuous curve trend, which is 
comparable to other shear -thinning materials. Since it was impractical to ach ieve a reliable roughened 
surface in the pressure cell, the low shear rate data produced during flow curve generation were 
disregarded and assumed to be erroneous. Only the high shear rate data were considered for analysis.

 3.4.3 VISCOELASTIC C HARACTERIZATION  
The viscoelastic properties were measured to characterize the solid -like properties of sludge. However, 
in-situ m easurements requiring the use of the pressure cell were not possible. This was due to the 
incapability of the pressure cell to produce useful results from oscillatory measurements. Since 
viscoelastic measurements required the rotor to oscillate at high fre quencies, the high inertia of the rotor 
would produce noisy data. For example, the strain sweep results for sludge measured in the pressure cell 
produced illegible curve trends (Figure 3.16). As such, viscoelastic characterization was performed using 
tradi tional geometries at ambient conditions.  
 
Figure 3. 16 – Strain sweep results obtained from measuring 11 wt% waste activated sludge using the 
pressure cell geometry, showing erroneous results.  
  
 
93 
 3.4.3.1 Viscoelastic measurement  geometries  
The suitability of geometries chosen to perform viscoelastic measurements were taken into consideration, 
since measurement of sludge posed some practical challenges.  
 
3.4.3.3.1 CONCENTRIC  CYLINDER GEOMETRY  
Concentric cylinder geometry was initi ally considered for performing the viscoelastic tests for sludge. The 
main advantage was consistency of geometry with the in -situ tests performed in the pressure cell, which 
also operated as concentric cylinder geometries. However, since it exhibited slipp age effects for sludge at 
low shear rates (as described in 3.4.2.3), this prevented oscillatory tests performed at low frequency 
ranges. Slippage on the concentric cylinder geometry could not be reliably prevented in a consistent 
manner. Hence oscillatory test data obtained using concentric cylinder geometry were not considered for 
further analysis.  
 
3.4.3.3.2 VANE GEOME TRY 
Vane geometry was considered as it avoids the issues of slippage encountered in concentric cylinders, but 
fundamentally operates on an equivalent basis as the concentric cylinders (Mezger, 2006) . The vane 
geometry consists of four spindles arranged perpendicularly to each other and aligned along the length 
of the rotor (effective rotor diameter 28 mm, length 42  mm, cup  diameter 30.4 mm). However, it was 
observed that the vane geometry fails when measuring sludge at increasingly higher sludge 
concentrations. For example, at 12 wt% solids concentration, the sludge could not be distributed evenly 
into the rheometer cup due  to its thickness. As the vane rotor rotates, much of the sludge would cling 
onto the rotor and a gap effectively forms between the rotor and the shearing surface – hence, no 
effective shearing occurred (Figure 3.17). Oscillatory test data obtained from va ne geometry were not 
considered for further analysis.  
 
3.4.3.3.2 CONE AND P LATE GEOMETRY  
The cone and plate geometry was initially considered as it provides a constant shear rate within the entire 
shearing gap (Mezger, 2006) . The geomet ry consists of a conical upper rotor (60 mm diameter, 2 ° cone 
angle, 53 μm truncation gap) and flat bottom plate. However, slippage still existed since the plate surfaces  
94 
 were smooth. More significantly, the geometry was unsuitable for sludge as it is inc apable of 
accommodating for larger particle sizes due to the small truncation gap.  
 
3.4.3.3.3 Parallel plate geometry  
The parallel plate geometry consists of a rotating flat upper plate (40 mm diameter) and a static, flat lower 
plate. It avoids the particle size limitations of the cone and plate geometry and slippage effects can be 
easily overcome. However, one drawback is the shear rate imposed on a sample varies along the radius 
of the plate. Then, the recorded shear rate is only a representative v alue. However, it was the most reliable 
geometry for producing consistent results required within the scope of this study. Slippage effects were 
eliminated by attaching sandpaper (400 grit) to the measuring surfaces. Thus, parallel plate geometry was 
chose n for performing viscoelastic tests.

the thickened sludge did not shear properly due to formation of gap between the rotor and the shearing 
surface of the cup.  
 
95 
 3.4.3.2  AMPLITUDE SWEEP TESTS  
Amplitude sweep tests were performed to determine the linear viscoelastic region (LVE) of the sludge and 
its gel -like characteristics, as follows:  
1) Sludge samples were loaded onto the lower plate and heated to 25 °C to equilibrate at rest for 5 
minutes.  
2) Upper plate was lowered into the sample such that the measuring gap was 1 mm. Sample overfill 
was not removed.  
3) Sample was pre -sheared at 1000 s-1 for 5 minutes followed by 2 minutes equilibration at rest. 
While the sample was rested, the sample overflow was carefully trimmed and removed. Trimming 
the excess sample at this stage prevented edge effects during pre -shearing of the sludge, which 
tended to occur at higher sludge concentrations.  
4) Logarithmic sweep of strain from 0.01 – 100 % at 20 points per decade was performed at constant 
angular frequency of 10 rad/s.  
 
3.4.3.3  FREQUENCY SWEEP TESTS  
Frequency sweep tests were performed to determine the ti me-dependent characteristics of the sludge 
and its gel -like characteristics, as follows:  
1) Steps 1 – 3 of 3.4.3.2 was performed.  
2) Logarithmic sweep of angular frequency from 1 – 100 rad/s at 10 points per decade was 
performed at constant strain of 0.1 %.  
 
3.4.3.4  CREEP TESTS  
The creeping behaviour of the sludge was evaluated by creep tests as follows:  
1) Steps 1 – 3 of 3.4.3.2 was performed.  
2) Step stress was imposed on the sludge for 180 s and the strain response was recorded over time. 
Stress values imposed on  the sludge was dependent on sludge type and determined based on the 
LVE region of the sludge from amplitude sweep results. The step stress was imposed as a raw 
torque value on the rheometer.  
  
96 
 3.4.3.5  YIELD STRESS DETERMIN ATION  
Yield stress was determined directly for sludge samples using the parallel plate geometry by performing 
a stress ramp, as follows:  
1) Steps 1 – 3 of 3.4.3.2 was performed.  
2) A linear ramp of torque was applied for 60 s. The range of torque values was determined using 
amplitude sweep resul ts and chosen as the range of equivalent stress values 1 – 2 decades above 
and below the transition from LVE region of the sludge.  
3) Yield stress was determined by “tangent crossover method” by plotting stress/deformation in 
logarithmic scale and fitting two  straight lines on the two curve intervals (Figure 3.18) that result 
from the data (Mezger, 2006) .

 4.1 ABSTRACT  
Hydrothermal processing plays a significant role in sewage sludge treatment. However, the rheological 
behaviour of sludge during these processes is not fully understood. A better understanding of the sludge  
rheology under hydrothermal processing conditions can help improve process efficiency. Moreover, 
sludge rheology is easier to measure than chemical analyses. If a relationship could be established, it 
provides a possibility of using rheological measuremen t as a basis for monitoring the performance of 
hydrothermal processing. The rheological changes in thickened waste activated sludge (7 wt%) was 
investigated using a pressure cell -equipped rheometer during 60 -min thermal hydrolysis (TH) at various 
temperatu res (80 -145 °C) and constant pressure (5 bar). Changes in the soluble chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) were measured using a separate reactor with a similar operating condition. The sludge behaved as 
a shear -thinning fluid and could be described by the Hersche l-Bulkley model. At constant temperature, 
the yield stress and high -shear (600 s-1) viscosity of sludge decreased logarithmically over 60 min. At 
constant time, the yield stress and the high -shear viscosity decreased linearly with increasing TH 
temperature  and these values was much less than corresponding properties after treatment and cooling 
down to 25 °C. The soluble COD of sludge also increased logarithmically over 60 min at constant 
temperature and increased linearly with increasing temperature at cons tant time. Furthermore, the yield 
stress and high -shear viscosity reduction showed a linear correlation with the increase in soluble COD.  
 
4.2 INTRODUCTION  
Implementing hydrothermal processing technologies such as thermal hydrolysis (TH) in sewage sludge 
treatment has become increasingly popular. The elevated temperature conditions (above 100 °C) used in 
this process improves sludge treatment outcomes; howeve r, the rheology of sludge under these 
conditions is not fully understood even though it plays a key role in optimizing these processes (Barber, 
2016). Therefore, a better understanding on the rheological behaviour of sludge during hydrothermal 
processing c an help improve its design and operation. Furthermore, the performance indicators in 
hydrothermal processing, such as sludge solubilisation, cannot be easily measured during operation, 
whereas in -situ rheological measurements are potentially easier to perf orm (Konigsberg et al., 2013). As 
such, the rheology of sludge could potentially be useful in describing the performance of hydrothermal 
processing operations if a relationship between rheological properties and reaction performance 
indicators (e.g. COD) c ould be established.     
100 
 Thermal hydrolysis is among the more popular hydrothermal processing technologies used in sewage 
sludge treatment today (Hii et al., 2014). It is primarily used to enhance the anaerobic digestion process 
whereby incoming sludge is h eated to high temperatures for a given amount of time before being fed into 
the anaerobic digester. The TH pre -treatment causes partial solubilisation of sludge contents and the 
reduction of the sludge apparent viscosity which in turn ultimately lead to en hancements of the 
subsequent anaerobic digestion process. Thermal hydrolysis improves digestion efficiency, increases 
biogas production and reduces sludge volumes while it also allows increased organic loading rates (Appels 
et al. 2008; Carrère et al., 201 0; Morgan -Sagastume et al., 2011). Thermal hydrolysis typically operates at 
160 – 180 °C although lower temperature ranges (60 – 150 °C) have also been reported (Abe et al., 2013; 
Bougrier et al., 2006; Gavala et al., 2003; Hammadi et al., 2012). Typical t reatment times range from 30 – 
60 minutes (Donoso -Bravo et al., 2011; Kepp et al., 2000; Li and Noike, 1992) but treatment time as low 
as 60 seconds have also been reported (Dohanyos et al., 2004).  
Thermal hydrolysis has been found to be more effective whe n used on waste activated sludge (WAS) 
(Perez -Elvira et al., 2008; Bougrier et al., 2007) which is known to have poor biodegradability. Waste 
activated sludge is a biological suspension of bacteria and organic particulates, which are held together in 
gel-like biofilm matrices called extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Li & Ganczarczyk, 1990; Neyens 
et al., 2004). It is understood that EPS makes up a significant portion in WAS, representing up to 80 % of 
its mass (Frolund et al., 1996). Recently, it ha s been shown that the presence of EPS content and solids 
content correlates strongly with the rheological behaviour of WAS (Feng et al, 2014; Feng et al. 2016).  
It is known that TH reduces the apparent viscosity of treated sludge. However, comprehensive r heological 
studies on TH treated sludge is relatively scarce. Bougrier et al. (2008) reported shear -thinning behaviour 
in thermally treated WAS where the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing treatment temperature 
up to 150 °C, above which it remain ed constant, suggesting a 150 °C threshold temperature for changes 
in sludge physical characteristics. Perez -Elvira et al., (2010) also reported shear -thinning behaviour in 
treated sludge with 70% decrease in sludge viscosity after  TH at 170 °C and 3 0 minutes. The changes were 
attributed to reduced inter -floc resistance due to breakage of sludge floc structure during TH. Carvajal et 
al. (2013) performed a thermal treatment process at low temperatures (55 °C, 24 hours) on WAS and 
reported that the yiel d stress of treated sludge was decreased by 82 %.  
Recently, Feng et al. (2014) investigated the rheological properties of WAS after thermal treatment at 
170 °C for 60 minutes. It was found that the shear -thinning behaviour and thixotropic property of sludg e 
became less apparent after TH. The storage modulus was also decreased by 92.5 % following TH. Sludge  
101 
 solids concentration was found to have a significant impact on the rheology of both treated and untreated 
sludge. Similarly, Feng et al. (2014b) reported  that the behaviour of 5.4 wt% WAS changed from a 
Herschel -Bulkley fluid to a Newtonian fluid following 1 -hour TH at 170 °C. The storage modulus also 
decreased significantly, and treated sludge was predominantly described by viscous forces. These changes 
were attributed to the destruction of floc and hydrolysis of macromolecular components. Urrea et al. 
(2015) investigated the rheological changes of 2.33 wt% WAS due to TH at 160 – 200 °C and 40 – 80 bar. 
It was found that untreated sludge behaved as a Bingh am plastic material. During the initial stages of TH, 
the authors reported that the sludge behaviour became pseudoplastic, whereas by the end of the 
treatment period, they observed that the sludge behaved as a Newtonian fluid. The changes observed 
were att ributed to destruction of flocs and release of polymers due to cell lysis. They also showed   that 
the reduction of total suspended solids was the main contributor of the observed changes in rheological 
properties of sludge, leading to Newtonian behaviour.  
During TH, it is believed that the heating of sludge causes microorganism cell walls to rupture, EPS to 
become degraded, and particulate organic compounds be converted into lower molecular weight 
compounds (Bougrier et al., 2008; Everett, 1972; Neyens & B aeyens, 2004; Neyens & Baeyens, 2003).  
However, more systematic studies on the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved in sludge TH are not 
well documented. Takamatsu et al. (1970) proposed a mathematic model which described thermal 
decomposition of WAS  in terms of solubilisation of solid matter into soluble evaporative matter and 
soluble non -evaporative matter. Performing TH at 170 – 250 °C, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in 
sludge solids decreased while COD in the soluble matter increased. Total COD in sludge remained 
unchanged. Imbierowicz and Chacuk (2012) modelled TH in a lumped kinetic model which assumed that 
two parallel first -order reactions occurred during heating of WAS. The first described the thermal 
destruction and solubilisation of sludge  particles to organic carbon while the second parallel reaction led 
to a solid phase, which can be decomposed into CO 2.   In the recent review, Barber (2016) surmised that 
with increasing temperature, a sequence of reactions in sludge would occur as: i) so lubilisation of bulk 
material, ii) release of loosely -bound polysaccharides from extra -cellular polymers (ECP), iii) destruction 
of tightly bound ECP, degradation of cell walls and eventual rupture, iv) release of intracellular proteins, 
which eventually t he interaction between polysaccharides and proteins led to producing non -
biodegradable high molecular weight products.  
The solubilisation of organic compounds in sludge has been reflected as an increase in COD in the soluble 
phase of sludge (Farno et al.,  2015; Li and Noike, 1992). Li and Noike (1992) reported that the soluble COD  
102 
 of WAS was considerably high after thermal treatment at 120 – 175 °C. This was considered due to 
particulate organics being hydrolysed into soluble matter by thermal treatment. B ougrier et al. (2008) also 
reported COD solubilisation after thermal treatment (90 – 210 °C), which increased linearly with treatment 
temperature. Perez et al. (2010) reported an increase in soluble COD after thermal treatment (170 °C, 30 
minutes) and cons iders that this was due to the lysis of cells and destruction of floc structure in sludge. 
The hydrolysed sludge was also dewatered more easily. Appels (2010) reported increased soluble COD in 
the water phase after sludge was thermally treated (70 – 90 °C) . This was found to be due to disruption 
of chemical bonds of the cell walls and membranes of microorganisms in the sludge, which releases 
intracellular organic material into the water phase. Morgan -Sagastume (2011) found that soluble COD 
increased greatly  after TH (160 °C) and viscosity was also decreased. Furthermore, it was found that the 
total COD of sludge were relatively constant after TH, suggesting that degradation of organic matter was 
not significant.  
In the above -mentioned studies, all rheologica l characterisations had been performed at ambient 
conditions after TH, which does not consider changes as a result of the sludge being cooled down after 
TH. Limited studies are available where sludge rheological measurement was performed under TH 
condition s. Farno et al. (2015) studied the rheological behaviour of WAS under thermal treatment 
temperature. However, the temperatures investigated (50 – 80 °C) were much lower than those typically 
encountered in TH. It was also found that the yield stress and inf inite shear viscosity of sludge decreased 
linearly with increasing treatment temperature and logarithmically decreased over time at constant 
temperature. Furthermore, the rate of decrease of yield stress and infinite shear viscosity was found to 
be linearl y proportional to the rate of solubilisation of organic matter in the sludge. As a result, it was 
suggested that rheological measurements can be used to predict organic matter solubilisation in the 
sludge.  However, no study has shown whether this linear r elationship is applicable for high pressure and 
high temperature thermal treatment.  
The current study aims to investigate the rheological changes in thickened WAS under high temperature 
(80 – 145 °C) and high pressure (5 bar) conditions during 60 minutes o f TH treatment. The aim is to study 
the rheological changes in sludge as TH progresses while the changes in organic matter solubilisation 
(sCOD) was simultaneously monitored to study their correlation.

 4.3 MATERIALS AND ME THODS  
4.3.1 WASTE ACTIVATED SLUDGE  
Waste activated sludge for the experiments was collected from Mount Martha wastewater treatment 
plant in Victoria, Australia. The collected sludge was thickened by dissolved air flotation in the treatment 
plant without any polymer dosing. The sludge had an initial solids concentration of 3.5 wt% at the time of 
collection and was stored at 4 °C for up to 30 days before use. This was done in order to minimize changes 
in the sludge due to biological activity and to help ensure the stability an d consistency between samples 
during measurement (Curvers et al., 2009). A centrifuge was used to thicken the sludge to 7 wt% solids 
concentration at 9,000 rpm (~13,700 G) for 20 minutes. The sludge concentration was adjusted by diluting 
the centrifuge thi ckened sludge with the non -centrifuged sludge until the desired concentration was 
obtained. The solids concentration was determined by drying the sludge in an oven at 105 °C for over 24 
hours until constant mass was obtained (APHA, 1992).  
 
4.3.2 RHEOLOGICA L MEASUREMENTS  
Rheological measurements were conducted using a stress -controlled rheometer (DHR3, TA Instruments). 
The rheometer is equipped with a pressure cell where the temperature can be monitored and controlled 
via a water -cooled Peltier jacket. The p ressure cell operates based on a cup -and-bob geometry, with bob 
diameter of 26 mm and cup diameter of 28 mm.  For rheology measurement, 10 mL of sludge sample was 
introduced into the pressure cell at room temperature. Nitrogen gas was used to purge air out  of the 
system. The pressure cell was then sealed, and a syringe pump was used to pressurize the cell to 5 bar 
using nitrogen gas. Air was removed from the system in order to limit any oxidation reactions which may 
occur due to presence of oxygen gas. The pressure applied (5 bar) also ensures that sludge remains in the 
liquid phase during measurement at elevated temperatures, mimicking conventional TH processes. A 
shear rate of 10 s-1 was applied on the sludge for 3 minutes in order to homogenize the sample  in the 
pressure cell. Then a shear rate of 675 s-1 was applied for 20 minutes on the sludge as a pre -shearing step 
in order to erase any shear history on the sample. The shear rate of 675 s-1 was the maximum shear rate 
limit of the pressure cell setup. An  equilibrium period of 2 minutes with zero shear rate was then applied. 
Following that, a flow curve was generated for the sludge at 25 °C (i.e. untreated sludge). The sludge was 
then heated to the desired experiment temperature (80, 90, 100, 120, 130, 145  °C), with heating times 
averaging between 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the target temperature. Once the temperature was  
104 
 reached, the pre -shearing step was applied again with shear rate of 675 s -1 for 2 minutes, followed by 1 
minute of equilibration. Thi s was done in order to erase the shear history during the previous flow curve 
measurements and heating time. The sludge would then remain at the target temperature for a period of 
60 minutes, over which time, a series of flow curve measurements was carried  out periodically. The same 
pre-shearing procedure (675 s-1 for 2 minutes followed by 1 -minute equilibrating) was applied prior to 
each flow curve measurement.  The flow curve measurements were done by performing a logarithmic 
sweep of decreasing shear rat es (600 – 0.1 s-1, 10 data points per decade) in 120 seconds. This way, flow 
curves could be generated to depict the periodic changes in sludge rheological behaviour during 60 -
minute TH under elevated temperature and pressure conditions.  
The starting poin t for measurements was defined as the moment when the sample has reached the 
desired experiment temperature. The measured sample remained in the closed rheometer system 
throughout the entire measurement period. This was done to observe the sludge rheologic al changes 
under conditions mimicking TH processes, as it progresses over time.  
 
4.3.3 CHEMICAL OXYGE N DEMAND  
Changes in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the soluble phase of sludge were investigated in a 
separate reactor, using similar conditions as th e rheological measurements. Using a 100 mL high pressure 
reactor (Parr Instrument Company), sludge samples were subjected to thermal hydrolysis treatment at 
100, 120, 130, and 145 °C. Sludge was introduced into the reactor which was then purged with nitrog en 
gas to remove excess air. The reactor was sealed and pressurized to 5 bar using a syringe pump. The 
reactor was heated via a heating jacket up to the desired target temperature, with an average heating 
time of 10 minutes. Once the target temperature was  reached, the sludge was held at constant 
temperature for 60 minutes. Periodically, 5 – 10 mL samples of the sludge were collected for COD analysis 
via a sampling tube. The reactor was permanently connected to the syringe pump for the duration of the 
test,  which ensured that the pressure remained constant in the reactor. The sludge samples were 
collected in sealed tubes which were quickly cooled by dipping in an ice bath. The hydrothermally treated 
sludge samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (12,100 G) for 20 minutes, and the centrate was 
filtered through mixed cellulose ester membranes (0.45 µm pore size) for soluble COD (sCOD) 
measurement. Chemical oxygen demand measurement in the filtered centrate was performed following 
HACH procedure (using COD h igh range plus reagents, DR5000 Spectrophotometer and DRB200 reactor). 
The increase in soluble COD (rsCOD) in the sludge was defined as follows:   
105 
 𝑟𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷=(𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷𝑇−𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷0)
𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷0𝐸𝑞.4.1 
where sCOD T represents the soluble COD (mg/L) of the sludge collected any point during thermal 
hydrolysis treatment and sCOD 0 represents the soluble COD (mg/L) of the sludge prior to any thermal 
hydrolysis treatment, measured at 25 °C.  
 
4.4 RESULTS AND DISC USSION  
4.4.1 FLOW BEHAVIOUR  
Flow curves were generated at v arious time intervals during 60 min TH of 7 wt% WAS at different 
temperatures. Figure 4.1 shows the impact of temperature (a) and treatment time (b) on the shear stress 
– shear rate response of sludge during TH. Figure 4.1 -a shows individual flow curves fo r sludge under 
different treatment temperatures, measured at 30 minutes. The sludge exhibits shear -thinning behaviour 
at all temperatures investigated. By increasing temperature, the shear stress response at any given shear 
rate was reduced, showing that s ludge became less resistant to flow. Figure 4.1 -b shows flow curves of 
sludge treated at constant temperature of 120 °C for different time intervals, up to 1 hour of treatment. 
As treatment time progresses, the sludge also became less resistant to flow. In  general, with increasing 
treatment temperature, the apparent viscosity of sludge decreases, and at constant treatment 
temperature it decreases over time. This suggests that physico -chemical changes due to TH may continue 
to occur progressively over time, rather than instantaneously upon reaching treatment temperature. This 
is interesting because there are contradictory opinions on the treatment time requirements in TH. Some 
studies suggested long reaction times are necessary, while others opposed that (Bar ber, 2016).  
All flow curves generated at the investigated temperatures at any treatment time (Figure 4.1), or at 
different treatment time at any studied temperatures, as in Figure 4.2, could best be described by the 
Herschel -Bulkley model:  
𝜎 = 𝜎𝑐+𝑘𝛾̇𝑛𝐸𝑞.4.2  
Where σ is the shear stress (Pa); σc is the yield stress (Pa); γ̇ is the shear rate (s-1); k is the consistency index 
(Pa.sn); and n is the flow index.   
106

and (b) at different times during thermal hydrolysis at 120 °C treatment temperature.   
 
107 
 At all different temperatures investigated, it was found that the sludge flow curves followed the same 
curvature ev en at different times across the 60 -minutes treatment period. This indicated that the same 
physical phenomenon governs at different temperatures and treatment time. As such, a master flow curve 
was generated to encapsulate all flow curves obtained from the  different temperatures and times of 
treatment. The aim was to obtain a single equation useful for design purposes. The master curve was then 
developed using a dimensionless form of the Herschel -Bulkley fluid model:  
𝜎𝜎𝑐⁄= 1+𝛽𝛤𝑛𝐸𝑞.4.3 
where  
𝛤 = (𝜂𝜎𝑐⁄).𝛾̇ 𝐸𝑞.4.4 
𝛽 =(𝑘𝜎𝑐⁄)∙(𝜎𝑐𝜂⁄)𝑛𝐸𝑞.4.5 
Where Γ and σ/σc are the dimensionless shear rate and shear stress, and η is a measure of the apparent 
viscosity and equals 1 Pa.s . 
Using the dimensionless Herschel -Bulkley model allows all flow curves to be more precisely compared 
between one another. The shear stress values have been scaled according to the yield stress, which 
describes the particle interaction network strength of th e sludge at rest, thus normalizing all flow curves 
to the same point of reference. To maintain consistent comparisons, a dimensionless form for shear rates 
was used, and defined as in equation 4. Here, η represents the viscosity of an equivalent suspension  of 
force -free particles in water, which can be assumed to have a value of 1 Pa.s (Baudez et al., 2004; Coussot, 
1995).  
One flow curve from the measured data was chosen as a reference curve. In this case, the flow curve 
generated for sludge treated at 80 °C measured at 1 minute during thermal treatment was chosen as the 
reference curve. The Herschel -Bulkley parameters ( k, σc, and  n) for the reference curve were determined 
via iterative calculation (for shear rates 10 – 600 s-1) such that the error between values predicted by the 
Herschel -Bulkley parameters and the measured data were minimized. For the reference curve, the 
Herschel -Bulkley parameters were found to be as: yield stress, σc = 20.38 Pa, consistency index, k = 2.04 
Pa.sn, and flow index, n = 0.5.  The other flow curves representing the sludge rheology at various points in 
time during 60 -minutes thermal hydrolysis at different treatment temperatures (80 – 145 °C) were scaled 
such that they superimposed onto the reference curve. This was achieved by dividing the shear stress and 
shear rate values for each curve by a certain value. The factor by which the flow curves were scaled along  
108 
 the shear stress axis (y -axis) is defined as Sy, and along shear rate axis (x -axis), it is defined as Sx. Sy and Sx 
are referred as the y and x axis shift factors, respectively. The consistency index and yield stress for the 
flow curve of sludge at different temperature and treatment time were then determined based on the 
shift factor values and master curve parameters (Es htiaghi et al., 2016) as the following:  
𝑘=𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑆𝑦
𝑆𝑥𝑛) 𝐸𝑞.4.6 
𝜎𝑐=𝜎𝑐(𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟)∙𝑆𝑦 𝐸𝑞.4.7 
It is worth noting, the yield stress being reported in the present study refers to the dynamic yield stress 
of the sludge at steady flow con ditions. This means the yield stress was obtained via curve -fitting of flow 
curve data, measured at decreasing shear rates, to the Herschel -Bulkley model. Figure 4.2 shows the 
master flow curve representing rheological behaviour of 7 wt% WAS at 5 -minute ti me intervals across 60 -
minutes TH for different treatment temperatures (80, 90, 100, 120, 130 and 145 °C.), as well as for 
untreated sludge at 25 °C.  Using the master flow curve, the Herschel -Bulkley parameters for sludge ( k 
and σc) at specific treatment temperature and time interval can be determined using corresponding shift 
factors presented in Table 4.1. Note that in Fig. 2, all flow curves were not shifted along the X -axis, so S x = 
1 for any given time and treatment temperature.

 The calculated Herschel -Bulkley parameters of yield stress, σc (Pa) and consistency index, k (Pa.sn) at 
different treatment times and different treatment temperatures are shown in Table 4.2. The goodness of 
fit of the Herschel -Bulkley model and corresponding parameters in describing each flow curve was 
assessed using a Chi -Square test (α = 0.05). This was  done by comparing the shear stress values observed 
from experimental data with the shear stress values calculated from the model at shear rates 10 – 600 s-
1. No significant difference was shown between the estimated values and experimental data. The mean 
absolute percentage error between experimental data and values estimated from the Herschel -Bulkley 
parameters corresponding to the respective sludge treatment conditions are shown in Table 4.2. Table 
4.2 also shows HB parameters of the sludge measured at 2 5 °C (untreated sludge), prior to heating, and 
the parameters for the sludge, after 1 -hour TH and cooling down to 25 °C.

 Figure 4.3 shows the impact of treatment temperature on the high -shear viscosity (a) and yield stress (b) 
of sludge. The high -shear viscosity, η∞, describes the apparent viscosity of the sludge measured at 600 s-1 
shear rate. This shear rate was the maximu m limit of the pressure cell attachment used for measurement 
on the rheometer. At high shear rates, the hydrodynamic interactions are predominant which tends to a 
more Newtonian behaviour. At this shear rate, a better comparison can be made across the diff erent 
samples. During treatment, the in -situ yield stress, σc,I, and in -situ high -shear viscosity, η∞,i decreased 
linearly with increasing sludge temperature. Following TH at various temperatures, η∞,f and σc,f were 
determined. These represent the high -shear viscosity and yield stress of the sludge after being cooled 
down to 25 °C, following 60 -minute TH.  For the treated sludge, η∞,f and σc,f decreased linearly with 
increasing treatment temperature. Comparing the high -shear viscosity of sludge before and a fter 60 -
minute TH, the high -shear viscosity decreased irreversibly by 28%, 38%, 53%, 70% and 87% for treatment 
temperatures of 80, 100, 120, 130 and 145 °C  respectively. Similarly, yield stress of sludge  was also 
reduced irreversibly by 29%, 37%, 55%, 71% and 89% following 60 minutes TH at 80, 100, 120, 130 and 
145 °C  respectively.  
On the other hand, it is also apparent that for all TH temperatures investigated, the high -shear viscosity 
and yield stress is lower when measured, in -situ, at TH conditions ( η∞,i and σc,i) compared to measuring 
the samples after cooling down to room temperature ( η∞,f and σc,f). The high -shear viscosity in the reactor 
was less than the high -shear viscosity of cooled sludge after TH by 48%, 61%, 77%, 77% and 86% at 80, 
100, 120, 130 and 145 °C,  respectively. The yield stress of sludge would also be less during TH compared 
to cooled, treated sludge by 47%, 60%, 74%, 74%, and 82% at 80, 100, 120, 130 and 145 °C  respectively. 
This suggests that rheological data measured for cool ed sludge after undergoing TH does not directly 
reflect the behaviour of sludge during TH. Knowing this, the actual value of η∞,i and σc,i during TH at various 
treatment temperatures could be estimated based on cooled, post -treatment sludge measurements (a t 
room temperature).

Where η∞,i and η∞,f (Pa.s)  are the high -shear viscosity measured at the treatment temperature, and at 25 °C 
after TH, r espectively; σc,i and σc,f are the yield stress (Pa) measured at treatment temperature , and yield 
stress (Pa) measured at 25 °C after TH, respectively. T stands for treatment temperature (°C).   
112 
 These results agree with findings of Farno et al. (2016), where  the yield stress and apparent viscosity of 
cooled sludge also decreased with increasing treatment temperature (50 – 80 °C) as a result of thermal 
treatment compared to the initial untreated sludge. However, they reported a more significant yield stress 
reduction for 7 wt% WAS following thermal treatment at 80 °C. The yield stress reduced by 68% (106 Pa 
to 33.6 Pa after TH) as opposed to 29% reduction (45 Pa to 31 Pa after TH) observed in the present study. 
This difference is possibly due to different sampl e preparation methods. In the present study, the sludge 
samples were thickened via centrifuge which may cause differences in floc or network structure of the 
untreated sludge. Besides, the dynamic yield stress is being presented in the current study, as op posed to 
static yield stress in the aforementioned study.  The yield stress of a material which  describes the 
minimum stress that must be applied to induce a continuous flow in material is an indication of the 
structure and network strength of sludge (Esht iaghi et al., 2013). So, by decreasing yield stress due to 
thermal hydrolysis, this could indicate changes to the structural integrity of the sludge at elevated 
temperatures. On the other hand, Urrea (2015) reported for a 2.33 wt% WAS with initial yield st ress of 
3.7 Pa, the yield stress was reduced to zero almost immediately upon reaching TH temperature. However, 
this may be due to the lower sludge solids concentration used in their study and the higher TH 
temperature employed (160 °C).  
The evolution of th e sludge Herschel -Bulkley parameters with treatment time were investigated at 
different treatment temperatures. Figure 4.4 -a shows the evolution of ki/k0 with time at different TH 
temperatures. Here, ki is the consistency index of the sludge at the measured treatment temperature and 
time whereas k0 is the consistency of the sludge before TH, measured at 25 °C. For all treatment 
temperatures, ki/k0 decreased gradually over the 60 -minute TH period. The same  behaviour is observed 
for the σc,i/σc,0 as shown in Figure 4.4 -b, where  σc,i is the yield stress of sludge measured at the treatment 
temperature and specific treatment time and σc,0 is the original yield stress of sludge before TH, measured 
at 25 °C. For each treatment temperature, both the yield stress and consistency index showed a more 
rapid logarithmic decrease in the initial 5 - 10 minutes of treatment time, before becoming more gradual. 
Similarly, figure 4.4 -c shows the change in high -shear viscosity  of sludge (over 1 -hour TH at different 
temperatures. Here, η∞,i is the apparent viscosity of sludge measured at shear rate of 600 s-1 during TH, 
whereas η∞,0 is the apparent viscosity of sludge at 600 s-1 shear rate measured at 25 °C before heating 
(untre ated sludge).

4.4.2 COD SOLUBILISA TION  
The impact of TH treatment at different temperatures (100 °C, 120 °C, 130 °C, and 145 °C) on the soluble 
COD was investigated. Figure 4.5 shows the increase of soluble COD (rsCOD) in sludge at different 
treatment temperatures during TH. Here, the data shown describes the rsCOD change across the entire 
TH process, starting from r oom temperature. In other words, the data describes the changes occurring 
during the heating phase of the process as well as during the constant temperature treatment phase. 
Depending on treatment temperature, sludge heating took 10 -15 min. This was follow ed by 60 min at 
constant temperature. The rsCOD increased rapidly during the heating phase (represented as the initial 
10- 15 minutes) in Fig. 5. After that, the rsCOD increased gradually at constant temperature. This suggests 
the rsCOD change is strongly influenced by temperature. It is reasonable to assume that at the TH 
conditions investigated (80 -145 °C, 5 bar, no oxygen), destruction of organic material does not occur and 
the total COD in the sludge remains unaltered by TH (Aggrey et al., 2012; Imbiero wicz & Chacuk, 2012; 
Morgan -Sagastume et al., 2011).

 Omitting the data for the heating phase, Figure 4.5 (inset) shows only the rsCOD chang e at constant 
temperature, once the desired temperature was reached. At constant temperature, the increase of rsCOD 
with time follows a logarithmic trend for all temperatures investigated. The rsCOD was also found to 
increase linearly with increasing treat ment temperature at fixed time. At constant temperature, the 
rsCOD continues to increase gradually with time over 60 minutes. Multiple regression analysis was 
performed to generate an equation for predicting the rsCOD (excluding heating phase) as a functio n of 
treatment temperature and treatment time:

 The behaviour observed here is comparable to that found in literature. Everett (1972) reported that the 
concentration of dissolved volatile solids, which can be related with sCOD, increased with increasing 
treatment time and temperature (150 –190 °C). Valo et al. (2004) reported an increase in sCOD with 
increasing temperature (130 – 150 °C) but found that increasing treatment time only produced gradual 
increases in sCOD during 60 -minute treatment. Qiao et al. (2011) also reported slight increase in sCOD 
over time during 60 -minute treatment (120 – 190 °C). On the other hand, Donoso -Bravo et al. (2011) 
reported a continuous increase in sCOD during initial 15 minutes of TH (170 °C) of sludge, after that the 
value remained constant upwards to 30 minutes. Imbierowicz & Chacuk (2012) reported an increase of 
total organic carbon in the liquid phase (TOC L) during TH of WAS (150 – 220 °C). It was found that for 2 h 
thermal hydrolysis at 150 and 170 °C, the TOC L increased  rapidly during the initial 20 minutes, after which 
it became more gradual. In the current study, it is noted that COD analysis is unable to perform 
measurements at high precision. Therefore, minute variations in COD during TH may be undetectable, 
owing to  the variable nature of the sludge samples and errors inherent the COD analysis method itself.  
However, it is known that TH leads to solubilisation of particulate organic compounds in WAS and is 
reflected as changes in sCOD. In turn, the changes in sCOD c ould be a further indication of the physical 
changes occurring in the sludge.  
It is notable that in the present study, the significant portion of rsCOD increase also mainly occurs within 
20 minutes of reaching steady TH temperature, similar to those repor ted in other studies. Major changes 
in the yield stress and viscosity were also primarily observed during the initial 10 – 20 minutes of reaching 
constant temperature. The rheological changes due to TH observed in the current study, which can 
generally be described as a reduction in the resistance to flow, is most likely a result several changes 
occurring in the sludge due to the impact of TH.  It is known that during TH, the cell walls of microorganism 
which make up a large portion of WAS are destroyed, re leasing soluble cell contents (Everett, 1972). 
Insoluble proteins are also broken down into soluble amino acids. The EPS and large sludge particles, 
which contribute to the floc structure of sludge and its ability to retain water, are also broken down 
(Bou grier et al., 2008; Neyens et al., 2004). The EPS has been found to correlate strongly with the 
rheological behaviour of sludge (Feng et al., 2016) and it is very likely that floc structure and sludge particle 
sizes also contribute to the sludge rheology. As the EPS is solubilised and floc structure is broken down, 
accompanied by the destruction of sludge particles and release of bound water, these changes are 
reflected in the rheological changes observed. Furthermore, these changes are also reflected as an  
increase in soluble COD, as a portion of organic compounds constituting a solid phase become more 
solubilised (Imbierowicz & Chacuk, 2012). From the experimental results (Figure 4.4 -a & b), the apparent  
118 
 viscosity, yield stress and consistency index decrea se rapidly at first (5 – 10 minutes) and then reduces 
gradually over the treatment period. On the other hand, the sCOD was found to increase rapidly initially 
before becoming more gradual during constant temperature treatment (Fig.5). Both behaviours were 
found to follow logarithmic trends. Comparing the rsCOD data to the rheological data, Figure 4.6 shows 
the correlation between rsCOD to σ c,i/σc,0 and η∞,i/ η∞,0. It can be seen that rsCOD is linearly proportional 
to both parameters, whereby an increase in the soluble COD correlates to a decrease in yield stress and 
apparent viscosity for the sludge. Farno et al. (2015), also reported that change rsCOD had a stron g linear 
proportionality to change in yield stress and apparent viscosity for WAS thermally treated at low 
temperature (50 – 80 °C). However, the present study was not able to reproduce as strong of a linear fit 
as observed in Farno et al. (2015). This is most likely a result of the complicated methodology required for 
sampling and analysing of sludge COD at much higher treatment temperature and pressure conditions 
leading to high variability in results. However, it is reasonable to expect that the same cor relation would 
also exist at the higher temperature conditions used in the present study, since it has been shown that 
the removal of total COD from sludge is minimal even at 150 °C and the solubilisation of sludge is the 
primary outcome of TH (Imbierowicz  & Chacuk, 2012). This correlation suggests that the potential exists 
for using on -line rheological measurements as a tool for monitoring the performance of TH processes at 
high temperature and pressure conditions in terms of the solubilisation of sludge.

as well as after sample has reached constant treatment temperature.

 4.5 CONCLUSION  
Thermal hydrolysis significantly impacts the physical properties of WAS. Afte r 60-minute TH at 80 – 145 °C, 
the yield stress and apparent viscosity of sludge is irreversibly altered. The yield stress and apparent 
viscosity of treated sludge decreased linearly with increasing treatment temperature. Over the course of 
TH, WAS behaved  as a shear -thinning fluid with yield stress which could be described by the Herschel -
Bulkley model. This was true at any time during 60 -minutes TH at the temperatures studied. A master 
flow curve was developed which can be used to describe the rheological  behaviour of sludge at the TH 
conditions investigated.  Furthermore, the rheological changes were found to occur dynamically over the 
course of the treatment period. The yield stress and apparent viscosity of WAS decreased linearly with 
increasing treatme nt temperature. At constant temperature, the yield stress and apparent viscosity 
decreased logarithmically with time, with the majority of changes occurring within the first 10 minutes 
upon reaching treatment temperature. Similarly, during TH at constant t emperature, soluble COD of 
sludge was also found to increase logarithmically with treatment time which the majority of increase 
happened within the initial 10 – 20 minutes.  
It was also found that a linear correlation exists between increasing soluble COD with the decreasing yield 
stress and apparent viscosity of sludge. This suggests that there is potential for using on -line rheological 
measurement as a tool for monitoring the performance of TH.

 5.1 ABSTRACT  
Thermal hydrolysis (TH) is a promising pre -treatment method for the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge 
involving the solubilization of sludge at elevated temperature conditions. However, rheological studies on 
sludge at TH conditions are relatively scarce, while most available studies were performed on treated 
sludge after it was cooled to ambient temperatures. Furthermore, increasingly thicker sludge types are 
being used in TH, so the imp act of higher sludge concentrations will also be of interest. The flow behaviour 
of waste activated sludge (WAS) at various solids concentrations (7 – 13 wt.%) was studied under elevated 
temperature conditions (80 – 140 °C) such as those found during TH pr ocesses. During 60 –minutes TH at 
constant temperature, WAS rheological behaviour was best described by the Herschel -Bulkley model at 
all conditions studied. The apparent viscosity, yield stress and consistency index showed logarithmic 
relationship with tre atment time. At constant time and solids concentration, linear relationship was 
observed between treatment temperature and apparent viscosity, yield stress and consistency index. 
With increasing solids concentration, the apparent viscosity, yield stress an d consistency index increased 
following a power law at all temperatures and time studied. This power -law relationship between 
rheological parameters and sludge concentration existed despite elevated temperature conditions of TH. 
Results also suggested that  the proportion of sludge solubilization and its rate were unaffected by varying 
sludge concentration. Linear proportionality existed between the extent of sludge solubilisation and 
rheological parameters. The evolution of rheological parameters in -situ du ring TH were described by 
regression models.  
5.2 INTRODUCTION  
Today, anaerobic digestion remains a promising technique for sewage sludge treatment owing to its 
potential for energy recovery in the form of biogas production (Appels et al., 2008; Zhen et al. , 2017). The 
large quantity of sewage sludge produced has led to continuous development of different sludge pre -
treatment strategies (Ariunbaatar et al., 2014; Zhen et al., 2017). A pre -conditioning step is now also 
viewed as an essential component in anae robic digesters, whereby a pre -treatment process makes the 
incoming sludge more amenable to digestion, greatly improving anaerobic digestion performance. Among 
the pre -treatment techniques, hydrothermal methods such as thermal hydrolysis (TH) have shown 
favourable  outcomes and received wide industrial applications, with commercial examples such as full -
scale CambiTHPTM and Biothelys® processes (Barber, 2016; Sapkaite et al., 2017; Zhen et al., 2017).   
126 
 Thermal hydrolysis involves subjecting sludge t o high temperatures conditions for fixed time in order to 
solubilize sludge contents and improve its digestibility. The high temperatures applied cause cell 
membranes to disintegrate and results in the solubilization of sludge particles and organic compoun ds 
(Ariunbaatar et al., 2014; Suárez -Iglesias et al., 2017). Thermal hydrolysis processes typically occur in the 
temperature range of 100 – 200 °C (Hii et al., 2014). In the case of TH, most studies have found the optimal 
temperature to be around 170 °C, w ith treatment times of 30 – 60 minutes (Zhen et al., 2017). However, 
lower temperature thermal pre -treatment processes (<100 °C) have also shown to be promising (Liao et 
al., 2016; Nazari et al., 2017).  
Waste activated sludge (WAS) is the main sludge type primarily handled in TH processes. It has been 
shown that the effects of TH are more pronounced on WAS due to its high carbohydrate and protein 
content (Barber, 2016; Wilson and Novak, 2009). Waste activated sludge is a biological suspension 
consisting of organic particulates and bacteria held together in flocs by gel -like biofilm matrices called 
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Neyens et al., 2004). The EPS represents up to 80% of its mass 
(Frølund et al., 1996) and plays a key part in the structu ral integrity and dewatering characteristics in WAS 
(Zhang et al., 2017). The EPS has also been found to contribute to the rheological behaviour of WAS (Feng 
et al., 2014a, 2016), and the removal of EPS has been shown to reduce WAS viscosity (Sanin, 2002).  
 
The rheological behaviour of WAS is complex, but it is generally accepted that WAS behaves as a non -
Newtonian, shear -thinning fluid. The Herschel -Bulkley model is commonly used to describe the behaviour 
of concentrated WAS (Baudez et al., 2011; Eshtiaghi  et al., 2013; Khalili Garakani et al., 2011). It has been 
shown to exhibit thixotropic properties (Guibaud et al., 2004) and many studies identify the presence of 
a yield stress (Farno et al., 2015; Markis et al., 2014; Ratkovich et al., 2013). The presen ce of yield stress 
was explained by a transition of the WAS from a solid -like to fluid -like behaviour due to rupture in the 
alignment of flocs (Yang et al., 2009). It is also generally understood that the rheological properties of 
WAS become more significa nt with increasing solids concentration. Many studies have reported 
increasing sludge viscosity and consistency index due to increasing solids concentration (Eshtiaghi et al., 
2013; Forster, 2002; Laera et al., 2007; Mori et al., 2006; Sanin, 2002). It is suggested that inter -particle 
interactions become stronger at higher solids content due to larger sizes and closer proximity of particles, 
leading to increased apparent viscosity in sludge (Eshtiaghi et al., 2013). The effect of solids concentration 
on slu dge viscosity and consistency index has been shown to follow an exponential function (Guibaud et 
al., 2004; Markis et al., 2014; Tixier et al., 2003) or power law model (Lotito et al., 1997; Markis et al.,

 2014; Sanin, 2002; Tixier et al., 2003). The yield  stress of WAS also tends to increase with higher solids 
concentration. Mori et al. (2006) observed an exponential increase of yield stress for WAS when solids 
concentration increased from 27 to 57 g/L similar to other researchers (Battistoni et al., 1993;  Riley and 
Forster, 2001). On the other hand, Forster et al. (2002) showed that WAS exhibited yield stress which 
followed a power relationship with solids content (10 – 50 g/L), although at low solids concentrations (<9 
- 11 g/L) the yield stress becomes n egligible. Lotito et al. (1997) similarly reported power relationship 
between yield stress and solids concentration of WAS (0.3 – 5.4 % total solids) and found that rheological 
parameters strongly depended on solids concentration and sludge type and sugges ted that the presence 
of EPS leads to higher viscosities generally observed in WAS. Sanin et al. (2002) found that increasing solids 
concentration (2,000 – 18,000 mg/L) led to decreasing flow index. Mori et al. (2006) similarly reported 
flow index decreasi ng linearly with increasing solids content, suggesting that concentrated sludge became 
increasingly shear thinning. However, these studies are only concerned with the WAS rheology at ambient 
to moderate temperatures.  
Limited studies are available regarding  the rheology of sludge during high temperature processes such as 
TH (Barber, 2016). A better understanding of sludge rheology during TH will be beneficial towards 
optimizing these energy -demanding processes. It is generally accepted that TH greatly alters  sludge 
rheology. However, detailed rheology studies are relatively scarce, and most studies are performed on 
post -treatment sludge at ambient temperature, which may not always be representative of the sludge 
during TH. Dote et al. (1993) showed the appare nt viscosity of thermally treated sludge depended on the 
measurement temperature. Ruffino et al. (2015) performed low temperature TH (90 °C, 3 hours) and 
found that thermally treated sludge exhibited apparent viscosity which was equal to that of untreated 
sludge with half the solids content. Bougrier et al. (2008) showed that the apparent viscosity of treated 
WAS was reduced compared to untreated sludge, and the reduction in apparent viscosity increased with 
increasing TH temperature up to 150 °C. Increasin g TH temperature beyond 150 °C did not lead to further 
reduction in apparent viscosity, suggesting a threshold temperature for changes in sludge physical 
characteristics.  
Feng et al. (2014a) compared the rheological behaviour of untreated WAS and treated WAS after TH 
(170 °C, 60 minutes) at various solids concentrations. They reported that shear -thinning behaviour was 
still exhibited by treated sludge and its non -Newtonian characteristics increased with increasing solid 
content. They showed that the Hersch el-Bulkley model was appropriated for untreated and treated sludge, 
but expressed that the Newtonian fluid model would also be suitable for treated sludge with solid  
128 
 concentrations below 187 g/L. For both treated (54 – 187 g/L) and untreated sludge (20 – 120 g/L), the 
consistency index and apparent viscosity increased with increasing solid content following an exponential 
relationship, but no correlation was found for flow index. They also found that effect of increasing solids 
content on apparent viscosity  was more pronounced in untreated sludge than treated sludge, due to a 
higher exponent value. On the other hand, Feng et al. (2014b) compared the rheological behaviour of 
untreated and treated WAS (5.4 wt% solids content) after 170 °C and 60 minutes by fit ting various 
rheological models. They expressed that the Newtonian fluid model accurately described the treated 
sludge due to high determination coefficient values ( R2), whereas untreated sludge was described by the 
Herschel -Bulkley and power law models. H owever, for treated sludge, the R2 value was comparable 
between the Herschel -Bulkley model ( R2 = 0.94) and Newtonian model ( R2 = 0.95). The authors attributed 
the increased fluidity in treated sludge to the destruction of floc structure and network strengt h within 
the sludge.  
Urrea et al. (2015) investigated the rheology of WAS (23.3 g/L total suspended solids) sampled at different 
times during TH (160 – 200 °C). Flow curves were generated at 25 °C for collected samples. They observed 
different types of fl ow in the sludge during TH. Initially, the untreated sludge was reported to behave as 
a Bingham plastic fluid with yield stress ( σc) of 3.7 Pa, consistency index ( k) of 0.075 Pa.s, and flow index 
(n) of 1. As the sludge was heating up, k increased while n decreased.  However, as constant temperature 
is reached, σc and k decreased, whereas n increased. The final treated sludge was found to behave as a 
Newtonian liquid. They attributed these changes to the reduced interaction between particles and 
polymers due to their decrease in size and quantity. They reported that the total suspended solids (TSS) 
was reduced by 50% after TH and σc was correlated exponentially with increasing TSS (10 – 23 g/L) while 
k and n were fitted to a polynomial function of third and second order, respectively.  
Recently, Hii et al. (2017) studied WAS rheology in -situ at TH conditions (80 – 145 °C) and found that yield 
stress and apparent viscosity of sludge decreased linearly wi th increasing temperature, whereas at 
constant temperature the apparent viscosity, consistency index and yield stress decreased with a 
logarithmic relationship with time. It was also  shown that the viscosity and yield stress of sludge during 
TH deviate by 40 - 80% with respect to the measurement at ambient temperature. Hence, in situ 
characterization is of interest as it offers the accurate sludge rheology in the real TH processes, potentially 
used for better process design. However, the study was limited t o a single concentration of WAS, which 
did not consider the effect of using thicker sludges. Furthermore, there has been great interest for using 
more concentrated sludge during anaerobic digestion (Zhang et al., 2017) due to rheological  
129 
 enhancements cause d by TH (e.g. reducing sludge viscosity) (Morgan -Sagastume et al., 2011). The current 
study investigates the rheological behaviour in various concentrations of thickened WAS under elevated 
temperature conditions like those encountered during TH. It also pr esents correlations for the change of 
Herschel -Bulkley parameters with temperature and time and the extent of organic matter solubilization.  
5.3 MATERIALS AND ME THODS  
5.3.1 WASTE ACTIVATE D SLUDGE  
Waste activated sludge (WAS) originated from Mount Martha w astewater treatment plant in Victoria, 
Australia, which was thickened by dissolved air flotation without polymer dosing. At the time of collection, 
the original solids concentration of the sludge was 3.5 wt%. The sludge was stored at 4 °C for 30 days 
befor e use, which was done to ensure minimal changes in sludge due to biological activity and help 
maintain the stability and consistency between samples during experimentation (Curvers et al., 2009) . 
Sludge was thickened via centrifugation at 9000 rpm (13,700 G). Sludge samples consisting of different 
total solids concentration (TS) were prepared by diluting the centrifuge -thickened sludge using non -
centrifuged sludge to achieve 7, 9, 12, and 13 wt% sludge. The TS of sludge was defined as the percentage 
mass of  dried sludge over the mass of the original sludge. The mass of dried sludge was determined by 
drying the sludge samples to constant mass in an oven at 105 °C (APHA, 1992) . 
 
5.3.2 CHEMICAL ANALY SIS 
The chemical oxygen demand in the soluble phase (sCOD) of the sludge samples was determined for the 
WAS samples. Sludge samples were centrifuged (13,700 G) for 20 minutes, then the centrate was collected 
and filtered through mixed cellulose ester membranes (0.45 µm pore size) via vacuum filtration. Chem ical 
oxygen demand in the filtered sludge liquor was performed following the HACH procedure (COD high 
range plus reagents, DR6000 Spectrophotometer and DRB200 reactor). The COD measurements were 
performed in triplicate. The released COD content in the solu ble phase due to TH was defined rsCOD 
according to Equation 4.1.  
  
130 
 5.3.3 IN -SITU RHEOLO GICAL MEASUREMENT  
Rheological measurements were performed using a pressure cell -equipped, stress -controlled rheometer, 
employing cup -and-bob geometry. Rotational tests we re performed to generate flow curves following 
protocols that was established in Chapter 4.3.2. After sludge samples were introduced, nitrogen gas was 
used to purge air and pressurize the system to 5 bar prior to measurements. This ensures oxidation 
reacti ons and evaporation of samples does not occur during measurements. Prior to measurement, the 
samples were initially pre -sheared at 675 s -1 (maximum shear rate producible from the rheometer with 
pressure cell attachment) for 20 minutes followed by 2 minutes  equilibration at rest to erase sample shear 
history. Flow curves were first generated at 25 °C for untreated samples, and then the samples were 
heated to the desired temperatures (80, 100, 120, 130 and 140 °C). The average heating time to reach 
target tem perature was between 10 and 15 minutes. Temperature was held constant at target 
temperature for 60 minutes and flow curves were generated periodically at 5 -minute intervals during this 
period.  Pre -shearing was applied between generation of each flow curve  (675 s -1 shearing for 2 min, 
followed by 1 min equilibration).  Samples were then allowed to cool to 25 °C, and flow curve for treated 
sludge was generated. Flow curves were generated by applying a logarithmic sweep of decreasing shear 
rates (600 – 0.1 s -1) in 120 s. The raw outputs from the rheometer are published at (Hii and Eshtiaghi, 
2017).  
 
5.3.4 MASTER CURVE D EVELOPMENT  
A master flow curve was generated to characterize the full range of sludge concentrations and 
experimental conditions investigated, as described in Chapter 4.4.1. The master curve was developed 
using a dimensionless form of the Herschel -Bulkley fluid model (Eq. 4.3). The flow curve for 12 wt% WAS 
at 80 °C measured during the first minute of TH was used as the reference curve. Herschel -Bulkley 
parameters for this curve were determined via least squares iterative calculation. In this study, only data 
corresponding to the shear rate range 10 – 600 s-1 was considered due to limited accuracy of the 
rheometer setup for measuring lower shear r ates. For the reference curve, yield stress, σc = 81.33 Pa, 
consistency index, k = 19.97 Pa.s, and flow index, n = 0.4. Note, here σc is the dynamic yield stress of the 
sludge, measured in steady -shear flow; it was mathematically derived by fitting of flow  curve data to the 
Herschel -Bulkley model. It is only representative of the true stress limit below which no steady state flow 
occurs (i.e. static yield stress). All the flow curves generated from the different experimental conditions 
were scaled until the y superimposed onto the reference curve. This was achieved by dividing each set of  
131 
 shear stress and shear rate values for each flow curve by a fixed value, referred to as the shift factors 
(Table A.5.1 – A.5.2). Along the y -axis (shear stress), the flow cu rves were scaled by a factor Sy, whereas 
along the x -axis (shear rate) they were scaled by a factor, Sx. The yield stress and consistency index for 
each flow curve were then determined using the shift factors and master curve parameters, which in this 
case  is equivalent to the Herschel -Bulkley parameters previously calculated for the reference curve. This 
was achieved using equations 4.6 and 4.7.  
 
5.4 RESULTS AND DISC USSION  
The flow curves for WAS measured in situ during TH are shown in Figure 5.1. T he impact of treatment 
duration on the sludge flow behaviour are can be seen in Figure 5.1a which shows sludge flow curves at 
the beginning (1 min) and end (60 min) of TH. At constant temperature, the stress -response of the sludge 
decreased evidently after  60-minutes treatment. The extent of decrease was consistent despite varying 
sludge concentrations. Despite elevated temperatures (80 – 140 °C), WAS behaviour was best described 
by the Herschel Bulkley model (Eq. 4.2). Shear -thinning, yield stress behaviou r was exhibited during the 
entirety of 1 -hour TH.  Newtonian behaviour was not observed at the end of the treatment period, 
contrary to some of the observations reported in literature (Feng et al., 2014b; Urrea et al., 2015) . This 
may be due to the range o f temperatures used in the current study being relatively low compared to the 
TH temperature conditions (160 – 200 °C) reported those studies. Higher sludge concentrations were also 
being used in the current study, which tends to increase non -Newtonian beh aviour (Slatter, 1997). During 
TH, it is believed the elevated temperature conditions results in the destruction of floc structure and 
solubilization of organic matter, which is inferred from the increase in the soluble fraction of COD and 
other macromolec ular components such as soluble proteins and polysaccharides (Hii et al., 2017; Wilson 
and Novak, 2009; Zhang et al., 2017) . As seen in Figure 5.1b, there is distinct difference between the flow 
curves of 80 °C and 130 °C, at the same solid concentration. This solubilization destroys the structural 
integrity of the sludge and releases bound water (Neyens et al., 2004)  which to contributes to the 
rheological changes observed. Then, Figure 5.1a affirms this solubilization eff ect is time dependent . 
Since the general flow behaviour of the WAS during TH was similar across the experimental conditions 
studied, it was possible to develop a master curve (Figure 5.2) to describe the in -situ WAS flow behaviour 
across the wide range of sludge concentrations, temperature and treatment times investigated, as well 
as for untreated and treated sludge measured at 25 °C. Using the master curve, Herschel -Bulkley  
132 
 parameters for WAS could be estimated for any TH conditions and sludg e concentrations within the range 
of conditions studied.  
 
 
Figure 5. 1 – a) In -situ flow curves of 7 - 13 wt% WAS at 130 °C measured at beginning and end of 60 -
minutes TH, and b) Impact of TH temperature on in -situ flow curves  of 7 - 13 wt%, at treatment time of 60 
min.  
 
 
In this case it is considered that the flow index, n = 0.4 since it was observed that all the flow curves 
obtained adequately follows the same curvature in the master curve. The validity of the calculated 
Hers chel-Bulkley parameters obtained from Equations 4.6 and 4.7 was assessed by goodness of fit using 
a Chi -Square test (α = 0.05). The shear stress values obtained experimentally were compared against those 
estimated using the calculated Herschel -Bulkley para meters. There was no significance in difference 
between the experimental data and estimated values. This means that the Herschel -Bulkley parameters 
derived from the master curve could accurately describe the experimental results. Using the parameters 
deriv ed from the master curve also allows the results to be better compared between the different 
samples due to normalization.  
In order to study the impact of the TH parameters on the sludge rheological behaviour, the Herschel -
Bulkley parameters: σc and k were derived  using Equation 4.6 and 4.7 based on the Master curve (Fig. 5.2) . 
Here, σc and k represent the dynamic yield stress and consistency index respectively.  The evolution of 
 
 
133 
 WAS viscosity during TH is shown in Figure 5.3. Here, η∞,i  is the appare nt viscosity of sludge measured in 
situ at shear rate of 600 s-1 (maximum shear rate limit of the pressure cell). Since sludge exhibited shear -
thinning behaviour, it was important to compare only the non -shear rate dependent viscosity values 
between differ ent sludge samples. At 600 s-1, the apparent viscosity approaches a plateauing value and is 
reasonably assumed to approximate the infinite shear viscosity (i.e. limiting viscosity at infinite shear 
rate). At constant temperature, η∞,i decreased rapidly ini tially (10 – 15 minutes) then gradually plateauing 
towards the end of the treatment period. This trend was best described as a logarithmic decrease, similar 
to previously shown for 7% WAS (Chapter 4.4.1). Notably, the same curve trends were observed  for al l 
sludge concentrations studied. This is seen clearer in Figure 5.3 (inset), showing the normalized  apparent 
viscosity ( η∞,i/η∞,0) for different concentrations (7 – 13%). The same observation was also valid for the 
Herschel -Bulkley parameters k and σc (not  shown). A Chi -square test was performed on η∞,i/η∞,0, ki/k0, and 
σc,i/σc,0 at constant time and temperature, comparing between different sludge concentrations and it 
showed insignificant difference of the values between sludge concentrations ( α = 0.05, p = 0.99). This 
suggests the rate and extent of solubilization in the sludge was constant and independent of 
concentration. This is consistent with Imbierowicz and Chacuk (2012) , who showed  the kinetics of sludge 
solubi lization are independent of concentration. Higher sludge concentrations only lead to higher internal 
friction, and hence greater shear stresses observed. Additional figures showing the time -dependent 
evolution of the in -situ η∞,i, ki, and  σc,i during TH at  various temperatures and sludge concentrations are 
presented in supplementary Figures S.5.1 – S.5.3.  
At constant treatment time, sludge rheological parameters were described by linear relationship with 
temperature. An Arrhenius -style relationship was cons idered unsuitable since it assumes constant 
activation energy, which would not be the case in time -dependent sludge thermal treatment (Baudez et 
al., 2013; Farno et al., 2014) . As shown in Figure 5.4 (inset), η∞,i of WAS decreased linearly at all studied 
concentrations; the same was also observed for ki and σc,i (refer to Supplementary Figure S.5.4). In fa ct, 
the impact of temperature on the extent of η∞,i, ki, and σc,i  reduction were comparable for all studied 
concentrations, showing nearly constant curve slopes in Figure 5.4. This suggests sludge concentration 
did not control the extent of sludge solubilization. This was verified using a Chi -square test (α = 0.05) to 
compare the decrease in η∞,i/η∞,0, ki/k0, and σc,i/σc,0 as a function of temperature between different sludge 
concentrations, showing insignificant variation (p = 0.99 across all comparisons). Comparison between the 
η∞,i/η∞,0, ki/k0, and σc,i/σc,0 at differe nt sludge concentrations is shown in the appendix Tables A.5.4 – A.5.6 
with standard deviation values.

Figure 5. 2 – Master flow curve for WAS during thermal hydrolysis, depicting in -situ sludge flow behaviour 
at different concentrations (7, 9, 12, 13 wt%) and different temperatures (80, 100, 120, 130, 140 °C) 
measured at various times, as well as untreated and thermally -treated sludge at 25 °C. Master curve 
equation is σ/σc = 1+βΓn; where Γ = (η/ σc).γ̇ and β = (k/σc).( σc/η)n; k is the consistency index (Pa.sn), σc is 
the yield stress (Pa), γ̇ is the shear rate (s-1), n is the flow index ( -) and η is a measure of the apparent 
viscosity and equals 1 Pa.s. Master curve parameters are: k = 19.97 Pa.sn, σc = 81.33 Pa, and n = 0.4 which 
yields the following equation: σ=81.33 +19.97 γ̇0.4  . 
 
At constant temperature and treatment time, the increasing trends of  η∞,i, ki, and σc,i with sludge 
concentration were described by power -law relationship. This is shown  for the normalized  η∞,i, and σc,i in 
Figure 5.5. Additional figures showing this relationship for non -normalized values of η∞,i, ki, and σc,I are 
available in the supplement ary material (Figure S.5.5) Before and after TH, total  solids concentration of 
WAS was measured, verifying that it remained  constant which was expected since only solubilization 
reactions were expected for TH conditions under nitrogen atmosphere (Hii et al ., 2014) . Although Figure 
5.5 only showed rheological data measured at 60 minutes, the same power -law relationship was observed  
at any time during TH. Furthermore, this relationship was also true for untreated sludge and thermally -
 
135 
 treated sludge measured a t room temperature as well (Figure S.5.6). This is consistent with the power -
law relationship observed for ambient WAS reported in literature (Forster, 2002; Lotito et al., 1997; Markis 
et al., 2014; Sanin, 2002; Tixier et al., 2003) . This means the impact of increasing sludge concentration on 
its rheology are not diminished, despite elevated TH temperatures. It is su spected, with increasing sludge 
concentration, the fundamental actions governing the intensification of viscous forces ( e.g. viscosity  and 
yield stress ) remain the same between untreated WAS at ambient conditions and WAS during TH at 
elevated temperatures. Here, it can be summarised that the role of TS on the sludge rheology remains 
unchanged during TH. As sludge solids content increased, the increasing strength of particle interactions 
lead to higher viscous forces (Markis et al., 2016) .

the same solid concentration before TH (i.e. untreated samples). Inset compares the impact of temperature 
on the raw values of the in -situ high shear viscosity (at 60 minutes) between different sludge

7 wt% WAS, measured at 25 °C, respectively.  
 
The in -situ values of η∞,i (Pa.s), ki (Pa.sn) and σc,i (Pa), at any temperature and time during 60 -minute TH 
can be described as follows, considering the logarithmic time -dependent behaviour and linear 
relationship with temperature:  
𝜂∞,𝑖𝜂∞7,0⁄=−𝐴1(𝑇)−𝐵1ln(𝑡)+𝐶1 (𝐸𝑞.5.1) 
𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−𝐴2(𝑇)−𝐵2ln(𝑡)+𝐶2 (Eq.5.2) 
𝜎𝑐,𝑖𝜎𝑐7,0⁄=−𝐴3(𝑇)−𝐵3ln(𝑡)+𝐶3 (Eq.5.3) 
Where T is the sludge temperature (°C), t is the treatment time (min); η∞7,0 is the high -shear viscosity of 7 
wt% untreated WAS measured at 600 s-1, at 25 °C; k7,0 is the consistency index of 7 wt% untreated W AS at 
25 °C; σc7,0 is the yield stress of 7 wt% untreated WAS at 25 °C; and A1-3 and B 1-3 are fitting parameters and  
C1, C2, and C3 are the η∞,i/η∞7,0, ki/k7,0, and σc,i/σc7,0, respectively, at time = 0 minutes (i.e. when sludge just 
 
138 
 reaches treatment temp erature). A1-3, B 1-3, and C 1-3 can be related to the solids concentration of sludge 
using the following equation:  
𝐹(𝜑)=𝑦 × 𝜑𝑧(Eq.5.4) 
Where F(ϕ) can represent any of the coefficients A1-3, B 1-3, B 2, and C 1-3; ϕ is the solids concentration of 
sludge (wt/wt); y and z are power -law fitting parameters which can be taken from Table 5.1.  
The coefficients A1-3, B 1-3, B 2, and C 1-3 showed power -law relation with solids concentration. This is 
consistent with the power -law relationship for the Herschel -Bulkley parameters with sludge 
concentration observed in Figure 5.5. Equations 5.1 – 5.3 can be used to estimate in situ the apparent 
viscosity and Herschel -Bulkley parameters of WAS (7 – 13 wt%) during TH at different time of treatment 
based on untreated 7% WAS at 25°C. Regression statistics and correlation analysis of parameters are 
presented in Table A.5.3.

The accuracy was higher in the range of 80 – 130 °C, with 4 – 12% mean percentage error (MAPE) of 
estimated values across this temperature range, but the accuracy decreased significantly at 140 °C. This 
is because at 140 °C, rheological changes were seemin gly less time -dependent compared to the lower 
temperatures (80 – 130 °C). That is, rheological values plateaued much earlier. Therefore, the logarithmic 
coefficients in Equations 5.1 – 5.3 would underestimated at 140 °C. Zhang et al. (2017)  have shown  for 
low-temperature TH (<100 °C), treatment time was the dominant factor influencing sludge rheological 
behaviour, while the temperature was the dominant factor for h igh-temperature TH (>100 °C). 
Furthermore, Bougrie r et al. (2008)  suggested that a threshold temperature (150 °C) existed, whereby 
increasing TH temperatures beyond 150 °C would cause insignificant app arent viscosity reduction of 
sludge. As such, the rheological changes have likely approached a limit; the impact of raising treatment 
temperature to 140 °C was also diminished.   
139 
 The variation between rheological measurements performed in situ and measurement performed at 
ambient conditions is evaluated in Table 5.2. Here, in -situ values were taken after 60 minutes treatment 
time (i.e. plateau values), whereas the ambient values were taken after the samples cooled to 25 °C. In all 
cases, in -situ values were 50 – 80% lower than respective ambient counterparts, depending on TH 
temperature. This means ambient rh eological measurements of treated sludge may be scaled accordingly 
to represent in -situ values. Notably, the extent of reduction from ambient values to in -situ values 
remained relatively constant at varying sludge concentrations. For example, the in -situ h igh-shear 
viscosity of 7 – 13 wt% sludge at 100 °C was between 0.4 – 0.5 of ambient values. Equations 5.5 and 5.6 
correlate the in -situ η∞, and σc to ambient values. This allows quick estimation of in -situ rheological 
properties based on ambient measurements of TH sludge when on -line rheological measurements are not 
possible.

𝜎𝑐,𝑖= 𝜎𝑐,𝑓(−0.0036 𝑇+1)             ;         𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=0.08 (𝐸𝑞.5.6) 
Where η∞,i is the in -situ high -shear viscosity (Pa.s) of WAS at 60 minutes treatment time; η∞,f is the high -
shear viscosity (Pa.s) of ambient WAS after thermal hydrolysis measured at 25 °C; σc,i is the in situ yield 
stress (Pa), and  σc,f is the yield stress of thermally -treated WAS  measured at 25 °C. Equation 5.5 can also 
be used to estimate the consistency index by replacing  η∞,i  and η∞,f with the in -situ consistency index, ki, 
and the consistency index of thermally -treated WAS measured at 25 °C, kf, respectively.  
It has previous ly been shown for 7 wt% sludge that the reduction in rheological parameters had a linear 
correlation with an increase of sCOD content (Hii et al., 2017). This correlation was examined here for the 
higher sludge concentrations. The sCOD content of WAS (7, 9 , 12 wt%) before and after 60 –minute TH at 
various temperatures (80, 100, 120, 130, 140 °C) was measured. The extent of COD solubilisation (rsCOD) 
was correlated with the extent of rheological changes due to TH (Figure 5.6). Here, the rheological 
parameter s were normalized whereby η∞,f, kf and σc,f  of thermally treated sludge were divided by the 
corresponding untreated sludge values, η∞,0, k0 and σc,0, at the same sludge concentration.  
 
Linear correlation was observed between rsCOD and the rheological par ameters. The apparent viscosity, 
consistency index, and yield stress decreased proportionally with the extent of sludge solubilization, 
regardless of sludge concentration and treatment temperature. This linear correlation indicates that the 
changes in slud ge rheology due to TH are likely caused by modification in sludge structure resulting from  
140 
 solubilization of sludge components and macromolecules (Bougrier et al., 2008). These structural 
modifications are related to solubilization of EPS, which are capabl e of binding large volumes of water 
(Neyens et al., 2004) and contributes to sludge structural integrity (Feng et al., 2016).  The solubilization 
of EPS leads to a proportional increase in sCOD and flowability of the sludge. The yield stress represents 
the solid -like characteristics in WAS. Its reduction indicates a breakdown of the floc structure in WAS, 
which is reflected in the proportional solubilization in COD. Since the sludge concentration remained 
unchanged after TH it is reasonably concluded that t he rheological changes in WAS due to TH are primarily 
contributed by changes in floc structure and composition of the sludge.

 5.5 CONCLUSION  
The flow behaviour of various concentrations of WAS (7 – 13 wt%) was studied during TH at various 
temperatures (80 – 140 °C). At all treatment conditions, WAS exhibited shear -thinning behaviour at 
despi te elevated TH temperatures. The flow behaviour of the sludge was best described by the Herschel -
Bulkley model for untreated sludge, sludge during TH, and cooled, treated sludge. The impact of treatment 
temperature, duration of treatment, and sludge concen tration on η∞, k, and σc was described by linear, 
logarithmic, and power -law relationships, respectively. The power -law relationship between sludge 
concentration and rheological parameters was valid for untreated in -situ, and post -thermally treated 
sludge. Therefore, the impact of increasing sludge concentrations is not diminished during TH, despite the 
elevated treatment conditions. However, increasing sludge concentrations did not impact the extent of 
sludge solubilization since the extent of rheol ogical changes due TH were largely constant across the 
different sludge concentrations. This means the actions governing the intensification of viscous forces due 
to increasing sludge concentrations is unchanged at elevated TH conditions. Then, reduction o f these 
forces due to TH is primarily a result of solubilization of the structural components in sludge (e.g. sludge 
flocs and EPS). This is indicated by the linear correlation between the reduction of rheological parameters 
and increase in soluble COD con tent of sludge, suggesting rheological changes due to TH were primarily a 
result of sludge solubilization.

 6.1 ABSTRACT  
Dynamic measurements were performed to describe the viscoelasti c properties of thickened raw and 
thermally hydrolysed waste activated sludge (WAS). Amplitude sweep results revealed gel -like 
characteristics in both the raw and thermally treated sludges; the storage modulus ( G’) was greater than 
loss modulus ( G”).  Due to thermal hydrolysis (TH), G’ and G” decreased linearly with TH temperature. 
This suggests thermally treated sludge structure was increasingly weakened, as reflected by linear 
proportionality between G’ and G” with values of energy of cohesion, E c. Freque ncy and creep response 
of the sludge were described using a fractional derivatives Kelvin -Voigt model (FKV), which had not 
previously been attempted for thermally hydrolysed sludge. The FKV model parameters revealed 
increasingly viscous characteristics in the treated sludge. Results obtained from oscillatory measurements 
can also approximate steady -shear behaviour by comparing dynamic viscosity, η’(ω), and steady -shear 
viscosity, η(γ̇), whose values were very similar. This enables convenient estimation of steady -shear 
behaviour of sludge from oscillatory measurments which is found to be a non -destructive technique for 
measurning flow behaviour of highly concentrated sludge. Yield stress  can also be predicted from the 
product of modified Cox -Merz shift factors and storage modulus ( G’).  
 
6.2 INTRODUCTION  
Thermal hydrolysis (TH) is a processing technique involving usage of high temperatures (100 – 200 °C) to 
achieve desirable physical or c hemical changes in wastewater sludge. One major application is in 
anaerobic digestion, where TH is used as pre -treatment to overcome the rate -limiting hydrolysis step, 
showing favourable results and successful industrial -scale application (Barber, 2016; Ca rrère et al., 2010; 
Sapkaite et al., 2017; Zhen et al., 2017) . In these processes, particulate organic matter is solubilized 
throu gh application of heat for a defined period. This disintegrates cellular material to release organic 
compounds, which impro ves  microorganism access to them, thus enhancing anaerobic digestion 
performance (Ariunbaatar et a l., 2014; Suárez -Iglesias et al., 2017) . Besides that, TH leads to advantageous 
rheological enhancements. For example, the viscosi ty of thermally -treated sludge is greatly reduced, 
which improves the efficiency of pumping, mixing, heating, digester load ing, and sludge dewaterability 
(Farno et al., 2017; Morgan -Sagastume et al., 2011; Pérez -Elvira et al., 2008; Pérez -Elvira and Fdz -Polanco, 
2012;  Zhou et al., 2013) . Rheology plays an important role in the design and operation of sludge handling 
systems (Dentel, 1997; Eshtiaghi et al., 2013) . Despite ex tensive research on sludge TH, detailed studies  
162 
 related to its rheology are scarce (Barber, 2016) . Accordingly, detailed rheological characterization of 
sludge and its viscoelastic properties are of interest and can lead to better implementation of TH 
processes.  
Waste activated sludge (WAS) is the main sludge -type handled in TH processes; its rheology at ambient 
conditions has been well researched (Eshtiaghi et al., 2013; Ratkovich et al., 2013) . WAS rheology is 
generally accepted to behave as a non -Newtonian, shear -thinning fluid, commonly described by the 
Herschel -Bulkley model. It exhibits thixotropic properties (Guibaud et al., 2004)  and many studies 
identified the presen ce of yield stress (Farno et al., 2015; Markis et al., 20 14; Ratkovich et al., 2013) . 
Besides, WAS exhibits viscoelasticity, meaning that it initially shows solid -like behaviour under str ess but 
liquid -like behaviour upon breakdown of floc structure.  
A few studies have characterized viscoelastic properties o f sludge. Ayol et al (2006)  performed dynamic 
measurements on an aerobically digested sludge conditioned with acrylamide polymers and showed that 
storage modulus ( G’) was greater than loss  modulus ( G”) in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region. However, 
this did not consider unconditioned WAS. Baudez et al. (2011)  similarly identified linear viscoelas tic 
behaviour of digested sludge at low stresses. Elastic and loss moduli were constant in the LVE range with 
G’>G”  but G” reaches a peak value at the cross -over strain. Then G’<G” , which was identified as being a 
feature of soft -glassy materials. Yuan and Wang (2013)  and Yuan et al. (2017)  identified solid -like 
characteristics in ra w WAS (54 g/L TSS) where G’>G” . This was s till valid even after extraction of 
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the sludge. However, these studies were limited to low WAS 
concentrations.  
Viscoelastic properties have been reported for thermally treated WAS. Generally, G’ and G” reduced as a 
result of TH, and G’>G” (Farno et al., 2016a; Feng et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2017) , although some studies 
also suggest G”>G’ at low concentrations (< 0.8 wt%) (Feng et al., 2014a, 2014b) . However, Feng et a l. 
(2014a)  and Feng et al. (2014b)  did not examine the impact of varying treatment temperature whereas 
Farno et al. (2016b)  was related to low temperature (50 – 80 °C) thermal sludge processing. Zhang et al. 
(2017)  character ized the visc oelastic properties of WAS (14.2 and 18.2 wt%) after low (60 – 90 °C) and 
high temperature (120 – 180 °C) TH. A Kay -Bernstein -Kearsley -Zappa (KBKZ) model described the 
viscoelastic properties. However, their study was concerned with polyacryla mide (PAM) conditioned 
sludge, which alters flocculation and network structure (Chen et al., 2005) . Furthermore, Farno et al. (2018)  
have shown that a fractional derivatives Kelvin -Voigt model was more representative for sludge  
163 
 viscoelasticity but was limited to lower thermal treatment tempera tures (<80 °C) and sl udge 
concentrations (<6.1 wt%).  
The current study investigates the viscoelastic properties of the raw and thermally -treated WAS. The 
results from viscoelastic measurements are fitted to a fractional derivates Kelvin -Voigt model, which has 
not been attempted before for high -temperature thermally treated sludge. Finally, the adaptability of 
dynamic measurements to obtaining steady shear data is evaluated, assessing its potential for overcoming 
the practical challenges related to the stead y shear flow measurement of highly concentred sludge.  
 
6.3 MATERIALS AND ME THODS  
6.3.1 WASTE ACTIVATE D SLUDGE  
Samples of  WAS were collected at initial  solids concentration 3.5 wt.% from Mount Martha wastewater 
treatment plant in Victoria, Australia, where dissolved air flotation without polymer dosing is used to 
thickened sludge.  The sludge was stored at 4 °C for 30 days before use to ensure minimal changes due to 
biological activity during experiments, and to help maintain the stability and consistency bet ween samples 
(Curvers et al., 2009) . To achieve different concentrations , sludge was first thickened  via centrifugation at 
9000 rpm (13,700 G). Then it was diluted to 7, 9, and 13 wt% by mixing the centrifuged sludge with the 
original sludge . Total solids concentration (wt%) was determined gravimetrically by drying samples to 
constant mass at 105 °C (APHA, 1992) . 
 
6.3.2 OSCILLATROY VI SCOELASTIC MEASUREME NT 
In-situ measurements produced unreliable results when using the pressure cell in dynamic mode. This 
was likely caused by high inertial forces produced  in the bob, which connects to the rheometer via 
magnetic coupling. Therefore, viscoelastic analysis  was carrie d out using parallel plate geometry (40 mm 
diameter, 1 mm gap, 25 °C) on untreated and post -thermal treatment sludge ( 7, 9 and 12 wt%). Strain 
sweep tests were performed  at 10 rad/s. Frequency sweep tests were performed  at angular frequency 
range 1 – 100 r ad/s at constant 0.1% strain, which was within the linear viscoelastic region (LVE) for all 
samples tested. Creep tests were performed by applying step  stress and recording the strain  over 180 s. 
Flow curves were also generated,  and stress ramps were  perfo rmed  to determine the static yield stress 
of samples via the tangent cross -over method (Farno et al., 2016a; Mezger, 2006) . Prior to  each  
164 
 measurement, samples were pre -sheared at 1000 s-1 for 5 mins followed by 2 minutes equilibration at 
rest. Parallel plates were lined with sandpaper (400 grit) to eliminate slippage, and thermally treated 
samples were obtained using a separate 100 mL reactor (Parr Instrument Company). Rheometer raw data 
for oscillatory measurements are published in (Hii and Esht iaghi, 2018) . 
 
6.3.3 VISCOELASTIC M ODELLING  
A fractional derivatives Kelvin -Voigt (FKV) model was fitted to viscoelastic data to allow calculation of 
viscoelastic parameters. This model has so far been used to describe thermally treated sludge, but only 
at low treatment temperatures below 80 °C (Farno et al., 2018) : 
𝜎𝑡(𝑡)= 𝐸1𝜏1𝛼𝑑𝛼𝛾(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡𝛼+𝐸2𝛾(𝑡)   ,   0<𝛼<1 (𝐸𝑞.6.1) 
where  σ (Pa) is stress, γ (-) is strain ; E1 (Pa.sα) and α are cons tants related to the fractional  element, and 
τ1 is the corresponding characteristic time; E2 (Pa) is the spring constant representing the elastic 
element. In this system, G’ and G” moduli are related to frequency, ω (rad/s), as:  
𝐺′(𝜛)= 𝐸1𝜛𝛼cos(𝜋
2𝛼)+𝐸2 (𝐸𝑞.6.2) 
𝐺"(𝜛)= 𝐸1𝜛𝛼sin(𝜋
2𝛼) (𝐸𝑞.6.3) 
The strain response  to step stress is given (Schiessel et al., 199 5): 
𝛾(𝑡)= 𝜎
𝐸(1−𝐸𝛼(−(𝑡
𝜏)𝛼
)) (𝐸𝑞.6.4) 
where  Eα is a generalized  Mittag -Leffler function of order α; E = E 1(τ1/ τ)α; τ = (E 1 τ1α/E2)1/α. Experimental 
data were fitted to the FKV models via MATLAB, using the non-linear  least squares function. The Mittag -
Leffler function was evaluated using MATLAB protocols extracted from (Garrappa, 2015) .  
 
6.4 RESULTS AND DISC USSION  
6.4.1 VISCOELASTIC B EHAVIOUR  
Strain sweep results (Figure 6.1) compare deformation behaviour before and after TH, as well as changes 
in G’ and G” moduli. For both untreated and thermally treat ed samples, WAS exhibited linear viscoelastic 
deformation at low strain values with G’>G”, indicating gel -like behaviour. Then, with increasing strain the 
rate of change in G’ and G” became increasingly strain -dependent, where both moduli decreased rapidly  
165 
 until a crossover point was reached, then G”>G’. The viscous characteristics of the sludge are then 
dominant, and sludge exhibits irreversible deformation, or flow. This general beh aviour was observed for 
all concentrations (7 – 12 wt%) of untreated and thermally treated (100 – 140 °C) WAS examined. These 
results are consistent with those reported in Farno et al. (2016b ) and Zhang et al. (2017 ) for different 
sludge concen trations and treatment conditions. Interestingly, the abovementioned studies reported 
presence of a G”-peak, which was largely absent in the current study. Instead, the G”-curves for all 
untreated and thermally treated sludge transitioned smoothly into the  viscous region without rising above 
its plateau values. This difference compared to Farno et al. (2016b)  is likely due to the higher sludge 
concentrations used in the current study as compared to theirs (3.5 – 6.1 wt%). On the other hand, the 
sludge  used by Zhang et al. (2017)  had higher concentration(14.2 and 18.2 wt%) but was conditioned with 
PAM, which significantly affects its network structure (Wang et al., 2017) .  
In those studies, the G” curve first rises to a local maximum near the cross -over point before decreasing 
smoothly with increasing strain. This phenomenon was attributed to be a feature of soft -glassy materials 
and was believed to be an indication of the breakdown of the sludge’s internal structure. Essentially, G” 
represented the non -recoverable deformation ene rgy. Then, at increasing strain values beyond the LVE 
range, the rising G” curve could be interpreted as the gradual collapse in the network structure of the 
sludge which was initially present at rest (Mezger, 2006) . Furthermore, it was  reported in both studies 
that the height of the G”-peak was reduced by thermal treatment.  
However, in the current study, this phenomenon was not pronounced.  In the case of thermally treated 
sludge, only a small rise in the G” curve was observed in the flo w transition range of strain. This increasing 
G” only becomes apparent when presented on a linear -log scale, as shown in figure 6.1(b). Still, the peak 
G” value for all cases of untreated sludge was no more than 10% greater than its plateau values in the L VE 
region, whereas in Farno et al. (2016b) , this was upwards of 40% for thermally treated sludge. One 
possible reason is that the sludge used in the current study was of a much higher solids concentration. In 
the case of Farno et al. (2016b) , the sludge used in their study was more dilute (3.5 – 6.1 wt%), meaning 
that the fraction of  continuous medium (sludge liquor) was greater. This possibly allowed the dispersed 
phase (sludge flocs) to be distributed further apart. It has been shown that WAS is composed of 
filamentous material, besides EPS and bacteria (Koivuranta et al., 2015; Perez et al., 2006) , which serve as 
the “backbone” of the microbial flocs (Jenkins et al., 2003) . Then, the filaments may become more readily 
entangled due to the larger  inter -particle spaces between flocs, forming a gel network. Therefore, as the  
166 
 sludge is deformed beyond the LVE region, this disentangling gel -network would be detected as a rising 
G” curve.  
On the other hand, sludge used in the current study has higher solids content exhibiting a pasty 
appearance – especially for 12% untreated sample. This means the sludge flocs are likely to be more tightly 
packed together and the filamentous substances may not be as free to entangle in the continuous medium. 
Thus, as t he sludge is deformed, the particles in the sludge are likely just sliding past one another, such as 
in the case of simple thickened particle suspension systems. In this case, the loss of deformation energy 
due to the gradual breakage of the sludge network  may be comparatively undetectable. Then, the rising 
G”-curve is not observed.  
In the case of thermally treated sludge, the network structure has been largely destroyed due to 
solubilization of flocs and sludge particulates. Therefore, some network struct ure still remains, while the 
particles and flocs are also able to flow more freely due to their reduced size. Then, the dissipation of 
energy due to breakage of sludge network during deformation is detectable, but small due to an already 
weakened network.  In the case of Zhang et al. (2017) , highly concentrated sludges (14.2 and 18.2 wt%) 
was studied but they also detected the presence of a G” -peak. However, it is n oted that in their study the 
sludge samples have been conditioned with PAM which is a flocculant used to form network structures 
within the sludge (Chen et al., 2005) . Therefore, breakag e of the PAM network during deformation beyond 
the LVE range may have contributed to the G” -peaks observed in their study.  
Although gel -like characteristic (G’>G”) was present in all samples of untreated and thermally treated 
sludge, treated samples showe d larger portions of viscous deformation. This is indicated by higher G” 
values in the LVE region. Figure 6.2 compares the loss factor (tanδ = G”/G’) for untreated and thermally 
treated samples. Increasing tan δ values indicate a higher portion of non -recov erable deformation energy. 
Generally, tan δ increased with treatment temperature but reduced with sludge concentration. This 
means sludge exhibited more elastic characteristics with sludge concentration, but this becomes 
diminished due to TH. At increasing sludge concentrations, interactions between the sludge particles and 
its gel -like network are strengthened (Markis et al., 2016) , resulting in the observed higher elastic 
properties. But as a result of TH, the polymeric network structures are destroyed due to solubilization of 
sludge components. Then, the increasing tan δ suggests a greater extent of network destruction occurred 
at higher treatment temperatures.

Figure 6. 2 – Loss factor, tan δ = G”/G’, for untreated and thermally treated WAS in the LVE region (<1% 
strain) measured at 25 °C, 10 rad/s.  
 
The critical strain values, γ c (%), of the LVE region remain largely unchanged for all untreated and thermally 
treated sludge samples, regardless  of treatment temperature. Here, γ c was defined as the strain value at 
which G’ deviated by at least 5% compared its previous measuring point at decreasing strain (i.e. when G’ 
deviates significantly from the plateau LVE values; refer Figure 6.1a). In most  cases, γ c was 6 – 12% strain, 
below which the sludge showed LVE behaviour. No discernible pattern was observed between γ c and TH 
conditions or sludge concentration. This is consistent with (Mori et al., 2006)  who reported that critical 
strain values largely remained constant for different concentrations of WAS (2.7 – 5.7 wt% total 
suspended solids) and was independent of sludge concentration.  
Shrinkage of the LVE region due to TH (170 °C, 60 min) has been rep orted in treated sludge (Feng  et al., 
2014b) . This was indicated by a reduction in the crossover strain value, γ f, (where G’ = G”). A similar 
observation was made in the current study for 7 wt% and 9 wt% sludge, where γ f was reduced after TH. 
Here, a “yielding range of strain” can be defined: γy = γ f – γc, which describes the size of the strain values 
for which sludge begins to exhibit irreversible deformation, but the gel -like behaviour still exists. Figure 
6.3 shows the reduction in γy is linearly correlated with increasing treatm ent temperature, which reflects 
 
169 
 the temperature -dependent solubilization of the gel network. Thus, thermally treated sludge was less able 
to recover deformation energy, hence flowed more readily at the lower strain. Accordingly, a value 
representing the en ergy of cohesion of the three -dimensional network of the sludge, E c (J/mol), can be 
calculated (Mori et al., 2 006) : 
𝐸𝑐=1
2𝜎𝑐𝛾𝑐 (12) 
Here, γc (%) is the critical strain value as previously defined, and σc (Pa) is the corresponding critical stress. 
As shown in Figure 6.3a, Ec is reduced with treatment temperature, indicating a reduction in the degree 
of inter particle interaction and strength of flocs. Furthermore, G’ and G” also decreased linearly with 
treatment temperature and showed linear proportionality with Ec (Figure 6.3a and b), which affirms the 
decrease in sludge’s deformation resistance is due to the  breakdown of structural integrity.  
G’ and G” exhibited minor frequency dependence in the LVE region, showing slight increase with angular 
velocity, as seen in Figure 6.4. Across the whole frequency range, G’>G” for all concentrations of sludge, 
regardless of thermal treatment. The moduli do not cross over at any point in the range of frequencies 
examined. In fact, the loss factor ( tanδ  = G”/G’) largely remained constant. This behaviour is characteristic 
of weak gels (Rao and Cooley, 1992)  and reflects the presence of biopolymers in sludge. This means in the 
LVE range, sludge exhibited physical network structure (Mezger, 2006) , which remained relatively 
constant  in the entire frequency range. Due to TH, the gel network of biopolymers is deteriorated which 
leads to reduction in G’ and G” (Figure 6.3a), but a gel network remained, regardless.  
Zhang et al. (2017)  used KBKZ to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of thermally treated sludge. However, 
Farno et al. (2018)  showed the FKV model can be more realistic and accurate due to the fractional element 
in the model, which describes the intermediate characteristics between purely viscous and purely elastic 
elements. Here, frequency  sweep results could be very well described by the FKV model (Equations 6.2 
and 6.3), with fitting curves predicting experimental data shown as continuous lines in Figure 6.4. The 
corresponding fitting parameters, as well as fitting error, are presented in  Table 6.1.

E1 and E2 are model constants representing responses of the fractional and elastic elements in Equation 
6.1, respectively. It was described for biological soft tissues (Nicolle et al., 2010)  that the fractional portion 
was analogous to the gel -like behaviour of the filamentous cytoskeleton inside cellular material, whereas 
the elastic portion represented the elastic r esponse of permanent structures such as the cell wall. Both  E1 
and E2 linearly decreased with treatment temperature, except for 12 wt% untreated sludge (25 °C). In the 
case of 12 wt% untreated sludge, E1 was inconsistently low, and E2 was exceedingly high.  On one hand, 
this may be an indication that untreated 12% sludge behaviour could be predominantly described as an 
elastic solid than a weak gel compared to other sludge. This is plausible as the untreated 12% sludge 
sample exhibited a thicker, paste -like appearance as opposed the other less concentrated and thermally 
treated samples. On the other hand, the inconsistent values observed for 12% untreated sample may also 
be a result of unsuitability of the current measurement methods being adopted for higher concentrations 
of untreated WAS, since it was observed that this sample tended to exhibit signs bifurcation and edge 
effects during repeated measurements.  Indeed, thickened sludge types (15 – 30 wt%) have been 
considered as soft solids, rather than weak g els. (Baudez et al., 2016) . However, for all other sludge 
samples the linear reduction of E1 and E2 with treatment temperature indicate weakening of sludges’ 
structural strength after TH. Furthermore, α also increased linearly with treatment temperature. This 
means the sludge exhibited higher viscous characteristics after TH since Equation 6.1 reduces t o the 
classical Kelvin -Voigt model when α = 1 (Farno et al., 2018) .

The creep data and FKV model fitting are presented by markers and continuous lines in Figure 6.5, 
respectively. Fitting parameters of the model (Equation 6.4) are presented in Table 6.2. Similar to Farno 
et al. (2018) , α was obtained from fitting of the FKV model (Equation 6.2 and 6.3) to frequency sweep data 
(listed in Table 6.1). This was described as an advantage of the FKV model over classical Kelvin -Voigt model 
since α is not an arbitrarily derived value, but derived from frequency sweep results, reducin g the number 
 
173 
 of unknown parameters in Equation 6.4 to two and improving reliability of the FKV model fitting. Another 
advantage of the FKV model is that it features a single τ value, as opposed to other models which consider 
a spectrum of τ values, such as  the generalized Kelvin -Voigt model or the KBKZ model (Zhang et al., 2017) . 
This becomes useful in process design cases; for example, in mixing of viscoelastic fluids, where relevant 
equations require dis crete τ values (Xu et al., 2018) . 
Increasing treatment temperature, E is reduced for all concentrations of sludge, indicating lower strain 
resistance. The respondence time, τ (s), does not exhibit any apparent relationship with treatment 
temperature but for all samples, were large. This reveals highly viscoelastic behaviour in sludge as a long  
time is required to reach its final deformation at given input stress. As described for the Kelvin -Voigt model, 
τ is infinite for purely viscoelastic materials by definition, and zero for purely elastic materials, whereas it 
is undefined for purely viscou s materials since they do not exhibit strain (Tschoegl, 2012) . As shown in 
Figure 6.5, the FKV model can adequately describe the viscoelastic characteristics of ther mally treated 
sludge  (error values for fitting presented in Table 6.2). However, 12 wt% untreated sludge could not be 
reliably described, likely due to its pasty characteristics as previously speculated. It is recommended that 
further research be done to e xamine more appropriate models for thick, pasty sludges.  
 
6.4.2 EVALUATING STE ADY SHEAR FLOW PARAM ETERS FROM OSCILLATO RY 
MEASUREMENTS  
It was of interest whether viscoelastic data could approximate steady -shear flow properties of sludge. 
Such correlation wo uld be useful in applications where steady -shear measurements are not readily 
producible. For example, online process rheometers which operate by dynamic measurements 
(Konigsberg et al., 2013) . Besides that, it was ob served in the current study that steady -shear 
measurements of thickened WAS (12 wt% untreated) tended to exhibit edge effects and bifurcation 
phenomena. The challenges associated with rheological measurement of highly concentrated sludge are 
highlighted in  many works (Baudez  et al., 2016; Mouzaoui et al., 2018) . Potentially, such issues could be 
overcome by approximating steady -shear properties from dynamic measurements since it produces low 
sample strains.  
As described by Cox -Merz analogy, η*(ω) = η(γ̇)|ω =γ̇ where η* is the complex viscosity (Pa.s) and ω is the 
angular velocity (rad/s), from dynamic measurements, whereas η is the steady -shear apparent viscosity 
(Pa.s) and γ̇ is the shear rate (s-1), from rotational measurements. Traditionally, Cox -Merz analogy is not  
174 
 appl icable for dispersion systems (e.g. sludge). However, a modified Cox -Merz rule was applied to 
correlate complex viscosity  (η*) and dynamic viscosity  (η’) to steady -shear viscosity of semi -solid foods 
(Bistany and Kokini, 1983) : 
𝜂∗,𝜂′(𝜔)=𝐶[𝜂(𝛾̇)]𝑠(𝐸𝑞.6.5) 
According to Equation 6.5, the plot of η(γ̇) is effectively shifted until it superimposed with the plot of η*(ω) 
or η’(ω). This modified Cox -Merz rule was applied to the untreated and thermally tre ated sludge here, 
based on measurements employing parallel plate geometry. As shown in Figure 6. 6 (a), η*(ω) does not 
readily superimpose with the unshifted η(γ̇) curve. This confirms traditional Cox -Merz analogy is not valid, 
even for thermally -treated sl udge. Interestingly, the η’(ω) plot closely resembled the η(γ̇) plot even 
without shifting, as shown in Figure 6. 6 (b). The dynamic viscosity, η'(ω), describes the real portion of the 
complex viscosity (i.e. η* = η’ – iη”) and represents the energy lost du ring deformation.  
Table 6.3 shows shift factors for Equation 6.5, as well as error between the steady -shear and oscillatory 
values after shifting. Besides that, the error between the unshifted η(γ̇) and η’(ω) curves are also shown. 
Notably, the s-values ne arly equal 1 in all cases. This means the curve trends for η*(ω), η’(ω), and η(γ̇) 
were already initially very similar. Then, a simple vertical or horizontal shift can reliably superimpose η(γ̇) 
to the η*(ω) and η’(ω) curves. On the other hand, C-values showed that unshifted η*(ω) values were at 
least 5 times greater than η(γ̇) in all cases, but η’(ω) and η(γ̇) were nearly equal. The C-values did not show 
a clear relationship with the sludge concentration or treatment  temperature, but generally decreased 
with temperature and increased with concentration. This suggests that the pastier samples tend to show 
greater deviation between their oscillatory and steady shear viscosity values.  
Since the shift factor  values corres ponding to η’(ω) were very close to 1 in all cases, this suggests  the 
following, based on the correlation by Spriggs et al. (1966) : 
𝜂′(𝜔)≈𝜂(𝛾̇)|𝛾̇= 𝜔 (𝐸𝑞.6.6)  
Equation 6.6 Error values for this approximation are in the range of 9 – 20% for thermally tr eated samples 
(Table 6.3). For untreated sludge, this error increased likely due to bifurcation and edge effect phenomena. 
Possibly, the higher error values are likely due to inherent flaws of the steady shear method, since dynamic 
measurement did not exhi bit abovementioned phenomena. This was especially apparent in 12 wt% sludge 
which exhibited obvious sample fractures and edge effects during repeated steady -shear measurements, 
as reflected by inconsistently high error value and shift factors.   
175 
 From a prac tical standpoint , Equation 6.6 allows quick, simple approximation of sludge’s steady -shear 
viscosity using frequency sweep data. Sludge’s shear -thinning behaviour can also be determined from 
either η*(ω) or η’(ω) since they followed nearly ident ical curve trends with η(γ̇). If a single η(γ̇) value can 
be determined, then the η(γ̇) curve over a range of shear rates can be predicted. Alternatively, shift factors 
in Table 6.3 can be used to transform η*(ω) or η’(ω) plots from frequency sweep tests to produce η(γ̇) 
plots. Shift factor values for intermediate conditions between those presented in Table 6.3 may also be 
interpolated. Along with Equations 5.1 – 5.3, the above observations allow process monitoring in TH using 
either steady -shear or dynamic measurements in real time. Furthermore, it offers potential application in 
qualitative determination of flow properties of thicker sludge using non -destructive oscillatory methods.   
 
Table 6. 3 – Empirical shift factors for Cox -Merz rule  
 
Equation 6.5 imposes a vertical shift of the viscosity plots. However, a horizontal shift is also valid here 
since the s-values in Table 6.3 nearly equal to 1. Then, a linear relationship exists between η*(ω) and η(γ̇), 
and it can be written: η*(H x ω) = η(γ̇)|γ̇= ω, where H is a horizontal shift factor applied to superimpose 
both curves. This horizontal shift factor, H, has been used to derive the yield stress of concentrated, non -
Newtonian suspensions (Canet et al., 2005) . This was achieved by multiplying H with G’ at the critical strain.  
In the current study, a better approximation of yield stress was obtained by multiplying H with the plateau 
G’ (obtained from st rain sweep results, as in Figure 6.1). The yield stress values derived from G’ x H are 
compared against those derived from flow curve fitting (dynamic yield stress), as well as direct 
measurement (static yield stress) in Table 6.4. Notably, the G’ x H values come very close to approximating   η*(ω) = C[η(γ̇)] s|γ̇= ω η'(ω) = C’[η(γ̇)] s’|γ̇= ω η'(ω) = η(γ̇)|γ̇= ω

 6.5 CONCLUSION  
Thermally treated and untreated sludges exhibited gel -like viscoelastic behaviour in low strain values 
(<12%). The frequency dependence of the storage ( G’) and loss ( G”) moduli were well described by the 
FKV viscoelastic model, as well as the strain response to a step stress during creep. The FKV model 
parameters ( E1, E2, and α) revealed that the viscoelastic properties of thermally treated sludges were 
increasingly described by viscous characteristics at high er treatment temperatures, which suggests the 
destruction of structural components in the sludge, such as polymeric substances and EPS due to 
solubilization. This is reflected in the decreasing energy of cohesion values, Ec, which describe the strength 
of the three -dimensional sludge network. Strain sweep results did not exhibit a rising G” value near critical 
strain values in the G” curve, suggesting that the deformation behaviour thicker sludges may be closer to 
simple thick suspension systems than soft -glassy materials, as in dilute sludges. The dynamic rheological 
measurements are adaptable to describing steady shear results using a modified Cox -Merz rule. Since the 
curve trends for complex and dynamic viscosity are virtually identical, a simple horizont al shift factor can 
superimpose the two curves. On the other hand, the dynamic viscosity can approximate steady shear 
viscosity (to within 20% error) for thermally treated sludges without shifting. On the other hand, 
horizontal shift factors for superimpos ing complex viscosity and steady shear viscosity curves can be used 
to approximate yield stress values of the sludge to within the same order of magnitude as compared to 
yield stress values obtained by other methods. These open up more alternative options for in situ 
monitoring of TH processes via different rheometric techniques. From a practical viewpoint , the above 
outcomes mean that TH sludge should not be handled as a Newtonian material. This is especially the case 
as process parameters tend t owards thicker sludge types and more economically desirable moderate TH 
temperatures. As sludge exhibited yield stress and viscoelastic properties at rest, appropriate 
consideration should be taken in the design and operation of TH processes as these rheol ogical properties 
can affect the mixing, heating, and pumping performance, and subsequently cost of these processes.

 7.1 INTRODUCTION  
Hydrothermal processing markedly alters the rheology of waste activated sludge (WAS). Compared to 
untreated sludge, the high -shear viscosity (600s-1) and yield stress of thermally treated sludge at 25 °C 
was 14 -72% and 9 -60% of their original values at 25 °C (Figure 4.3), respectively, depending on treatment 
temperature within the range of 80 -140°C. The G’ and G” of treated sludge were also 8 -39% and 13-50% 
their original values (Figure 6.3), respectively, for the range of temperatures studied. These rheological 
parameters would decrease even further in situ at treatment temperature, as previously shown by 
equations 5.5 and 5.6. Indeed, the pronounced rheological changes demonstrated in the preceding 
chapters highlight the significance of considering rheological parameters as a part of the efficient design 
and operation of high -temperature sludge -handling processes. It also reveals areas for optimizatio n in 
hydrothermal processing in sludge treatment systems. For example, studies on the energy balance around 
TH systems have shown that hydrothermal processing of sludge is a net positive energy process (Barber, 
2016; Pilli et al., 2015), even without consi dering additional savings which could be achieved in the 
ancillary processes, such as mixers and pumps, due to sludge rheological enhancements. This chapter 
explores some practical implications of the findings in this thesis and their significance for engi neering 
applications.  
 
7.2 DISCUSSION  
The results from this thesis can be applied to several practical engineering applications. A few note -worthy 
areas are explored below with examples.  These include applications in pump d esign, heat exchanger 
design , process monitoring, the impact of sludge concentration and its viscoelastic properties, and the 
potential research implications for using oscillatory rheological measurements to approximate steady -
shear measurements.  
 
7.2.1 PUMP  DESIGN  
In pumping operations , the frictional head losses are dependent upon sludge viscosity and yield stress 
(Anderson et al., 2008). Then, the reduction of yield stress and viscosity due to thermal treatment of 
sludge can lead to reduced pumping cost (Farno et al., 2017). The sludg e yield stress is used in the 
Reynolds -3 friction loss model to determine the transition pipe flow velocity from laminar to turbulent 
(Slatter, 2008). These rheological parameters that are of high significance for sizing pump power, can be 
acquired using t he equations presented in this study. For example, given a thermal hydrolysis (TH) pre - 
184 
 treatment process (130 °C and 60 minutes) treating waste activated sludge (WAS) of 10 wt% solids content, 
the frictional head losses for pumping incoming (feed) and exit ing (thermally treated) sludge from the TH 
reactor can be estimated. Assumptions for this calculation is presented in Table 7.1:  
Table 7. 1 – Example parameters for calculating pump requirements.

Pipe length  100 m  100 m  
 
Since sludge is relatively thickened, settling is unlikely to occur; laminar pipe flow is reasonable for 
pumping thickened sludge (Anderson et al., 2008) . Furthermore, Herschel -Bulkley fluids are seldom 
operated in turbulent regime owing to high pressure drops  which subsequently results in high pumping 
power (Swamee and Aggarwal, 2011) . Then, the critica l velocity for onset of transition to turbulent flow 
region can be determined using the proposed Reynolds -3 friction loss model as follows (Slatter, 2008) : 
𝑅𝑒3= 8𝜌𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛2
(𝜎𝑐+𝑘(8𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛
𝐷𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟)𝑛
)(𝐸𝑞.7.1) 
Where ρ (kg/m3) is the sludge density, Vann (m/s) is the sludge annular velocity, Dshear (m) is the diameter 
of the sheared -zone of the fluid, σc (Pa), k (Pa.sn) and n (-) are the Herschel -Bulkley parameters, yields 
stres s consistency index and flow index. It is assumed that transitional pipe flow occurs at Re 3 = 2100 
similar to thickened mineral slurries. To solve Eq. 7.1, the Herschel -Bulkley parameters for the incoming 
and exiting sludge must be determined.  
For incoming  sludge (10 wt%, untreated, 25 °C), σc and k can be approximated using the master curve 
parameters (Figure 5.2, Tables A.5 -1 and A.5 -2) and equations 4.6 and 4.7. Firstly, master curve shift 
factors S y and S x were determined for 9 wt% sludge as the closest  approximation. From Table A.5 -1, 130 °C 
untreated, 9 wt%, S y=0.96; from Table A.5 -2, 130 °C untreated, 9 wt%, S x=0.78. Then, from equations 4.6 
and 4.7:  
𝑘=19.97(0.86
0.610.4)=20.9 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛  
185 
 𝜎𝑐=81.33∗0.86=69.9 𝑃𝑎 
Alternatively, using the power -law relati onship with solids concentration for untreated sludge (Figure 
S.5.6), the k and σc of 10 wt% untreated sludge can be approximated:  
𝑘0=8555(0.1)2.5=27.1 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛 
𝜎𝑐,0=113469(0.1)3.1=90.1 𝑃𝑎 
Then, to obtain the critical velocity which transition happens in pipe flow Re 3 can be used,  
𝑅𝑒3=2100= 8∗1015∗𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛2
90.1+27.1(8∗𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛
𝐷𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟)0.4 
Detailed steps for solving Re 3 is presented in Appendix 7.1, but for Re 3 = 2100, the following parameters 
are true:  
𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛=10.43 𝑚
𝑠 
𝐷𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟=0.16 𝑚 
𝑉𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙=10.62 𝑚
𝑠 
The critical velocity for transitional pipe flow of 10 wt% WAS at 25 °C is rather high. In practical terms, this 
means the thickened raw WAS is unlikely to reach transitional or turbulent flow at the given pipe diameter 
(200 mm) under common sludge pumping velocities of around 4 m/s (Anderson et al., 2008) . This is 
reas onable given the pasty nature of thickened WAS.  
For the exiting sludge, post -thermal  treatment it is assumed the sludge concentration remains unchanged. 
Then, σc and k can be determined using Eq. 5.2 and Eq. 5.3:  
  𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−𝐴2(130)−𝐵2ln(60)+𝐶2 
Here, k7,0 = 9.86 Pa was determined using the master curve, following the procedures described above, 
for untreated sludge at 25 °C with 7 wt% solids concentration.  
A2, B2, and C 2 are determined for 10 wt% WAS using Eq. 5.4:  
𝐴2=5 × 0.12.6𝐴2=5 × 0.12.6=0.0126   
186 
 𝐵2=50 × 0.12.8=0.079 
𝐶2=975 × 0.12.6=2.45 
Then,  
𝑘𝑖9.86⁄=0.49 
Then ki = 4.83 Pa was calculated.  
Similarly, σc is determined:  
𝜎𝑐,𝑖𝜎𝑐7,0⁄=−𝐴3(130)−𝐵3ln(60)+𝐶3 
Such that σc = 2.19 Pa. Then, solving for Re3, the velocity for transitional pipe flow is determined (example 
calculations in Appendix 7.1):  
𝑉𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙=3.05𝑚
𝑠 
This means the critical velocity for transitional pipe flow is reduced to one third of its value compared to 
untreated sludge. Pumping thermally -treated sludge exiting t he TH reactor at velocities greater than 3.05 
m/s may be desirable to assist heat transfer, as well as reduce the likelihood of solids settling in the pipes.  
Subsequently, the pumping requirements for the incoming and exiting sludge to the TH reactor can be 
calculated, given the conditions in Table 7.1.  
For the incoming sludge, since it is quite thickened (10 wt%) and rheological parameters are quite high, 
particle settling is not a likely concern. Then, sludge should be pumped at velocities below V c = 10. 62 m/s 
to maintain laminar flow and reduce head losses.  
For laminar flow of Herschel -Bulkley fluids, pumping power requirements can be determined (Swamee 
and Aggarwal, 2011) : 
𝑃=8𝑓𝐿𝜌
𝜋2𝐷5𝑄3(𝐸𝑞.7.2) 
Where f is the friction factor, L (m) is pipe length, Q (m3/s) is flow rate. The friction factor, f, can be 
calculated from (Swamee and Aggarwal, 2011) :

To maintain laminar flow conditions, assume the incoming sludge is pumped at 5 m/s. Then the following 
parameters are calculated:

For the exiting sludge, it is assumed turbulent conditions are required, so sludge is pumped at V = 5 m/ s 
which is greater than the critical velocity of 3.05 m/s.  
For turbulent conditions, the friction factor can be calculated (Slatter, 2001) :

From above calculations, the pumping power required to transport untreated sludge was 119.58 kW, 
whereas for thermally -treated sludge it was 5.98 kW. Given that the pipe dimensions and velocity were 
kept constant between the two conditions and the only difference was in rheological parameters of the 
sludge, it is apparent that the pumping of thermally -treated sludge was t remendously reduced. As 
demonstrated, these values were determined reliably based on the availability of required rheological 
parameters.  
 
7.2.2 HEAT EXCHANGER  DESIGN  
Typically, it is desirable to utilise high temperature of thermally treated sludge to he at feed sludge as it 
travels between the TH reactor and subsequent anaerobic digester (Pilli et al., 2015). As the treated sludge  
189 
 is cooled across the temperature gradient of the heat -exchange surface, it is reasonable to expect its 
viscosity and yield str ess to increase gradually. For example, the apparent viscosity and yield stress of 
treated WAS at 140 °C was only about 10% its value at 80 °C. Since rheological parameters are related to 
a fluid’s velocity profile and residence time in a heat exchanger (T ucker, 2017), variation in sludge 
rheological parameters due to temperature changes will affect the heat -transfer performance. Then, heat 
exchangers must be designed accordingly to accommodate these variations. The relationships presented 
earlier (e.g. Eq.  5.3) help to estimate correct values of rheological parameters, with respect to 
temperature, useful in design. For example, heat transfer equations for heat transfer coefficients in non -
Newtonian fluids requires values for the fluid viscosity (Peixinho et al., 2008) : 
ℎ𝐷
𝜅=0.0152×(𝜌𝑉𝐷
𝜂𝑤)0.845
×(𝜈
𝜅)1
3(𝐸𝑞.7.10) 
Where h is the heat transfer coefficient (Wm-2K-1), κ is the thermal conductivity o f the fluid (Wm-1°C-1),  ηw 
is the fluid viscosity at the wall (Pa.s), and ν is the kinematic viscosity (m2s-1).  
 
Assuming the same conditions as the example from 7.1.1 of thermally -treated sludge (130 °C, 10 wt%) 
exiting the TH reactor and assuming temperature at the pipe wall to be 120 °C, the apparent viscosity at 
the pipe wall can be determined. Assuming sludge travelling at velocity of 5 m/s, the apparent wall shear -
rate is calculated:  
8𝑉
𝐷=8(5)
0.2=200 𝑠−1 
Then, from figure S5.5 the flow  curve parameters for 10 wt% WAS at 120 °C is determined:  
𝑘𝑖=1808.1(0.1)2.8=2.87 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛 
𝜎𝑐,𝑖=7365(0.1)2.8=11.7 𝑃𝑎 
Then, the flow curve representing the 10 wt% WAS at 120 °C is:  
𝜎=11.7+2.87(𝛾)̇0.4 
The apparent viscosity at the wall is determined:  
𝜎=11.7+2.87(200)0.4=35.6 𝑃𝑎  
190 
 𝜂𝑤=𝜎
𝛾̇=35.6
200=0.18 𝑃𝑎.𝑠 
Then, the heat transfer coefficient can be determined from Eq.7.10:  
Assuming thermal conductivity equal to water, κ = 0.677 Wm-1K-1, 
ℎ(0.2)
(0.677)=0.0152×((1015)(5)(0.2)

3
 
ℎ=4.87𝑊
𝑚2𝐾 
Then, assuming the sludge is cooled to ambient conditions (25 °C) by the end of the heat exchanger, the 
flow curve parameters for the cooled, thermally treated sludge can be determined from Equations 5.5 
and 5.6:  
11.7= 𝜎𝑐,𝑓(−0.0036 (120)+1) 
𝜎𝑐,𝑓=20.6 𝑃𝑎 
2.87= 𝑘𝑓(−0.0055 (120)+1) 
𝑘𝑓=8.44 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛 
Then, the flow curve describing 10 wt% WAS thermally -treated at 120 °C but cooled to 25 °C is:  
𝜎=20.6+8.44(𝛾)̇0.4 
Similarly, the apparent viscosity is determined as above:  
𝜂𝑤=𝜎
𝛾̇=99.2
200=0.5 𝑃𝑎.𝑠 
Then, calculating heat transfer coefficient as described above yields:  
ℎ=2.89𝑊
𝑚2𝐾 
Then, as the sludge cools along the heat exchanger, it becomes increasingly viscous and the heat transfer 
coefficient is similarly reduced.   
191 
 Given the rheological paramet ers of the cooled sludge have changed compared to when it first exited the 
TH reactor, a check for turbulent flow conditions can be performed as previously described for Re 3. 
Assuming sludge still flows at 5 m/s velocity:  
𝑅𝑒3=2064   
Since Re 3 of the cooled thermally -treated sludge is reduced (compared to Re 3 = 4913 for thermally treated 
sludge at 130 °C when exiting the reactor) and less than 2100, there is likelihood it will flow under laminar 
conditions at the exit of the pipe. Using the cal culations above, the pumping velocity can be adjusted to 
achieve the desired flow conditions, as the examples here have demonstrated . 
 
7.2.3 PROCESS PERFOR MANCE MONITORING  
Besides above examples, equations 5.1 -5.4 allow quick estimation of in -situ WAS rheo logy at various 
treatment conditions. Having in -situ WAS rheological parameters is useful in monitoring TH performance). 
Also, as discussed in Chapter 5, the in -situ measurements suggest that sludge concentration does not 
impact the effectiveness of TH, as  the extent and rate of rheological changes was almost equal at different 
concentrations (Figure 5.3 inset). This new information provides engineers with a certain degree of 
flexibility in choosing sludge concentrations for TH, since varying sludge concent ration would not 
negatively impact its solubilization effectiveness. This information is useful when there is a need to vary 
sludge concentration in order to maximize biogas production while also maintain a good heating efficiency 
(Barber, 2016). Furthermo re, as there is minimal rheological changes at treatment times beyond 30 
minutes (Figures S.5.1 – S.5.3) and organic matter solubilisation,  TH treatment time can be optimised to 
reduce heating cost and increase sludge throughput based on observed sludge r heological behaviours and 
its link to solubilisation. In addition, in Chapter 4, a linear relationship was shown between changes of the 
amount of organic matter solubilisation and changes of rheological properties. So, monitoring process 
performance via rh eological properties is possible instead of time consuming and offline measurements 
of the amount of solubilisation of organic matter via COD test.  
An example is presented here for monitoring the performance of TH processes. Given a TH process was 
to be ca rried out at 125 °C on 8 wt% WAS. It was required to optimize the treatment duration by stopping 
the TH treatment once the sludge reaches minimal changes in solubilization. Assume that the untreated 
8 wt% sludge had soluble COD value of sCOD = 3500 mg/L; a nd when diluted to 7 wt% it has high -shear 
apparent viscosity (measured at 600 s-1 shear rate), η∞,0 = 0.3 Pa.s. Then, the extent of solubilization can  
192 
 be estimated by observing the extent of change in the sludge viscosity during TH. It has been shown that  
regardless of sludge concentration, the extent of rheological changes was relatively constant (Chapter 5; 
Tables A.5.4 – A.5.6). Then, equation 4.12 can be used to estimate the extent of viscosity reduction at 
different times during TH.  
Examining treatme nt time of 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 40 min:  
𝜂∞,𝑖
𝜂∞,0=0.92−0.006 (125)−0.026 𝐿𝑛(5)⁄ =0.128 
𝜂∞,𝑖
𝜂∞,0=0.92−0.006 (125)−0.026 𝐿𝑛(10)⁄ =0.110 
𝜂∞,𝑖
𝜂∞,0=0.92−0.006 (125)−0.026 𝐿𝑛(20)⁄ =0.092 
𝜂∞,𝑖
𝜂∞,0=0.92−0.006 (125)−0.026 𝐿𝑛(40)⁄ =0.074 
𝜂∞,𝑖
𝜂∞,0=0.92−0.006 (125)−0.026 𝐿𝑛(60)⁄ =0.064 
Then, the estimated evolution of η∞,i/η∞,0 can be plotted over time (Figure 7.1).  Assuming a cut -off point 
of 3% change in the solubilization of the sludge for efficient process, then from Figure 7.1, it can be seen 
that limiting v alues of apparent viscosity reduction have been reached by 20 minutes treatment time. 
Then, treatment times beyond 20 minutes gave negligible changes which implies suboptimal energy 
efficiency in terms of sludge solubilisation.  
At 20 minutes, the solubilization of COD may be estimated from Figure 4.6:  
𝑟𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷= −2.6(𝜂∞𝜂∞,0⁄)+2.5 
𝑟𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷= −2.6(0.092)+2.5 
𝑟𝑠𝐶𝑂𝐷=2.3 
Then an increase in soluble COD upwards by a factor of 2.3 can be expected due to solubilization at 20 
minutes of 125 °C TH treatm ent.  
193

7.2.4 IMPACT OF SLUD GE CONCENTRATION  
As demonstrated in Chapter 5, the impact of WAS concentration on rheology during TH are significant as 
in situ measurement is still showing a power -law increase of yield stress with concentration (Figure S.565) 
and this matter should not be overlooked. In some TH processes, sludge concentration varies as a result 
of dilution by process steam, as well as by the addition water to dilute the treated sludge (Barber, 2016). 
Then, in the case of highly concentrated WAS, a significant drop in its yield stress and apparent viscosity 
should be expected as it becomes diluted. Sludge -handli ng equipment must be appropriately designed to 
accommodate these changes in order to maintain the desired flow conditions.  
As TH processes is more economical at thicker feed sludges, sludge viscoelastic properties are also 
important to be considered in p rocess design. Viscoelastic measurements in Chapter 6 showed gel -like, 
viscoelastic behaviour still existed in thermally -treated WAS despite significant reduction in G’ and G”. 
This must be taken into consideration when designing mixing systems, since the presence of viscoelasticity 
determines the mixing power (Reviol et al., 2016). This becomes particularly important in anaerobic 
digestion where efficient mixing is required to ensure adequate contact between the treated sludge and 
microorganisms. The visco elastic parameters G’, G”, τ, and yield stress plays significant role in the 
formation of inactive zones during mixing (Bhattacharjee et al., 2017) . 
An example is shown below to demonstrate the impact of changing sludge concentrations during TH on 
mixing power requirements.  -1135791113

 Given a TH process at 120 °C tr eating 12 wt% sludge. At the end of treatment, water was added to dilute 
the sludge to 9 wt% in order to control ammonia inhibition in downstream anaerobic digestion process 
(Barber,2016). The change in mixing power can be determined. It is assumed the rhe ological parameters 
of the untreated sludge, initially at 7 wt%: k = 4.5 Pa.sn, σc = 44 Pa, n = 0.4.

Where, P = power input (W); h = impeller height (m); DT = tank diameter (m); N = impeller rotational speed

It is assumed a tank diameter 0.5 m; an agitator height of 0.5 m; agitator diameter of 0.3 m and agitator 
speed of 2 rps.  
To solve Eq. 7.1.1, the consistency index, k, must be determined for 12 wt% sludge at 120 °C and 60 min 
TH; using Eq. 5.2:  
𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−𝐴2(𝑇)−𝐵2ln(𝑡)+𝐶2 
𝐴2=5 × 0.122.6=0.02 
𝐵2=50 × 0.122.8=0.13

𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−0.02(120)−0.13ln(60)+3.9 
𝑘𝑖4.5⁄=0.97 
𝑘𝑖=4.5∗0.97=4.36 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛  
Similarly, k for 9 wt% sludge due to dilution can be determined at 120 °C and 60 minutes:  
 𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−𝐴2(𝑇)−𝐵2ln(𝑡)+𝐶2  
195 
 𝐴2=5 × 0.092.6=0.01 
𝐵2=50 × 0.092.8=0.06

𝑘𝑖𝑘7,0⁄=−0.01(120)−0.06ln(60)+1.86 
𝑘𝑖4.5⁄=0.41 
𝑘𝑖=4.5∗0.41=1.85 𝑃𝑎.𝑠𝑛 
Since all flow curves measured in -situ could be described by a single master curve (Fig 5.2), the n = 0.4 
value applies at any condition of treatment. Then the power required for mixing prior to sludge dilution:  
𝑃= 𝜋2(0.5)(0.52)(2)(4.36)(4𝜋×2)0.4
(0.4(1−(0.3
0.5)2
0.4))0.4
 =58.2 𝑊 
Then, after sludge was diluted to 9 wt%:  
𝑃= 𝜋2(0.5)(0.52)(2)(1.85)(4𝜋×2)0.4
(0.4(1−(0.3
0.5)2
0.4))0.4
 =24.7 𝑊 
A mixing power reduction of about 60% would occur due to the sludge dilution, which could be 
determined by e stimating changes in rheological parameters during TH, based on varying sludge 
concentrations. This can help to optimise the required mixing power for when sludge concentration is 
varied in the reactor, which in turn contributes to electrici ty cost  savings.  
7.2.5 VISCOELASTICE BEHAVIOUR OF THERMAL LY TREATED SLUDGE  
The frequency response (Figure 6.4) revealed gel stability in the treated sludge, since the slope of the G’ 
at different frequencies was relatively small and G’ was mostly greater than 100 Pa at low angular 
velocities. This means the sludge exhibits strong structural strength at rest. Then, the sludge is unlikely to 
exhibit settling and phase separation (Mezger, 2006). This would imply, at least for the range of sludge 
concentration s studied, there is not a need to pump sludge under turbulent conditions for the purpose of 
mitigating blockages due to settling effects. On the other hand, it also validates the observed improved  
196 
 dewaterability of thermally -treated sludges by other resear chers such as Feng et al. (2014b) and Wang et 
al. (2017 ) since  G’ values of treated sludge are significantly reduced compared to untreated sludge. The 
frequency and creep responses of highly concentred sludge were described for the first time by th e FKV 
model across all treatment conditions studied. The FKV model can be used in CFD programs to reliably 
design and optimise the efficiency of pumping, mixing systems and heat exchangers.  
 
7.2.6 APPROXIMATING STEADY SHEAR PROPERT IES FROM OSCILLATORY  
MEAS UREMENT  
The comparability between dynamic viscosity and steady shear viscosity (Chapter 6.4.2) allows viscoelastic 
data, as obtained from oscillatory measurements, to approximate steady -shear data.  
As sludge handling is being carried out at increasingly h igher sludge concentrations, difficulties arise in its 
reliable rheological measurement in traditional steady -shear methods. This is due to challenges related 
to overcoming edge effects and cracking of the sample in steady -shear because of the pasty nature  of the 
thickened sludge. Researchers have proposed various methods for characterizing the rheological 
properties of highly concentrated sludges (15 – 45 wt%) (Baudez et al., 2016; Mouzaoui et al., 2018) . 
However, for sludges of moderately high concentration (<15 wt%) and  thermally -treated sludge, the 
modified Cox -Merz approach (Chapter 6.4.2) offers a much more simple, alternative solution. This  method  
provides a non -destructive measurement technique for collecting sludge flow data through oscillation 
data. Furthermore, it suggests that online rheometers which operate based on colleting viscoelastic data 
can potentially be used to generating steady -shear parameters.  
An alternative method of calculating yield stress from oscillatory measurement (Table 6.4) was also 
sugges ted, which can be a quick way to approximate yield stress values for design calculations such as 
those examples previously described.  
 
7.3 CONCLUSION  
This chapter presented some of the potential areas of applying the knowledge developed within this thesis,  
particularly in sludge -handling applications and hydrothermal sludge processes.  An illustration of how to 
utilize the developed master flow curve for thermally treated sludge was demonstrated, and how the 
rheological parameters obtained are essential to correctly sizing pumps and heat transfer units. Usage of  
197 
 the in -situ equations for estimating sludge rheological parameters during TH from after thermal treatment 
data were also demonstrated in the examples provided. The significance of sludge concentratio n with 
regard to its impact on TH processes and the implications of the viscoelastic properties of thermally -
treated sludge were also discussed. Finally, the significance of the oscillatory measurements as a means 
of approximating steady -shear parameters p rovides a new way of non -destructive technique for 
rheological characterisation of highly concentrated sludge.  
 
APPENDIX 7.1 REYNOLD S-3 CALCULATIONS  
For Herschel -Bulkley fluids, the transitional pipe flow is determined using the Reynolds -3 number 
(Slatter, 2008):  
𝑅𝑒3= 8𝜌𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑛2

) 
The rheological parameters of the sludge were determined:  
σc = 90.1 Pa  
k = 27.1 Pa.sn 
n = 0.4  
Firstly, a wall shear stress was assumed as some factor of the yield stress:  
σw = 1.25( σc) = 1.25*(90.1) = 112.63 Pa.  
Then, sludge velocity was determined using (Slatter, 2008):

Then, volumetric flow rate of the plug is determined:  
𝑄𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑔=𝐴𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑔×𝑉𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑔=0.02(0.0036)=7.24∗10−5 𝑚3/𝑠 
Then, flow rate of the annular gap is determined:

Then, Re 3 is solved by replacing known terms:

(90.1+27.1(8×0.0027

)=0.00055  
Since this value of Re 3 is very low, the wall shear stress, σw, from the first step is re-evaluated  by 
multiplying σc with a new factor. The above calculations are repeated until Re 3=2100 is obtained, such 
that:  
σw = 5.05( σc) = 5.05(90.1) = 455.28 Pa,  
V = 10.6 m/s  
Re3 =2100  
Then, critical velocity is Vc = 10.6 m/s.

RECOMMENDATIONS

 8.1 RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS  
In this chapter, the key findings, observations, and conclusions in this research work are presented in 
summary. Additionally, some recommendations for future work are described based on some of the 
observations which may have been of interest  but was outside of the scope of the present study. The 
primary conclusions in this thesis are:  
• Waste activated sludge (WAS) behaves as a non -Newtonian, shear -thinning fluid exhibiting yield 
stress, described by the Herschel -Bulkley rheological model. This  was true for the untreated and 
thermally -treated (80 – 140 °C) sludge at ambient conditions. More importantly, sludge did not 
exhibit Newtonian behaviour at any point during thermal hydrolysis (TH), despite being subjected 
elevated temperature conditions.  During TH, the sludge continued to exhibit non -Newtonian 
behaviour. Therefore, this must be considered during the design and operation of hydrothermal 
sludge treatment processes.  Notably, this is the first time such observation has been made for 
WAS, sinc e no previous work had measured sludge rheology at the elevated temperature 
conditions of this study.  
 
• During TH (80 – 140 °C), the apparent viscosity, η, and Herschel -Bulkley rheological parameters 
(yield stress, σc, and consistency index, k) decreased logarithmically with time at constant 
temperature. This suggested that the solubilisation of sludge organics due to TH was also a time -
dependent process. This progressive reduction in σc, η, and k during TH had not been shown 
before in previous  works ; this observation was made possible through direct  measurements in 
situ carried out in this work . This observation provides additional insight into the kinetics of 
sludge solubilisation during TH and may be a useful tool in future studies. Furthermo re, the η, σc, 
and k followed a linear relationship with temperature at constant treatment time. In -situ values 
of η, σc, and k during TH could be estimated for various treatment conditions using a combined 
model based on aforementioned relationships.  
 
• The flow behaviour of untreated, thermally -treated, and in -situ WAS at various conditions of TH 
and sludge concentrations could be described using a single master flow curve. This meant a 
similar network of physical interactions governing its flow behaviour e xisted within the sludge, 
regardless of sludge concentration and thermal treatment condition.  
  
202 
 •  Due to TH, the η, σc, and k of thermally -treated sludge decreased irreversibly by upwards of 89% 
at ambient conditions compared to their corresponding values of untreated sludge. The extent 
of this reduction followed a linear relationship with treatment temperature. In all cases, η, σc, 
and k of cooled (25 °C), post -thermally treated sludge was higher than their corresponding values 
in situ (80 – 140 °C); the extent of this difference followed a linear relationship with temperature.  
 
• The solubilization of sludge organics during TH sho wed a logarithmic time -dependent behaviour 
at constant temperature, as determined from measurement of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
in the soluble phase of sludge. This reflects the logarithmic time -dependent reduction of η, σc, 
and k during rheological mea surements under similar conditions. Accordingly, linear correlation 
existed between the reduction of rheological parameters ( η, σc, and, k) and solubilization of COD.  
Although such correlation had been shown  previously for lower -temperature thermal treatment, 
this was the first time this correlation was examined for TH. This supports the implication that 
the rheological changes due to TH were a result of disintegration of sludge’s network structure. 
These stru ctural components were believed to be composed of extracellular polymeric 
substances whi ch are destroyed during TH and transitioned into the soluble phase as soluble COD.  
 
• At increasing sludge concentrations, η, σc, and k increased following a power -law r elationship. 
This was true for untreated sludge as well as in -situ TH sludge at all temperatures and times of 
treatment investigated. The fundamental actions governing the intensification of viscous forces 
in sludge at higher concentrations remained signif icant despite solubilisation of sludge 
components during TH. Furthermore, regardless of sludge concentration the extent and rate of 
η, σc, and k reduction was nearly constant. This means the effectiveness of sludge solubilisation 
due to TH was not impacted  by varying sludge concentrations, which allows for more flexible 
choice of operating TH at higher concentrations. This has not been discussed before in earlier 
studies.  
 
• Viscoelastic measurements reveal gel -like characteristics in the sludge before and af ter TH. 
However, as a result of TH the structural integrity of the thermally -treated sludge was weakened, 
as shown by values of storage ( G’) and loss ( G”) moduli which decreased linearly with increasing 
treatment temperatures. As a result of higher TH temp eratures, the loss factor (G”/G’) increased 
which reveals a greater extent of network destruction. The frequency dependence and creep 
behaviour of the sludges were described using a fractional derivatives Kelvin -Voigt model (FKV)   
203 
 for the first time in TH s ludge . Fitting parameters of the FKV model revealed weakening elastic 
portion of the sludge at higher treatment temperatures.  
 
•  Viscoelastic data which are obtained via oscillatory measurements could be used to represent 
steady -shear data, which are tradi tionally obtained via rotational measurements. Plots of the 
dynamic viscosity, η’(ω), nearly overlaps with plots of the steady shear viscosity, η(γ̇), when 
assuming the angular velocity was equal to shear rate (i.e. ω =γ̇). This highlights the potential fo r 
steady -shear data collection of thickened sludges and pasty material based on non -destructive 
oscillatory measurement. Besides that, it was possible to estimate yield stress values by 
multiplying G’ to shift factors.  
 
• Practical engineering implications of this study’s findings were discussed and highlights the 
importance of careful determination of rheological parameters in optimizing unit operations.  
 
8.2 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES  
• The current study was focused rheological investigation on non -oxidative hydrothermal processes, 
namely TH. However, oxidative hydrothermal sludge treatment processes are also of interest in 
sludge treatment processes. These processes, such as wet oxidation, operate similar to non -
oxidative processes but involve much h igher treatment temperatures and simultaneous oxidation 
reactions in the sludge. It is of interest whether the same observations made in this study can 
apply to these more demanding processes. Besides that, advanced TH processes (also termed 
thermochemical  treatment) which involve the addition of chemical reagents in TH are also of 
interest. These processes operate in the lower range of TH temperatures but are enhanced by 
chemical addition. It is of interest how these chemicals (which often increases pH) af fect sludge 
rheology. Recent advances in rheometers (for high temperature and pressure measurements) will 
allow the above studies to be conducted with relative ease.  
 
• The equations for relating the rheological changes in situ during TH were developed empi rically 
only for the limited range of variables examined (treatment temperature, time and sludge 
concentration). For example, a linear model was used to describe the reduction of sludge 
apparent viscosity as a function of sludge temperature in this study, but this could only be true in 
the range of temperature examined. The more fundamental laws governing these interactions  
204 
 were beyond the scope of this work and were not comprehensively studied. It is of interest 
whether a more robust model which incorporat es fundamental kinetic models for sludge 
hydrolysis could be developed.  
 
• The current study primarily quantified the organic solubilisation due to TH in terms of the bulk 
organic matter solubilisation. However, it was difficult to relate these to specific c omponents in 
the sludge, which may or may not play a major role in sludge’s rheological behaviour. It has been 
shown in literature that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) plays a major role in sludge 
viscosity, and this is suspected to also be the ca se in this study. However, it would be interesting 
to measure changes in the EPS during TH more directly and relate these changes to rheological 
observations. Recent studies have shown interesting methods to quantify EPS more descriptively, 
such as the str atified EPS method (Yuan et al., 2017) . It would be interesting to apply these 
methods to sludge TH.  
 
• The rheological measurement of increasingly thickened sludges presented an ongoing challenge 
in this current study. Due to the pasty nature of the concentrated sludge, practical issues arose 
during rotational measurement and, to some extent, in oscillatory measurement. These issues 
included sample bifurcation and migration, in th e case of parallel plate measurement geometries, 
and wall slippage, shear -banding, rod -climbing, and un -sheared zones, in the case of Couette -type 
geometries. The current study proposed one method to correlate oscillatory measurements to 
rotational measure ments, while avoiding most of the above practical challenges. Traditionally, a 
Cox-Merz empirical relation, which states: η*(ω) = η(γ̇), could be applied to most polymer 
solutions. As expected, this relation was inapplicable to sludge, which showed gel -like character. 
However, in the current study it was found an alternative correlation could be made , based on 
Sprigg ’s theory : η’(ω) ≈ η(γ̇). It is of interest why this correlation is valid instead of the traditional 
Cox-Merz relation, and whether it also applies to other materials.  
 
• The current study was limited to waste activated sludge, which is highly biological and organic in 
composition. However, there has been interest in using mixed sludges in hydrothermal processes, 
especially in oxidative processes. It will be of interest how  a varying composition of sludge will 
affect its rheological behaviour and the reduction of rheological parameters during hydrothermal 
processing.
