Keywords:DegradationElectron shuttlePollutantsRemediationRedox mediatorWastewater treatmentDuring the last two decades, extensive research has explored the catalytic effects of different organic
molecules with redox mediating properties on the anaerobic (bio)transformation of a wide variety of organicand inorganic compounds. The accumulated evidence points at a major role of electron shuttles in the redox
conversion of several distinct contaminants, bo th by chemical and biological mechanisms. Many
microorganisms are capable of reducing redox mediators linked to the anaerobic oxidation of organic andinorganic substrates. Electron shuttles can also be chemically reduced by electron donors commonly found inanaerobic environments (e.g. sul ﬁde and ferrous iron). Reduced electron shuttles can transfer electrons to
several distinct electron-withdrawing compounds, such as azo dyes, polyhalogenated compounds,
nitroaromatics and oxidized metalloids, among others. Moreover, reduced molecules with redox propertiescan support the microbial reduction of electron acceptors, such as nitrate, arsenate and perchlorate. The aim
of this review paper is to summarize the results of reductive (bio)transformation processes catalyzed by
electron shuttles and to indicate which aspects should be further investigated to enhance the applicability ofredox mediators on the (bio)transformation of contaminants.

1. Introduction
The chemical and petrochemical industry produces worldwide
thousands of compounds each year and it is still in expansion. The
global market of this sector is huge and only during the ﬁrst 9 months
of 2004, the sales in the USA summed up US$110.4 billion for 26companies of the chemical sector ( Storck et al., 2005 ). Unfortunately,
linked to the great economical bene ﬁts obtained from the chemical
and petrochemical production, large volumes of wastewaters contain-
ing many different toxic and recalcitrant pollutants are being
discharged ( Razo-Flores et al., 2006 ). Among the contaminants
generated are electron-withdrawing compounds, such as azo dyes,

oxidized compounds; PHP, polyhalogenated pollutants; DHP, dehalogenated pollutants.257 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277nitroaromatics, halogenated aliphatics, halogenated aromatics and
metalloids, which remain unaffected during conventional aerobic
wastewater treatment. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, these
contaminants can undergo reductive transformations ( Field et al.,
1995 ). During the last two decades, evidence accumulated showing
the potential to convert pollutants containing electrophilic groups in
their structures, in high-rate anaerobic bioreactors, such as up ﬂow
anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) and expanded granular sludge bed
(EGSB) systems ( Donlon et al., 1996; Christiansen et al., 1997; Razo-
Flores et al., 1999; Van der Zee et al., 2001; Dos Santos et al., 2005c ).
However, reductive transformation of many different recalcitrant
compounds proceeds very slowly due to electron transfer limitations
and to toxicity effects leading to poor performance or even collapse of
anaerobic bioreactors ( Rodgers and Bunce, 2001; Van der Zee et al.,
2001 ).
Since the 1990s, extensive research has been conducted to explore
the catalytic effects of different electron shuttles on redox (bio)
transformation processes. Electron shuttles, also referred to as redox
mediators (RM), are organic molecules that can reversibly be oxidizedand reduced, thereby conferring the capacity to serve as an electron
carrier in multiple redox reactions. As will be explained below, RM
accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy of the total
reaction. In some cases, the presence of RM may even be a prerequisite
for the reaction to take place.
RM are capable of transferring electrons in redox reactions
between a wide variety of both inorganic and organic compounds.Fig. 1 illustrates most redox reactions involved in the reduction and
oxidation of RM by abiotic and biological means. Reduction of RM can
be promoted by chemical reaction with reductants commonly found
in many anaerobic environments (e.g. sul ﬁde, cysteine, Fe(II))
(Schwarzenbach et al., 1990; Curtis and Reinhard, 1994 ) or by electron
donors proposed in restoration technologies (e.g. zero-valent iron
(ZVI), Ti(III) citrate) ( Tratnyek et al., 2001; Dror and Schlautman, 2004;
Keum and Li, 2004 ). Furthermore, reduction of RM can be linked to the
anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates by microorganisms. The
most relevant RM supporting the microbial oxidation of organic
compounds under anaerobic conditions are humic substances and
their quinoid analogues ( Field and Cervantes, 2005 ). Microbial
Fig. 2. Structure of the main redox mediators reported in the literature.258 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277reduction of quinones can be linked to the anaerobic oxidation of a
large variety of organic substrates including alcohols, short chain fatty
acids, monosaccharides ( Lovley et al., 1996; Cervantes et al., 2000a ), as
well as priority pollutants, such as toluene ( Cervantes et al., 2001a ),
vinyl chloride, dichloroethene ( Bradley et al., 1998 ) and phenolic
compounds ( Cervantes et al., 2000a,b ). On the opposite site, several
electron-withdrawing compounds accept electrons from reduced RM,thereby promoting their re-oxidation. From the environmental or
public health point of view, the most relevant redox reactions involved
in the re-oxidation of RM include the abiotic transfer of electrons from
reduced RM towards azo dyes ( Rau et al., 2002 ), nitroaromatics
(Tratnyek and Macalady, 1989; Borch et al., 2005; Kwon and Finneran,
2006 ), polyhalogenated pollutants ( Curtis and Reinhard, 1994;
Kappler and Haderlein, 2003 ) and U(VI) ( Fredrickson et al., 2000 ). In
these reactions, quinones or humic materials are the most studied RM.
Reduced quinones can also serve as electron donors to support the
microbial reduction of perchlorate, arsenate, nitrate, nitrite and
nitrous oxide ( Lovley et al., 1999; Aranda-Tamaura et al., 2007 ).
Fig. 2 illustrates the structure of several electron shuttles reported
during the redox (bio)transformation of pollutants. For a RM to be an
effective electron shuttle, its standard redox potential ( E
0′) should
ideally be in between those of the two eventual half reactions.
However, as the RM's ef ﬁcacy will also depend on the activation
energy of its reduction and oxidation, in comparison to that of the
non-mediated total reaction, it may occur that even compounds with
E0′lower than the primary electron donor or higher than the terminal
electron acceptor may also be effective RM.
The concept of mediated electron transfer has been known for a very
long time. As early as 1931, in a study on bacterial electricity generation, it
was demonstrated that electromotively active organic compounds, such
as benzoquinone, or inorganic compounds, such as ferricyanide, could
increase the electric current of a bacterial half-cell ( Cohen, 1931 ). To our
knowledge, the ﬁrst paper mentioning a role of quinoid enzyme cofactors
in the reduction of azo dyes dates from the late 1960s ( Roxon et al., 1967 ).
RM-catalyzed reduction of nitroaromatics has ﬁrstly been reported by
Brown (1981) . Moreover, the rate of reduction of several halogenated
hydrocarbons was shown to improve with increasing the amount of
natural organic matter (NOM) in sediments ( Peijnenburg et al., 1992 ),
presumably due to the catalytic input of redox active groups in NOM.
Nevertheless, Tratnyek and Macalady (1989) and Curtis and Reinhard
(1994) were probably the ﬁrst researchers to focus their research on
evidencing the input of RM on the reduction of nitroaromatics and
polyhalogenated pollutants, respectively. From then on, and certainly
after the publication of other thorough papers on basic aspects of the role
of RM ( Keck et al., 1997; Kudlich et al., 1997 ) and the boosting attention to
microbial fuel cells ( Bullen et al., 2006; Logan et al., 2006 )t h et o p i c
became increasingly popular, both in basic and in applied research. The
application of RM for wastewater treatment and aquifer bioremediation
has deserved considerable attention during the last years. The ﬁrst studies
focused on the application of RM on reductive (bio)transformation of
contaminants were carried out during the decolorization of azo dyes in
high rate UASB reactors ( Cervantes et al., 2001b; Van der Zee et al., 2001 ).
The aim of this review paper is to summarize the results of RM-
catalyzed reductive (bio)transformation processes. The article describes
the impact of different RM on azo dye reduction (Section 2), reductive
dehalogenation (Section 3) and reduction of nitroaromatics (Section 4).
Section 5 brie ﬂye x e m p l i ﬁes miscellaneous redox reactions catalyzed by
RM. Finally, Section 6 proposes several research areas required to improve
the applicability of RM on the (bio)transformation of contaminants.
2. Role of redox mediators on azo dye reduction2.1. Introduction
Azo dyes are aromatic structures linked together by azo ( –NfN–)
chromophores. They represent the largest class of dyes applied intextile-processing industries. Due to their color and possible muta-
genicity, their removal from wastewater is of major concern. For that
purpose, sequential anaerobic –aerobic treatment is the most logical
biological strategy for the removal of azo dyes from wastewater. The
dyes' electron withdrawing azo linkages, which are very recalcitrant
towards oxidative reactions, can be reduced under anaerobic condi-
tions, yielding aromatic amines. These aromatic amines are in turnlikely to be removed by aerobic treatment, through a combination of
biodegradation, autoxidation and adsorption ( Field et al., 1995; Van
der Zee and Villaverde, 2005 ). Anaerobic azo dye reduction has been
thoroughly investigated and several review papers summarize the
results, e.g. Stolz (2001) andPandey et al. (2007) . It is clear that most, if
not all, azo compounds are susceptible to reductive ﬁssion and that
the capacity to reduce azo dyes under anaerobic conditions is almost
ubiquitous among a wide range of bacterial species. In addition, azo
dyes can be chemically reduced by bulk reducing agents, such as
sulﬁde. Consequently, anaerobic bioreactor treatment of azo dye
containing wastewaters will normally lead to a certain extent of
reductive decolorization. In a recent review of a large number of
bioreactor studies it was concluded that the extent of anaerobic color
removal in these studies was generally high (70 –100%) but that
decolorization often proceeds very slowly, requiring long hydraulic
residence times ( Van der Zee and Villaverde, 2005 ). It is obvious,
therefore, that accelerating azo dye reduction by electron shuttling
RM will be highly relevant for the applicability of biological techniques
to remove azo dyes from wastewater.
Tables 1 –5give a summary of the studies reporting the impact of
RM on the rates of azo dye reduction in different biological and
chemical systems. In the ‘Results ’columns of the tables, it can be seen
that RM accelerated the reaction in most of the systems studied, often
doubling to multiplying the reaction rates. In some cases, the presence
of a RM even appeared as a prerequisite for the reaction to take place.
However, the impact of RM was not always huge: sometimes the
accelerating effect was small, sometimes absent, and in rare cases
even adverse. This wide range of RM impacts re ﬂects the differences
between the investigated systems, their conditions, the dye/mediator/
biomass-combinations used, etc. In the following sections, the most
important factors determining the impact of RM on azo dye reduction
will be discussed.
2.2. Redox mediator properties
Several of the studies listed in Tables 1 –5report different impacts
of distinct RM under otherwise similar circumstances. Part of these
differences may be directly related to the E0′of the shuttling
compounds investigated. In addition, other physico-chemical proper-
ties of the shuttling compound may play a role in determining its
feasibility and strength as a mediator for azo dye reduction.
2.2.1. Oxidation –reduction potential
By de ﬁnition, an electron shuttling compound will only be
effective as a RM for azo dye reduction if it lowers the reaction's
activation energy. For that purpose, its E0′should ideally be in between
those of the two eventual half reactions, the reduction of an azo dye
and the oxidation of a primary electron donor:
–A mediator's E0′should not be much lower (ideally higher or less
negative) than that of the biological reducing system (typically
−320 mV, representing the E0′of NAD(P)H, the cofactor with the
lowest oxidation –reduction potential) or the bulk reductant (e.g.
−270 mV in case of sul ﬁde)—otherwise it will not be reduced
sufﬁciently. Hence the observed failure of cyanocobalamin ( Dos
Santos et al., 2004a ) and ethyl viologen ( Kudlich et al., 1997 ) to act
as a mediator is most probably due to their too low E0′values: −530
and−480 mV, respectively. Methyl viologen ( E0′=−440 mV) was the
most reduced shuttling compound with clear ability to act as a RM259 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277for azo dye reduction. It modestly increased the rate of Acid Red 27
reduction by Sphingomonas (Kudlich et al., 1997 ) but its impact on
the reduction of Acid Yellow 23 by Bacteroides was huge, a 4.5-fold
increase of the reaction rate, similar or even better than that of
mediators with a higher E0′(Chung et al., 1978 ). Especially the latter
result is remarkable, since methyl viologen's E0′is considerably
lower than the indicated boundary level of −320 mV.–Likewise, a mediator's E0′should not be much higher (ideally lower
or more negative) than that of the azo dye —otherwise it will not
reduce the azo linkage at suf ﬁcient rates. Since E0′-values for azo
dyes, which will be unique for each speci ﬁc compound, are not
available, it is less easy to estimate top boundary values for a
mediator's E0′. Polarographically determined half-wave standard
potentials ( E1/2) give an indication. However, reported E1/2-values

between values reported for the same azo dye can vary as much as
200 mV ( Dubin and Wright, 1975; Bragger et al., 1997; Semdé et al.,
1998 ). Another and probably better indication was the result of an
experiment in which the reduction of the azo dye Acid Red 27 by a
large number of chemically reduced quinoid shuttling compounds
with different E0′values was investigated. This experiment
demonstrated that this particular dye, which has an E1/2of around
−250 mV ( Dubin and Wright, 1975; Semdé et al., 1998 ) or around
−350 mV ( Bragger et al., 1997 ), could only be reduced by quinones
with E0′values below −50 mV ( Rau et al., 2002 ). For other azo dyes,
this threshold value, which re ﬂects the dye's E0′in combination
with the reaction's activation energy, may be different, but it is
reasonable to assume that the observed failure of 1,4-Benzoquinone
to act as a mediator ( Dos Santos et al., 2005c ) and the poor impact
reported for Menadione ( Chung et al.,1978; Albuquerque et al., 2005 )
are most probably due to their too high E0′-values: +263 and −19 mV,
respectively.
–In the E0′range between these boundaries, there will be two
opposing trends with respect to a mediator's E0′and its impact on
the rate of azo dye reduction. In the second step of mediated azo
dye reduction, i.e. the chemical reaction between the reducedmediator and the azo dye, the reaction rate will increase with
decreasing E0′of the mediator, as has been demonstrated with the
reduction of Acid Red 27 by a series of chemically reduced
quinones with different E0′values ( Rau et al., 2002 ). In the ﬁrst step
of mediated azo dye reduction, i.e. reduction of the mediator, an
opposite trend, an increase of the reaction rate with increasing E0′
of the mediator, can be expected. The rate-limiting step of
mediated azo dye reduction will thus be in ﬂuenced by the
mediator's E0′, with either the reduction of the dye or that of the
mediator being rate-limiting, at higher and lower E0′values,
respectively. At midrange, combination of both trends may reveal
the optimum mediator's E0′(unique for each dye/reducing system
combination), where both reaction steps proceed at equal rate.
However, in biological systems ( Tables 1 –4), such an optimum E0′
could not be con ﬁrmed: studies with multiple redox mediators
under otherwise similar conditions did not show any relationshipbetween a mediator's E
0′and the rate of azo dye reduction ( Chung
et al., 1978; Kudlich et al., 1997; Rau et al., 2002 ), and mediators
with identical E0′(FAD, FMN and AQS) often had largely different
impacts. For instance, Kudlich et al. (1997) observed that Acid Red 27
reduction by Sphingomonas BN6 was stimulated to a decreasing
extent by the following mediators (values between brackets show E0′Table 2

(−360) NMethyl viologen( −440) N,F A D( −219). Moreover, the
impact of ﬁve quinoid mediators on the reduction of Acid Red 27
by ten pure cultures of distinct classes of bacteria showed largedifferences between cultures, with different sequences of these ﬁve
compounds when ranged according to their effect ( Rau et al., 2002 ).
These results re ﬂect the diverging and apparently E
0′-independent
preferences of biological mediator reduction. In contrast, in chemical
systems, the mediator's E0′may very well be more important in
determining its reduction rate. However, none of the studies listed
inTable 5 allows for either con ﬁrming or rejecting such a
relationship.
From the above it is clear that mediated azo dye reduction, at least
in biological systems, is largely independent of the mediator's E0′, and
that this independence is probably mostly due to reduction of the
mediator rather than to that of the dye. Therefore, it is likely that the
mechanism of mediator reduction is responsible for the observed
different impacts of different mediators. However, since diverging
mediator preferences of different microorganisms suggest they usedistinct enzyme systems to reduce mediators, any possible correlation
between the mediators' physico-chemical properties (e.g. size, charge,
functional groups, etc.) and their impact on azo dye reduction is
inevitably vague. The clearest trend, one that seems almost general, isthat AQS is a more powerful mediator than AQDS ( Rau et al., 2002; Dos
Santos et al., 2004a; Hong et al., 2007 ). Although it cannot be excluded
that this difference is solely a result of E
0′differences, it is possible that
the presence of an additional sulfonate group in AQDS diminishes the
ease at which the compound approaches the enzyme.
2.2.2. Ability to cross the cell membrane
A property of electron shuttling compounds that deserves attention is
the ability to cross cell membranes. It has been demonstrated that the
azoreductase activity of cell extracts can be much higher than that of intact
cells and that the cell membrane forms a barrier for dyes and mediators
(Kudlich et al., 1997; Russ et al., 2000 ). Hence, mediated azo dye reduction
bySphingomonas xenophaga , with the sulfonated quinone AQS as the
optimum mediator, is presumably associated with the membrane-bound
respiratory chain enzyme NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( Kudlich
et al., 1997; Rau et al., 2002 ), and several other species are likely to useTable 4

been shown for E. coli , the mechanism can also be based on intracellular
enzymes in combination with a mediator that diffuses through the cell
membrane. E. coli 's mediator-dependent ‘azoreductase' was identi ﬁed as
two cytosolic oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases, acting as quinone
reductases. The mediator was Lawsone, the only quinone with a
mediator-feasible E0′that could be reduced by the enzymes ( Rau and
Stolz, 2003 ). Lawsone's apparent ability to cross the cell membrane is
probably related to its small size and its relative lipophilicity (no charged
substituents). Depending on the preferences of intracellular reductases in
other species, there may be more shuttling compounds with membrane-
crossing properties that could act as powerful mediators for azo dye
reduction.
2.2.3. Solubility vs. non-solubility
While the large majority of the studies listed in Tables 1 –5dealt
with water-soluble compounds as redox mediators for azo dye
reduction, a few investigations demonstrated redox-mediating
properties of non-soluble materials. Especially activated carbon
(Van der Zee et al., 2003; Mezohegyi et al., 2007 ), to a lesser extent
graphite ( Mezohegyi et al., 2007 ) and to some extent alginate beads
with immobilized anthraquinone ( Guo et al., 2007 ) have been shown
to accelerate azo dye reduction in biological systems. As graphite,
which was shown to act as mediator in contrast to the non-
conductive material aluminium ( Mezohegyi et al., 2007 ), does not
contain speci ﬁc groups on its surface, it is clear that catalysis of
biological azo dye reduction does not necessarily depend on redox-
active surface groups. Nevertheless, the considerably higher dye
reduction kinetics obtained with activated carbon as compared tographite ( Mezohegyi et al., 2007 ) indicates that surface groups play
an important role. Therefore, activated carbon or other insoluble
materials with surface-associated or entrapped redox-active func-
tional groups can be considered the most logical candidates as
insoluble redox mediators. The catalytic properties of such insoluble
materials enable their use as biologically regenerable RM in
anaerobic bioreactors. As these materials can be retained in the
reactor for prolonged time, they are attractive alternatives to soluble
RM that need to be dosed continuously.
2.3. Mediator/dye-ratio
Tables 1 –5show that a wide range of molar mediator/dye-ratios
has been applied. In several studies, two or more ratios have
investigated, usually by changing the mediator concentration ( Roxon
et al., 1967; Walker et al., 1971; Kudlich et al., 1997; Van der Zee et al.,
2000; Cervantes et al., 2001b; Van der Zee et al., 2001; Rau et al., 2002;
Dos Santos et al., 2003; Field and Brady, 2003; Dos Santos et al.,
2004b; Albuquerque et al., 2005; Dos Santos et al., 2005b; Dos Santos
et al., 2005c; Dos Santos et al., 2005d; Yemashova and Kalyuzhnyi,
2006; Hong et al., 2007 ). Dye reduction rates increase with increasing
mediator concentrations. Mediator gradients typically show that the
effect is especially strong at low mediator/dye ratios and levels off at
higher ratios. The mediator/dye-ratios beyond which there is no
additional effect of raising the mediator concentration are mostly
rather high: it is not unusual that maximum azo dye reduction rateshave not yet been reached at molar ratios as high as 1 ( Kudlich et al.,
1997; Van der Zee et al., 2001; Dos Santos et al., 2004b ).Table 5

Reaction rates will increase with increasing temperatures because
a higher fraction of the molecules will have a kinetic energy higher
than the activation energy. This effect, as described by the Arrhenius
equation, will be more pronounced if the reaction's activation energy
is higher. Raising the temperature will thus result in a relatively higherincrease of the rate of non-mediated azo dye reduction (high
activation energy) in comparison to that of mediated azo dye
reduction (lower activation energy). It can be expected that chemical
azo dye reducing systems behave accordingly, as appears to be
conﬁrmed by the results of Dos Santos et al. (2004a) , the only study in
Table 5 that investigated chemical azo dye reduction at different
temperatures. In this study it was observed that the ﬁrst-order
reaction rate constant of non-mediated reduction of Reactive Red 2
(0.3 mM) by sul ﬁde (4.5 mM) was 2.2-fold higher at 55 °C than at
30 °C, and AQS (12 µM) increased these rate constants 1.9-fold and 1.7-
fold at 30 °C and 55 °C, respectively ( Dos Santos et al., 2004a ). In
biological systems, there will be limits to the temperature range of
individual cultures and enzyme systems, as has been demonstrated
for non-mediated azo dye reduction by several pure cultures ( Chang
and Kuo, 2000; Chang et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2001; Pearce et al., 2006;
Angelova et al., 2008 ) but not for mediated azo dye reduction. Mixed
cultures such as sludge will undergo population shifts when the
temperature is changed. It must be taken into account, therefore, that
the results of the studies by Dos Santos et al. (2005c) on azo dye
reduction by mesophilic and thermophilic sludge may at least partly
reﬂect changes of biomass properties.
Most of the results from these studies show the Arrhenius trends,
i.e. higher basic azo dye reduction rates and a relatively smaller impact
of mediators with thermophilic sludge as compared to with
mesophilic sludge. For example, the ﬁrst-order reaction rate constant
of non-mediated reduction of hydrolyzed Reactive Red 2 (0.3 mM) was
5.6-fold higher with thermophilic sludge (55 °C) than with mesophilic
sludge (30 °C), and AQS (12 µM) increased these rate constants 3.8-
fold and 2.3-fold at 30 °C and 55 °C, respectively ( Dos Santos et al.,
2005c ). Comparison of these results with the ones cited above for the
reaction with sul ﬁde, shows a general feature of sludge vs. sul ﬁde, i.e.
a much stronger effect of temperature on non-mediated azo dye
reduction by sludge than by sul ﬁde. This phenomenon may be the
result of differences in the microbial composition between mesophilic
and thermophilic sludge. Alternatively, it may also re ﬂect a tempera-
ture-dependent change of the activation energy, similar to that
observed for non-mediated azo dye reduction by two distinct pure
cultures ( Angelova et al., 2008 ). In contrast, explanations based on the
release of intracellular mediators as a result of higher cell decay at
higher temperatures are probably not valid: it would imply that, due
to the higher pool of mediators, the impact of additional mediators is
lower with sludge than with sul ﬁde, something which is obviously not
the case. Some of the results from the studies by Dos Santos and co-
workers are not in agreement with the Arrhenius trends. The
anomalous decrease of the rate of both mediated and non-mediated
azo dye reduction observed at temperatures beyond the optimum
temperature of 60 °C ( Dos Santos et al., 2003 ) probably re ﬂects the
temperature optimum of the sludge inoculum. In contrast, there is no
clear explanation for the lower relative impact of AQDS on the
reduction of hydrolyzed Reactive Red 2 at 45 °C than at 55 and 60 °C
(Dos Santos et al., 2003 ), and for the higher relative impact of
riboﬂavin on the reduction of Reactive Orange 14 at 55 °C than at 30 °C
(Dos Santos et al., 2005b ).
2.5. Electron donors
RM have been shown to accelerate or even enable azo dye
reduction by microorganisms from many distinct taxonomic and
trophic groups. The primary electron donor of biological azo dyereduction may therefore play a role in determining azo dye reduction
rates: in individual cultures by changing enzyme activities, and in
mixed cultures by stimulating speci ﬁc (trophic groups of) micro-
organisms. The substrate type may thus affect both the rates of direct
(non-mediated) azo dye reduction and those of mediator reduction,
albeit not necessarily to the same extent.
Four of the studies listed in Table 4 , all of them using anaerobic
granular sludge, compared the effects of different substrates on
mediated and non-mediated azo dye reduction ( Van der Zee et al.,
2001; Dos Santos et al., 2003; Dos Santos et al., 2005b; Dos Santos et al.,
2006 ). In one of these studies, evidence was provided for a substrate-
selective effect on the reduction of a mediator: It was observed that
acetate stimulated the AQDS-mediated reduction of Reactive Red 2 by
AQDS-adapted sludge much more than propionate, butyrate or hydro-
gen. In contrast, acetate neither stimulated non-mediated dye reduction,
nor did it have a pronounced effect on mediated azo dye reduction by
non-adapted adapted sludge. Therefore, these results suggest that
enrichment of bacteria or enzyme systems that coupled AQDS-reduction
to oxidation of acetate had taken place ( Van der Zee et al., 2001 ). The
other substrate effect studies were all performed with consortia not
previously adapted to the mediator. Azo dye reduction rates were
different with each particular substrate, and mediators always increased
these rates, albeit to different extents. The values mentioned in the
‘Results ’column in Table 3 express, for each particular substrate
investigated, the impact of the mediator (ribo ﬂavin or AQDS) on the
rate of azo dye reduction, and should therefore mostly be interpreted as
the effect of this substrate on mediator reduction. In some cases, a
positive correlation between these values and the basic non-mediated
rates has been observed. For example, both the non-mediated rates of
azo dye reduction by thermophilic sludge and the relative impact of
AQDS increased along the substrate range volatile fatty acids (VFA) –
Glucose+VFA –Glucose –H2(Dos Santos et al., 2003 ), and a similar
correlation was found for azo dye reduction by thermophilic sludge and
the relative impact of ribo ﬂavin with Endogenous substrate –Acetate –
Formate –H2(Dos Santos et al., 2006 ). In other cases, however, the
observed correlation was negative. For example, along the substrate
range acetate –methanol –formate, the non-mediated azo dye reduction
rates by mesophilic sludge increased but the relative impact of ribo ﬂavin
decreased ( Dos Santos et al., 2006 ). In addition, contradicting results
have been reported for the effect of hydrogen on mediated vs. non-mediated Reactive Red 2 reduction by unadapted mesophilic sludge:
whereas both studies reported that hydrogen was the substrate with the
highest dye reduction rates, the high relative impact of ribo ﬂavin
observed by Dos Santos et al. (2005a) contrasts sharply to the rather
small relative impact of AQDS observed by Van der Zee et al. (2001) .
From these con ﬂicting trends it is impossible to draw conclusions with
respect to substrate preferences for mediator reduction. It is obvious,
however, that the overall azo dye reduction process (as well as non-
mediated azo dye reduction) is much more associated with hydrogen
and glucose oxidation than with the oxidation of VFA.
2.6. Trophic groups and selective inhibitors
The higher azo dye reduction rates with glucose as compared to with
VFA (as discussed in the previous sub-section) suggest that fermentative
bacteria contribute more to azo dye reduction than acetogens and
methanogens. More information about the involvement of fermentative
and methanogenic bacteria was obtained in experiments to the effect of
selective inhibitors on azo dye reduction by anaerobic granular sludge in
t h ep r e s e n c eo fd i f f e r e n te l e c t r o nd o n o r s( D o sS a n t o se ta l . ,2 0 0 5 b ;D o s
Santos et al., 2006 ). Vancomycin, a selective inhibitor of Gram-positive
bacteria, was shown to suppress both non-mediated and mediated azo
dye reduction: it decreased the reduction rates of Reactive Red 2 and
Reactive Orange 14 by both mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic sludge
with 50 –90% and 30 –55%, with glucose and methanol as the electron
donors, respectively, regardless of the presence or absence of ribo ﬂavin. As265 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277most fermentatives are Gram-positive bacteria, these observations
suggest that their involvement in azo dye reduction is considerable.
In contrast to vancomycin, 2-Bromoethanesulfonate (BES), the
selective inhibitor of methanogens, usually did not have much effect
on azo dye reduction by granular sludge. The only exception was a
considerable increase of the non-mediated reduction rates of Reactive
Red 2 and Reactive Orange 14 by thermophilic sludge with hydrogen asthe electron donor. In addition, BES also stimulated, albeit weakly, the
non-mediated reduction of Reactive Red 2 in some other situations, i.e.
with thermophilic sludge and glucose or formate, as well with
mesophilic sludge and hydrogen. These observations point at substrate
competition between methanogenesis and dye reduction, indicating
that non-mediated azo dye reduction was to some extent linked to
oxidation of hydrogen and formate (directly), or to fermentation of
glucose (indirectly, by production of methanogenic substrates). Inter-
estingly, BES did not raise any of the azo dye reduction rates in the
presence of the mediator ribo ﬂavin. On the contrary, its effect, although
insigni ﬁcant, was always negative ( Dos Santos et al., 2005b; Dos Santos
et al., 2006 ). This suggestion of a small contribution of methanogens to
riboﬂavin reduction was con ﬁrmed by the results of pure culture assays
with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. All of the three strains used in
these assays, the thermophiles Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophi-
cusΔHa n da Methanothermobacter -related strain NJ1 and the mesophile
Methanosarcina barkeri , were found capable of ribo ﬂavin-mediated azo
dye reduction. In contrast, only the mesophilic strain could reduce the
azo dye Reactive Red 2 in the absence of ribo ﬂavin ( Dos Santos et al.,
2006 ). The combined results of these sludge and pure culture studies
indicate that the contribution of methanogens to azo dye reduction by
anaerobic sludge is ambiguous but generally limited.
3. Role of redox mediators on reductive dechlorinations
3.1. Introduction
Polychlorinated compounds (PCC) constitute an important group
of contaminants widely spread in wastewaters, groundwater, soils and
off-gasses, due to improper handling, leakage, etc. Due to their
potential hazard for the environment and public health, many PCC are
listed as priority pollutants by the USA environmental protection
agency (EPA). PCC are commonly used as degreasing agents and
solvents in the metal-industry, as cooling ﬂuids in refrigerators, as
pesticides, fungicides or insecticides, or as dielectric ﬂuids or ﬂame
retardants ( Van Eekert, 1999 ).
The role of RM, with different structures and properties, on the
reductive dechlorination of different PCC has been tested during the
last two decades. Tables 6 and 7 summarize the impacts of these RM
on reductive dechlorination processes. The impact of RM on
dechlorinating reactions varies among the different reaction systems
evaluated. Some RM increase the rate and extent of dechlorination of
distinct PCC by several orders of magnitude, under different experi-
mental conditions. However, several dechlorinating reactions were
hardly affected or were even inhibited when different RM were
incorporated. A number of variables are at stake determining the
impact of RM in different dechlorinating reactions, which will be
discussed in the following sections.
3.2. Main factors determining the input of RM in reductive dechlorinations3.2.1. pH
A few studies report on the effect of pH on reductive dechlorina-
tion processes in the presence of different RM. For instance, abiotic
incubations for the reductive dechlorination of hexachloroethane
(HCA) by sul ﬁde (0.25 mM), in the presence of soil humic acids (HA,
25 mg C/L), showed a direct relationship between the pseudo- ﬁrst-
order rate constant ( k) for the reduction of HCA and the pH ( Curtis and
Reinhard, 1994 ). The kvalue increased up to ~5-fold by varying the pHfrom 7.2 to 8.0 in the assays. The ﬁrst-order dependence of the
reaction on pH was attributed to deprotonation of the redox active
groups in HA (e.g. quinones), which was previously proposed during
the reduction of methyl parathion by reduced quinones at different pH
values ( Tratnyek and Macalady, 1989 , see below).
The last hypothesis was corroborated by further experiments
indicating that the kvalue for HCA reduction by anthrahydroquinone-
2,6-disulfonate (AH 2QDS) strongly depends on the pH. Curtis and
Reinhard (1994) postulated that the overall rate expression for HCA
reduction was considered to be the sum of three independent, parallel,
ﬁrst-order reactions:
k′HCA ¼k0½AðOHÞ2/C138þk1½AðOHÞO−/C138þk2½AðOÞ2−
2/C138
Where [A(OH) 2], [A(OH)O−], and [A(O) 22−] represent the concentra-
tions of the fully protonated, the monophenolate, and the diphenolate
forms of AH 2QDS and k0,k1, and k2are the corresponding rate
constants. It was observed that k2was ~8-fold higher than k1while k0
was not different from zero, indicating that the dechlorination process
mediated by quinones proceeds faster at high pH levels.
Similar results occurred during the reductive dechlorination of
HCA and carbon tetrachloride (CT) by cysteine (5 mM) in the presence
of iron porphyrin (30 µM) at different pH values. The second-order
rate constants for the reductive dechlorination of HCA and CT
increased up to 4- and 5-fold, respectively, by raising the pH from
6.0 to 9.3 ( Perlinger et al., 1998 ).
Recent experiments suggest that different reversible functional
groups are involved in redox reactions catalyzed by humic substances
depending on the pH prevailing on the reaction system. Evidence was
provided that non-quinoid (NQ) structures in humus have electron-
carrying capacity (ECC) at pH 6.5; whereas different quinoid (Q 1and
Q2) structures showed ECC at pH 8 ( Ratasuk and Nanny, 2007 ). Q 1was
deﬁned as quinone moieties with electron-withdrawing groups
adjacent to Q 1, while Q 2contains either no substituents near the
quinone or have nearby electron-donating groups with additional
substituents hindering hydrogenolysis through steric interactions. NQ
sites accounted for 21 –56% of ECC in different humic materials;
whereas Q 1and Q 2accounted for 13 –58% and 8 –50% of the total ECC,
respectively ( Ratasuk and Nanny, 2007 ).
3.2.2. Temperature
As described above (azo dyes section), reaction rates will enhance with
increasing temperatures because a higher fraction of the molecules will
have a kinetic energy higher than the activation energy. This was evident
during the reductive dechlorination of HCA by sul ﬁde (1 mM), in the
presence and in the absence of juglone, at different incubation
temperatures ( Perlinger et al., 1996 ). The reduction rate of HCA by sul ﬁde
increased ~15-fold by raising the temperature from 25 °C to 65 °C in non-
mediated reactions; whereas the rate of juglone-mediated reduction
increased ~10 –fold. The inferior effect of temperature on the reduction
rate of HCA observed in juglone-mediated systems, compared to controls
lacking juglone, could be attributed to differences in the apparent
activation energy (Ea) required in the reactions. In agreement with this
observation, a decrease in the Eawas determined when dechlorinating
reactions were conducted with different concentrations of juglone.
Certainly, the Ea obtained in non-mediated reactions was 75±5 kJ/mol;
whereas in the presence of 20 µM juglone, Ea decreased to 52±5 kJ/mol,
and in the presence of 200 µM juglone, Ea was 46±7 kJ/mol ( Perlinger
et al.,1996 ). A lower Ea in mediated reactions implies that the presence of a
RM facilitate the reactants to achieve their reactive state, thus accelerating
the transfer of electrons.
Comparison of the reduction rates of HCA by AH 2QDS, achieved at
25 °C ( Kappler and Haderlein, 2003 ) and at 50 °C ( Curtis and Reinhard,
1994 ), in both cases conducted at pH 8.2 and a AH 2QDS/HCA-ratio of
200, also agrees with the Arrhenius equation. Indeed, the kvalue266 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277obtained for the reduction of HCA was ~3-fold higher at 50 °C ( Curtis
and Reinhard, 1994 ) compared to the reduction rate obtained at 25 °C
(Kappler and Haderlein, 2003 ).3.2.3. Redox potential
As discussed above (azo dyes section), the E0′of a RM should
ideally be in between those of the two eventual half reactions at stake,

of a primary electron donor.
There are several reports indicating the relationship between the E0′
of the RM and the dechlorinating rate observed for different PCC.
During the reductive dechlorination of CT by ZVI, for instance, AQDS
increased the reduction rate of CT at a higher extent (up to 3-fold
higher than non-mediated control) compared to the catalytic effects ofjuglone (up to 2.2-fold higher than non-mediated control) ( Tratnyek
et al., 2001 ). The last correlation is expected as AQDS has a more
negative E
0′compared to juglone. Comparable results were reported
during the reductive dechlorination of perchloroethylene (PCE) by ZVI
in the presence of different quinoid RM ( Doong and Lai, 2005 ).
Hydroquinone, with the lowest E0′, promoted the maximum reduction
rates of PCE by ZVI; whereas p-benzoquinone, with the highest E0′,
caused the lowest reduction rates for PCE.
Biological dechlorination rates catalyzed by distinct RM also
showed a high correlation between the E0′of the RM and the reductive
dechlorinating rates. The last scenario occurred when AQDS, ribo ﬂavin
(RF), and cyanocobalamin (CNB12) were tested as RM during the
anaerobic reduction of CT by anaerobic sludge ( Guerrero-Barajas and
Field, 2005 ). The observed development of reduction rates of CT was
consistent with a decreasing trend of E0′of the RM tested. CNB12,
which has the most negative E0′(−530 mV) enhanced 13.3-fold the
reduction rate of CT, compared to the non-mediated control; whereas
RF (E0′of−208 mV) and AQDS ( E0′of−184 mV)increased the reduction
rate of CT by 4- and 3.7-fold, respectively ( Guerrero-Barajas and Field,
2005 ).
Despite all these lines of evidence, it is important to emphasize
that a change in E0′of the RM does not always re ﬂect a direct
correlation with dechlorinating kinetics. For example, the reduction
rate of CT by sul ﬁde, in the presence of different quinoid RM, was
evaluated as a function of the E0′of the quinones tested ( Doong and
Chiang, 2005 ). Juglone (JQ), naphthoquinone (NQ) and benzoquinone
(BQ) were found to be more effective electron-transfer mediator than
AQDS during the reductive transformation of CT by sul ﬁde. The
reduction rates observed in the presence of JQ and NQ were 10 –14
higher than those obtained with AQDS, despite that the driving force
for CT transformation could be expected to be greater for AQDS than
that for NQ based on the E0′values. Moreover, JQ, NQ and BQ increased
the reduction rate of CT a greater extent compared to the catalyticeffects of AQDS and menadione (MQ), which also contrasts with the
previously reported correlation between the E
0′values and reductive
transformation rates ( Tratnyek et al., 2001; Rau et al., 2002; Doong
and Lai, 2005; Guerrero-Barajas and Field, 2005 ). The last results mean
that the E0′of quinoid RM may not be the only factor that controls the
reduction rate of PCC, and that the chemical structures may play an
important role in determining the reactivity of quinoid compounds
(Doong and Chiang, 2005 ).
The reduction rate of an electron-withdrawing pollutant by a
reduced RM would theoretically increase with decreasing E0′of the
RM; but the reduction rate of the RM by sul ﬁde will decrease with
decreasing E0′. The last observation may explain the lower catalytic
input of AQDS on CT dechlorination, compared to the catalysis
observed with BQ and JQ ( Doong and Chiang, 2005 ). Nevertheless,
according to the same hypothesis, dechlorination of CT would proceed
faster by previously reduced AQDS than by reduced BQ or JQ.
3.2.4. Reactive species involved in reductive dechlorination reactions
Different reactive species including semiquinone, hydroquinone,
and mercaptoquinone have been shown to successfully transfer
electrons from bulk reductants to electron-withdrawing organic
pollutants ( Schwarzenbach et al., 1990; Curtis and Reinhard, 1994;
Perlinger et al., 1996 ). The mechanism of formation of reactive species
during reductive transformation processes has been linked to the
characteristic redox cycling properties of the quinone compounds
(Doong and Chiang, 2005 ).Experimental evidence suggests that the concentration of semi-
quinone radicals, produced during reductive transformations, controls
the rate of conversion of organic pollutants ( Scott et al.,1998; Rau et al.,
2002 ). Further research indicates that the amounts of deprotonated
hydroquinone and semiquinone radicals are correlated to the
degradation ef ﬁciency of priority pollutants in AQDS- and HA-
amended incubations under reducing conditions ( Tratnyek and
Macalady, 1989; Curtis and Reinhard, 1994; Scott et al., 1998 ).
Monophenolate ( Schwarzenbach et al., 1990 ) and mercaptojuglone
(Perlinger et al., 1996 ) have also been identi ﬁed as the dominant
reactive species during reductive transformations mediated by JQ in
the presence of sul ﬁde as electron donor. However, the rate of
degradation of HCA was more speci ﬁcally linked to the production of
mercaptojuglone in its hydroquinone or semiquinone form at different
pH values ( Perlinger et al., 2002 ). A preliminary report elucidated the
mechanism by which JQ might decrease the Ea in dechlorination
reaction with sul ﬁde as electron donor. Mercaptojuglone is the reactive
species readily formed in incubation assays including both sul ﬁde and
JQ (Perlinger et al., 1998 ). Mercaptojuglone enhanced the reductive
dechlorination of different PCC at a higher extent than that expected by
the input of reduced JQ alone ( Perlinger et al., 1998 ).
More recently, results derived from electron paramagnetic reso-
nance, UV –vis spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectro-
scopy of different quinoid RM, clearly showed that three groups of
quinones can be categorized based on the formation of the active
electron-transfer mediators involved in the reductive transformation
of CT ( Doong and Chiang, 2005 ). JQ, BQ and NQ produced
mercaptoquinones as reactive species, which enhanced up to 71-fold
the reduction rate of CT, compared to the control lacking quinones. In
contrast, MQ and LQ, which were reduced to their corresponding
hydroquinone by sul ﬁde, promoted a much lower enhancement on
the reduction rate of CT. Moreover, reduction of AQDS by sul ﬁde
produced semiquinone radicals, which moderately increased the
reduction rate of CT. Therefore, the catalytic effects of different
quinoid RM strongly depends on the type of reactive species produced
during reductive transformation processes. Mercaptoquinone is a
more ef ﬁcient reactive species than either semiquinone radicals or
hydroquinone for transferring electrons in a reducing environment
containing thiol reductants ( Doong and Chiang, 2005 ). The last
observations could explain the remarkably higher dechlorinationrate of CT promoted by LQ, compared to reactions mediated by AQDS,
despite the lower E
0′of the former RM ( Doong and Chiang, 2005 ).
3.2.5. Variety of electron donors and natural sources of RM
Two half-reactions are at stake during reductive dechlorinations
mediated by RM: 1) reduction of redox active groups by a proper
electron donor; and 2) subsequent reductive dechlorination of PCC by
reduced RM ( Fig. 1 ). Therefore, the overall reaction rate depends on
the capacity of the external electron donor to transfer electrons to the
RM and on the ability of the reduced RM to channel the electrons to
PCC. According to the experimental data available in the literature, the
reduction of different RM, by chemical and biological processes,
proceeds generally faster than the subsequent transfer of electrons
from the reduced RM to PCC. For instance, the reduction of AQDS and
HA by sul ﬁde occurs within a few hours ( Dunnivant et al., 1992 ;
Cervantes, unpublished results), whereas reductive dechlorinations of
different PCC by reduced AQDS or HA demand several days of
incubation ( Curtis and Reinhard, 1994; Kappler and Haderlein, 2003;
Cervantes et al., 2004 ). A wide variety of microorganisms, including
iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, halorespiring, fermentative and
methanogenic microorganisms, are also capable of rapidly reducing
HA or quinones, which could then be available to promote reductive
dechlorinations in anaerobic environments ( Field and Cervantes,
2005 ). Ferrous iron is another reductant commonly found in anaerobic
environments, but its reducing capacity is minor compared to sul ﬁde,268 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277which is re ﬂected by the lower dechlorination rates achieved with the
former ( Curtis and Reinhard, 1994 ).
For biologically mediated dechlorinations, glucose, formate and
hydrogen generally promote higher dechlorination rates, compared to
those obtained with methanol and acetate, which agrees with the
faster quinone-reducing activities observed with the former substrates
(Cervantes et al., 2000a,b; 2004; Guerrero-Barajas and Field, 2005 ).
Many different model RM, such as quinoid- and ﬂavin-based
compounds, have a higher solubility compared to natural sources of
RM (e.g. humic materials), which may also imply different catalytic
inputs during reductive dechlorinations. It is conceivable that RM with
a higher solubility could be more easily reduced, either chemically or
biologically, compared to RM remaining suspended on the reaction
system, which in turn would promote faster dechlorination rates. The
last observation explains the higher dechlorination rates generally
achieved with soluble model RM than with suspended NOM
(Schwarzenbach et al., 1990; Dunnivant et al., 1992; Tratnyek et al.,
2001 ). Furthermore, suspended NOM could even inhibit dechlorina-
tion reactions when insoluble electron donors participate in dechlor-
ination reactions. For example, the presence of suspended NOM in
dechlorination assays, with ZVI as an electron donor, decreased the
rate and extent of dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) and PCE
by competitive sorption onto reactive sites of ZVI surface ( Tratnyek
et al., 2001; Doong and Lai, 2005 ). In contrast, different soluble RM,
such as AQDS and LQ, increased the rate and extent of dechlorination
of different PCC by ZVI ( Tratnyek et al., 2001; Doong and Lai, 2005 ).
The content of redox active groups in NOM also plays a role on
determining the catalytic input of RM in dechlorination reactions. For
instance, the reductive transformation of CT by Shewanella putrefa-
ciens 200 was enhanced to a greater extent by HA compared to CT
dechlorination mediated by fulvic acids (FA) ( Collins and Picardal,
1999 ). A larger content of quinones has been reported in HA compared
to FA ( Stevenson, 1994 ), which may explain the last phenomenon.
Nevertheless, despite the inherent variations in concentration,accessibility, and reactivity of redox-active groups in HA originated
from a variety of environments, the capacity of electrochemically
reduced HA to achieve the abiotic dechlorination of PCC was fairly
constant ( Kappler and Haderlein, 2003 ).
4. Role of redox mediators on the reduction of
nitroaromatic pollutants
4.1. Introduction
Mono- and polynitroaromatic compounds (PNACs) are widely used
as agrochemicals, explosives, textile dyes, and as chemical inter-
mediates for different manufacturing sectors. Due to their widespread
use and improper disposal, contamination of soils, sediments and
groundwater by PNACs is a ubiquitous problem. Several reports have
conﬁrmed the toxic and adverse effects of PNACs on biological
ecosystems and on human health. Consequently, the restoration of
PNACs-contaminated sites is a matter of concern among environ-
mental protection groups ( Hofstetter et al., 1999 ).
Tables 8 and 9 recapitulate the experimental data obtained during the
reductive (bio)transformation of PNACs mediated by different RM. Most
reports deal with the abiotic transformation of PNACs illustrating the
catalytic effects of model RM or NOM from different origins ( Table 8 ).
Recently, reductive biotransformation of PNACs by distinct microorgan-
isms has also been reported ( Table 9 ). In this section the input of different
RM on the reductive (bio)transformation of PNACs will be discussed, as
well as the different aspects gov erning the catalytic reactions.
4.2. Main factors determining the input of RM in the reduction of
nitroaromatic pollutants
4.2.1. pH
Several studies have documented the effect of pH during reductive
transformation of PNACs mediated by different redox reactive groups.

Macalady (1989) , who evaluated the capacity of different reduced
quinone moieties to reduce methyl parathion over the pH range
between 5.5 and 9.0. Reduction of this nitroaromatic pesticide by
reduced indigodisulfonate proceeded at the fastest rate at pH around
7.1, but declined rapidly on both sides of this maximum. Similar results
were obtained during the reduction of methyl parathion by AH 2QDS,
but the maximum reduction rate occurred at a pH around 6.0. Further
inspection of the reaction systems, based on E0′–pH diagrams for both
RM, revealed that the concentration of the hydroquinone with one of
the hydroxyl groups dissociated (monophenolate form) is substantial
atE0′/pH conditions at which the highest reduction rate of methyl
parathion occurred. Based on these observations, the authors
developed a connection model between deprotonation of –OH groups
of the RM and the reduction rate of methyl parathion. A high
correlation between the reduction rate of methyl parathion and the
calculated concentration of monophenolate species of both RM wasobtained ( Tratnyek and Macalady, 1989 ).
The same deprotonation model was used by Schwarzenbach et al.
(1990) to describe the effect of pH on the reduction of different PNACs
by sul ﬁde or cysteine, mediated by quinoid RM. The authors proposed
the following equation to calculate the reduction rate of PNACs as a
function of the concentration of the monophenolate ([HQ −]) and
biphenolate ([Q −2]) species of the reduced RM:
k
obs=kHQ−HQ−½/C138 +kQ−2Q−2hi
where kHQ−andkQ−2are the second-order rate constant for the reaction
of the nitroaromatic compound with the hydroquinone monophenolate
and biphenolate, respectively. Non-dissociated hydroquinone species
were negligibly reactive, as compared to the dissociated species, and
therefore were not considered in the equation. Experimental data
revealed that for the 2 quinoid RM evaluated (JQ and LQ), the
biphenolate species was ~500-fold more reactive than the monophe-
nolate species. Thus, pH changes, particularly at pH values above 7, have
a dramatic impact on the reduction rate of PNACs.
Furthermore, a somewhat more complex pH dependence of the
reaction rates was found for the reduction of nitrophenols, as these
compounds are weak acids, and may thus, be present in both the non-
dissociated and the dissociated forms. Evidence indicated that the
non-dissociated species of several nitrophenols studied reacted ~3-
fold faster with the monophenolate form of reduced LQ than their
dissociated species ( Schwarzenbach et al., 1990 ).Similar pH dependence was also observed during the reductive
transformation of 3-chloro-nitrobenzene by sul ﬁde, mediated by
NOM from different origins ( Dunnivant et al., 1992 ), corroborating the
higher reactivity of dissociated quinoid-redox groups in NOM,
compared to that of non-dissociated species.
In a more recent study, the effect of pH on the rate of reduction of
hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) by AH 2QDS was investi-
gated ( Kwon and Finneran, 2008 ). As the pH increased from 6.2 to 9.2
at constant AH 2QDS concentration (100 µM), the reduction rate of RDX
increased 61-fold. Furthermore, the authors found that the reduction
rate of RDX was very closely related to the concentration of the
monophenolate hydroquinone. In addition, results obtained with cell
suspensions of Geobacter metallireducens degrading RDX, showed a
decrease on the reduction rate of this contaminant by raising the pH in
the microbial incubations in the absence of AQDS. Nevertheless, in
AQDS-amended cell incubations of G. metallireducens , the reduction
rate of RDX was signi ﬁcantly increased, compared to the reaction rates
observed without AQDS, but remained similar within the whole pH
range tested (6.8, 7.9 and 9.2) ( Kwon and Finneran, 2008 ).
4.2.2. Redox potential
The reduction of several nitroaromatic pollutants under different
redox conditions has been investigated. The effect of the E0′of a model
system, including the reduced form of either indigodisulfonate or
AQDS, on the rate of reduction of methyl parathion was studied
(Tratnyek and Macalady, 1989 ). Experiments were conducted at a E0′
range between −37 to −208 mV, and −90 to −140 mV, for
indigodisulfonate- and AQDS-supplied incubations, respectively. The
results showed that the reduction rate of the nitroaromatic pesticide
increased as E0′became more negative with both quinones evaluated.
This trend observed is reasonable insofar as a low E0′reﬂects a high
concentration of reduced species in the reaction system, which are
then available to promote the reduction of methyl parathion.
Further studies also revealed a high correlation between the E0′of
the reaction system and the rate of reduction of 3-chloro-nitroben-
zene by different concentrations of sul ﬁde in the presence of different
sources of NOM ( Dunnivant et al., 1992 ). As expected, a more negative
value of E0′, achieved by a higher concentration of sul ﬁde, promoted a
higher reduction rate of the nitroaromatic pollutant. Moreover, the
authors compared the capacity of reduced NOM, obtained by bubbling
hydrogen into platinum-amended solutions, with the incubations
described above. The results indicated slightly lower reduction rates
than those obtained with sul ﬁde, but revealed that reduced functionalTable 9

capable of mediating the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. The
increased reduction rate of 3-chloro-nitrobenzene observed by
increasing the E0′was attributed to the additional reduction of reactive
functional groups in NOM exhibiting a more negative reduction
potential.
The reduction of nitrobenzene by ZVI was explored in the presence
of different RM ( Tratnyek et al., 2001 ). The obtained results also
indicate the in ﬂuence of the E0′on the reaction rate. Indeed, AQDS,
which has a more negative E0′(−184 mV) than LQ ( −137 mV),
promoted a higher reduction rate of nitrobenzene than the latter RM.
4.2.3. Biodegradation pathway
Although limited studies have been conducted to elucidate the
impact of RM on the reduction of PNACs by microorganisms, the
literature reveals that RM not only accelerate the reduction of PNACs,
but also have a remarkable effect on the biodegradation pathway
(Borch et al., 2005; Bhushan et al., 2006; Kwon and Finneran, 2006;
Kwon and Finneran, 2008 ).The reduction rate of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) by Cellulomonas
sp. strain ES6 was increased up to 3.6-fold by the addition of different
concentrations of AQDS (10 –1000 µM, ( Borch et al., 2005 ). Hydro-
xylaminodinitrotoluenes, 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-
DHANT), and tetranitroazoxytoluenes were the major metabolites
observed in pure cultures of strain ES6 in the absence of AQDS. The
presence of AQDS promoted the rapid initial formation of arylhydrox-ylamines, such as 2,4-DHANT, which were further transformed into
several unidenti ﬁed polar products. Moreover, results obtained in the
presence of strain ES6, ferrihydrite and 100 µM AQDS showed further
alterations on the TNT biodegradation pathway. Increased reduction
rates of 4-hydroxyaminodinitrotoluene (2-HADNT) and 4-aminodini-
trotoluene (4-ADNT) to 2,4-diaminonitrotoluene (2,4-DANT) were
observed (Steps 1.1, 6 and 8, Fig. 3 ). Only traces of 2-HADNT and 2,4-
DHANT were observed, whereas 2,4-DANT accounted for up to 79% of
the mass balance at the end of the incubation period (70 h). The input
of AQDS on ferrihydrite-amended cultures was explained by an
increased concentration of surface-associated redox active Fe(II),
promoted by AQDS, which then enhanced the Fe(II)-mediated TNT
reduction ( Borch et al., 2005 ).
Fig. 3. Pathways and metabolites observed during the AQDS-mediated degradation of TNT by Cellulomonas sp. strain ES6 (after Borch et al., 2005 ).271 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277The catalytic effects of HA and AQDS on the biodegradation of
hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-
tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) by Clostridium sp. strain EDB2
was studied ( Bhushan et al., 2006 ). The experimental data revealed
that the presence of either HA or AQDS, in cell suspensions of strain
EDB2 degrading these cyclic nitramines, not only increased the
biotransformation rates, but also the extent of mineralization ofboth pollutants. Up to 40% of uniformly labeled
14C-RDX (150 µM) was
mineralized to14CO2when microbial incubations were performed in
the presence of HA or AQDS; whereas only 28% of mineralization
occurred in the absence of RM after 45 days of incubation. Moreover,
of the initial amount of uniformly labeled14C-HMX (55 µM) added to
microbial incubations of strain EDB2, only 5% was mineralized to
14CO2in the absence of RM, while 22% of mineralization was detected
in both HA- and AQDS-amended cultures ( Bhushan et al., 2006 ).
In a recent study, the impact of AQDS on the biodegradation of RDX
byG. metallireducens was evaluated ( Kwon and Finneran, 2008 ). In
abiotic incubations including AH 2QDS as a sole electron donor, for the
reduction of uniformly labeled14C-RDX, the main products obtained
were methylenedinitramine (MEDINA), formaldehyde, nitrous oxide,
nitrite and ammonium, but no14CO2was detected. During the
incubation of G. metallireducens in the absence of AQDS, formaldehyde
was the primary carbon metabolite produced and hexahydro-1-
nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX) did not accumulate. How-
ever, MEDINA was less signi ﬁcant compared to the level detected in
abiotic conditions; whereas ammonium appeared as the main
nitrogenous product. The reduction of RDX by G. metallireducens was
signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of AQDS and formaldehyde and
MEDINA were concurrently produced; however, MEDINA was further
metabolized leading to a greater extent of mineralization evidenced
by a higher production of14CO2(Kwon and Finneran, 2008 ).
5. Role of redox mediators in miscellaneous processes
5.1. Introduction
The reactions dealt with so far were all reductive (bio)transforma-
tions of organic pollutants, and RM-catalysis of these reactions was
based on a mostly extracellular reaction between a chemically or
biologically reduced mediator with the organic electron-accepting
pollutant. A similar mechanism is responsible for RM-catalysis of the
reduction of vat and anthraquinone dyes (Section 5.2). RM may also
play a role in the biological reduction of (bulk) inorganic electron
acceptors such as nitrate, perchlorate and arsenate, through a
mechanism that involves biological oxidation instead of reduction of
the external RM (Section 5.2). In addition, there are other types of both
biological and chemical oxidation –reduction processes that depend
on or are accelerated by redox mediators. Important examples of such
processes are the (dissimilatory) reduction of oxidized metal minerals
(e.g. ferric iron) and anode reduction in microbial fuel cells (MFC),
where RM serve to facilitate the transport of electrons respectively
from and to solid materials (Section 5.3). Moreover, inversely
analogous to anode reduction, also cathode oxidation can be catalyzed
by RM (Section 5.4). Another type of processes that can be accelerated
by RM is the chemical or biological oxidation of bulk reductants suchas sul ﬁde (Section 5.5). Furthermore, RM are known to catalyze
enzymatic oxidation of organic compounds (Section 5.6). Most of
these RM-catalyzed processes are beyond the scope of this paper and
have already received ample attention in other review articles. In the
sections below we will only brie ﬂy discuss these topics, wherever
possible with reference to relevant review papers.
5.2. Reduction of vat and anthraquinone dyes
Redox mediators have been shown to accelerate the reduction of
two classes of non-azo dyes, vat dyes and anthraquinone dyes. Theprinciple of vat dyeing is sequential reduction and oxidation. In the
reduction step, vat dyes such as indigo are solubilized (and often
decolorized), and in the consecutive oxidation step, the dyes regain
their color and precipitate on the fabric. It has been demonstrated that
quinones can speed up the chemical reduction of vat dyes by
dithionite ( Roessler et al., 2003 ), as well as electrochemical vat dye
reduction ( Roessler and Jin, 2003 ). Moreover, it has been shown that
the reductive decolorization of an anthraquinone dye by mesophilic
anaerobic sludge can be accelerated by quinones ( Bisschops et al.,
2005; Dos Santos et al., 2005a ). Both types of dyes are structures with
quinone moieties, and their decolorization is presumably a result of
the reduction of quinone to hydroquinone. Although this reaction can
be assumed reversible once the dyes are again exposed to oxygen
(Seignez et al., 1996 ), the results of studies to anaerobic treatment of
anthraquinone dyes normally point at irreversible reduction ( Fontenot
et al., 2002; Dos Santos et al., 2005a ).
5.3. Reduction of soluble inorganic electron acceptors
A small number of papers mention a role of RM in the reduction of
soluble inorganic electron acceptors, i.e. ‘normal ’electron acceptors
such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate, as well as less usual electron
acceptors such as perchlorate and selenite. The reduction of some of
these electron acceptors can be a purely chemical reaction (e.g.
chemical sul ﬁde oxidation by oxygen) but most electron acceptors
exclusively require biotransformation for their reduction, coupled to
the oxidation of primary electron donors. A crucial difference with the
reductive biotransformation reactions dealt with so far is that the
biological reduction of these soluble inorganic electron acceptors
typically requires their uptake by the cells. As most external RM do not
cross cell membranes, they are not likely to play a role in shuttling
electrons directly to these electron acceptors. RM may only play a role
in accelerating these reductions by transporting electrons to the cells.
It has been established that many facultative anaerobes can capture
electrons from chemically reduced AQDS (AH
2QDS) to respire oxygen
and nitrate, but not Fe(III), Mn(IV) and elemental sulfur ( Coates et al.,
2002 ). In this study, AH 2QDS was not added as a mediator, but as a
bulk electron donor in the absence of an intrinsic mechanism of AQDS
reduction. In other studies, an (electro)chemical source of electrons
was available, enabling RM to shuttle electron from this source to the
cell. AQDS has been successfully applied in bioelectric perchlorate
reduction to shuttle electrons from a cathode to the dissimilatory
perchlorate reducing bacteria Dechloromonas and Azospira (Thrash
et al., 2007 ). Likewise, it has been observed that 1,2-naphthoquinone-
4-sulfonate stimulates the simultaneous removal of sul ﬁde and
nitrate, possibly by facilitating the transfer electrons from sul ﬁde to
denitrifying bacteria ( Aranda-Tamaura et al., 2007 ). In the absence of
either an electrochemical source of electrons or a bulk reductant that
reacts directly with the mediator, evidence for a role of RM is very
limited. The observation that arsenate (As(V)) reduction by lactate-fed
anaerobic granular sludge was somewhat accelerated by AQDS ( Field
et al., 2004 ) may have been related to AQDS reduction coupled to
lactate oxidation followed by the use of AH 2QDS as electron donor for
arsenate-reducing bacteria. These results contrast the observation
that AQDS had no effect on the reduction of arsenate by VFA-fed
anaerobic sludge in continuous packed-column reactors ( Sierra-
Alvarez et al., 2005 ). Another study reported an accelerating effect
of AQDS in combination with yeast extract on the reduction of selenite
(Se(IV)) to insoluble selenium (Se0) by glucose-fed Enterobacter
taylorae . In contrast, AQDS did not affect the rate of the reduction of
selenate (Se(VI)) to Se(IV). The different results regarding the effect of
AQDS on the two steps of Se(IV) reduction were attributed to redox
potential differences between the couples involved ( Zhang et al.,
2007 ) but it may also have been due to the location of the reaction,
with AQDS only able to interfere with Se(IV) reduction. It has been
pointed out that, in order to avoid intracellular precipitation of272 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277insoluble products (in this case Se0), bacteria are more likely to use an
exocellular respiratory mechanism ( Gralnick and Newman, 2007 ).
5.4. Reduction of insoluble materials (minerals and anodes)
Microbial processes depending on the transfer of electrons to solid
electron acceptors present a highly relevant category of oxidation –
reduction reactions with a signi ﬁcant role of RM. These involve the
reduction of insoluble metal oxides, e.g. dissimilatory Fe(III)- and Mn
(IV)-reduction, and anode reduction for electricity generation in
microbial fuel cells (MFC). These processes have been the subject of a
large number of research papers, and the mechanism of extracellular
electron transfer, which is largely similar in both processes, has
received ample attention and several review articles have been
published, some of them mainly focused on respiration of minerals
(Newman, 2001 ), others exclusively on MFC ( Rabaey and Verstraete,
2005; Bullen et al., 2006; Logan et al., 2006; Lovley, 2006; Davis and
Higson, 2007; Du et al., 2007; Schröder, 2007 ), others on both ( Stams
et al., 2006; Gralnick and Newman, 2007 ). For the transfer of electrons
from the oxidation of primary substrates by bacteria to either oxidized
metal minerals or the anode surface, one can distinguish between
direct and mediated electron transfer (DET and MET, respectively).DET is based on membrane-bound enzymes and direct physical
contact of the cell membrane or a membrane organelle (electropili)
with the solid electron acceptor. In contrast, MET depends on RM,
either externally added compounds such as AQS or shuttling
compounds produced by the bacteria themselves, such as phenazines.
In addition, in MFC an in-between category of electron transfer that
has been alternately ranged under DET or MET, uses non-diffusive
mediators immobilized on the anode surface. It is interesting to note
the entanglement that may arise from the concepts: whereas the
presence of RM is not an exclusive prerequisite for electricity
generation, it may very well be that the mechanism of electron
transfer in so-called ‘mediator-less ’MFCs depends (partly) on biogenic
diffusive mediators. Moreover, stimulation of electricity production by
non-diffusive mediators on the electrode surface still requires a DET or
MET reduction mechanism.
Several metal-reducing bacteria, such as species of Geobacter ,She-
wanella andRhodoferax , are capable of DET via c-type cytochromes, and
it has recently been demonstrated that at least some of them (e.g. Geo-
bacter sulfurreducens and S. putrefaciens ) have the additional quality of
forming electrically conductive pili or nanowires that enable them to
reach electron-accepting surfaces at a certain distance from the cell
(Reguera et al., 2005; Gorby et al., 2006 ). The other mechanism of
electron transfer, ‘self-mediated ’MET via biogenic RM, is also receiving
growing attention. It has been shown that Pseudomonas auruginosa
produces pycocyanine and phenazine-1-carboxamide as RM ( Rabaey
et al., 2005 ). Moreover, recent evidence showed that several Shewanella
species excrete the ﬂavins ribo ﬂavin and FMN that serve as RM in
electron transfer reaction ( Marsili et al., 2008; Von Canstein et al., 2008 ).
As several RM have lower redox potentials than the cytochromes
responsible for DET, it has been pointed out that the amount of
extractable electric energy can be higher with MET than with DET
(Schröder, 2007 ). An important drawback of MET, however, is that
diffusive mediators (either externally added or endogenously produced)may easily be lost from continuous ﬂow systems such as MFC.
5.5. Electron transfer from cathodes
Whereas RM can be involved in transferring electrons to fuel cell
anodes, they also can facilitate the transfer of electrons from fuel cell
cathodes to terminal electron acceptors. Especially mediated electro-
chemical cathodic reduction of oxygen to superoxide and peroxide hasbeen thoroughly investigated, as summarized in the review article by
Šljukic et al. (2005) . In addition, RM have been used to shuttle
electrons from cathodes to bacteria, either for the reduction ofelectron accepting components such as TCE ( Aulenta et al., 2007 )
perchlorate ( Thrash et al., 2007 ) and sulfate ( Kim et al., 1990 ), or for
manipulating product formation of fermentative conversions such as
glucose fermentation to propionate by a Propionibacterium species
(Emde and Schink, 1990 ) or to butanol by Clostridium acetobutylicum
(Peguin and Soucaille, 1996 ). In analogy to anodic reduction, cathodic
oxidation can be based on MET as well as on DET. A recent reviewarticle on Bioelectrical Reactors (BER) provides an adequate summary
of electrically stimulated biotransformation reactions and the
mechanisms of electron transfer ( Thrash and Coates, 2008 ).
5.6. Sul ﬁde oxidation
While the redox couple sul ﬁde/sulfur(polysul ﬁde) is a potential
electron shuttle in biotransformation reactions, e.g. reductive deha-
logenation ( De Wever et al., 2000 ), the oxidation of sul ﬁde itself may
be affected by external RM. It has been demonstrated that dissolved
organic matter (DOM, peat humic acid) plays a redox-active role in
sulﬁde cycling ( Heitmann and Blodau, 2006; Blodau et al., 2007;
Heitmann et al., 2007 ). It was also observed that the presence of DOM
affects the way sul ﬁde is oxidized, with thiosulfate rather than
elemental sulfur or polysul ﬁde as the main reaction products
(Heitmann and Blodau, 2006; Heitmann et al., 2007 ). Furthermore,
some chemical sul ﬁde oxidation processes in practice, so-called ‘liquid
redox processes ’, use catalysts ( Dalrymple et al., 1989 ). For example, in
the Stretfort process, sul ﬁde is oxidized by oxidized transition metals
that are regenerated by organic RM that eventually shuttle electrons
to oxygen ( Steudel,1996 ). Moreover, activated carbon, which is known
to act as RM in azo dye reduction ( Van der Zee et al., 2003; Mezohegyi
et al., 2007 ) is also known to catalyze the reaction between sul ﬁde and
oxygen ( Choi et al., 1991; Dalai et al., 1999 ). In this case, however, it is
unknown whether an electron shuttling mechanism is involved or
whether it is merely surface-catalysis.
5.7. Enzymatic oxidation of organic compounds
Several oxidative enzymes, especially laccases and peroxidases,
show higher activity or depend on RM for the oxidation of wide array of
organic substrates. Typical RM of these kind of enzymes are e.g. veratryl
alcohol (3,4-dimethoxy benzyl alcohol) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole,
logically compounds with a higher E
0′than the RM in reductive
biotransformation reactions. A recent review paper on this topic
provides a comprehensive summary ( Husain and Husain, 2008 ).
6. Future perspectives on the application of redox mediators on
the reductive (bio)transformation of contaminants
6.1. Introduction
There certainly are great potentials for the application of RM on the
reductive (bio)transformation of several priority pollutants both in
contaminated groundwater and in wastewaters originated from
different industrial sectors. Nonetheless, to warrant a successful
output of the application of RM, several important topics should be
considered in future research. The purpose of this section is to
underline the main research areas demanded to enhance the
applicability of RM in aquifer restoration and wastewater treatment.
6.2. Cost-effective sources of redox active groups
Several redox active groups have been reported to play a signi ﬁcant
role in the reductive (bio)transformation of priority pollutants. The large
list of redox active molecules includes cytochromes ( Picardal et al., 1993 ),
ﬂavines ( Guerrero-Barajas and Field, 2005 ), cobalamins ( Zou et al., 2000 ),
porphyrins ( Koons et al., 2001 ), pyridines ( Lee et al., 1999 ), phenazines
(Hernandez et al., 2004 ) and quinones ( Field and Cervantes, 2005 ).273 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277Quinones, active functional groups in humus, have been proposed
as the most appropriate RM for the reductive (bio)transformation of a
number of priority pollutants ( Field and Cervantes, 2005 ). The main
reason for considering quinones for redox (bio)transformation
processes is that they are very abundant in humus, the most plentiful
and cheaply available organic source in the biosphere. Moreover, the
remarkable stability of HS in the environment, evidenced by theirlarge residence time ( N500 years) ( Stevenson, 1994 ), prevents the
deterioration of this material during bioremediation processes.
Furthermore, humus is generally considered as a non-hazardous
material and does not lead to the production of toxic byproducts
(Perminova et al., 2005 ).
However, to take advantage of this abundant source of RM, careful
selection of the origin of the humic material should be undertaken.
Certainly, the ECC of several HS from a variety of origins was
quanti ﬁed (Ratasuk and Nanny, 2007 ). Highly aliphatic FA and HA
extracted from different land ﬁll leachates did not have any ECC and
therefore are not recommended as a suitable source for RM. In
contrast, FA and HA originated from peat, river sediments or soils
showed an ECC ranging from 25 up to 538 micro-equivalents per g HS
at different pH values.
6.3. Engineered HS for their application as RM in redox reactions
As underlined by Perminova et al. (2005) , the principal factor
limiting the application of HS in remediation technologies is the
intrinsic variability in redox properties observed among humic
materials and their fractions. Therefore, engineered humic materials
are demanded in order to accomplish the redox mediating properties
required during the conversion of a large number of priority
pollutants through redox reactions.
Quinoid-enriched humic materials with enhanced redox proper-
ties were synthesized by two different strategies ( Perminova et al.,
2005 ). The ﬁrst approach was related to the oxidation of phenolic
fractions associated with the humic aromatic core. In a second
strategy, polycondensation of these phenolic fragments was carried
out with hydroquinone and catechol. Redox characterization of the
copolymers obtained revealed that the reducing capacity of this
synthesized humic material ranged between 1 and 4 mmol/g, which
was much higher than the parent materials and the oxidized
derivatives. Therefore, preferential application of the copolyconden-
sation approach was advised.
Water soluble sulfonated humic materials were produced from
leonardite and peat in order to evaluate their metal-binding capacity
for Fe(III) and Hg(II) ( Yudov et al., 2005 ). Enrichment of HA with
sulfonate groups was postulated as an approach for remediation
techniques applied during heavy metals removal from contaminated
sites. The solubility of metal –HA complexes was estimated as an
amount of strong metal-binding sites (SBS) in the humic materials.
The sulfonated materials were characterized by a 2-fold increase in
the amount of SBS compared to the parent materials. The enhanced
solubility achieved in HA by this strategy may also be useful to
distribute redox active groups of HA in contaminated aquifers for
restoration purposes.
Different humic derivatives have also been synthesized and
immobilized in silica gel to enhance their applicability in remediation
technologies based on reactive barriers ( Perminova et al., 2007 ).
Nevertheless, considering the wide variety of redox reactions in which
HS could be demanded, further research is required in order to obtain
engineered HS, which ful ﬁll different redox characteristics.
6.4. Immobilization of RM
Quinoid RM not necessarily have to be supplied abundantly in
bioremediation processes to accelerate the redox transformation of
different contaminants, as they are being recycled during the transferof electron from an electron donor to the terminal electron acceptor
(Fig. 1 ). However, continuous addition of RM should be supplied in
anaerobic bioreactors in order to achieve increased conversion rates,
which raise the costs of treatment.
An approach to eliminate the prerequisite of continuous supply of
RM is to create a niche for their immobilization in anaerobic
bioreactors. However, scarce attempts to apply immobilized quinoidRM for the anaerobic conversion of priority pollutants have been
reported. One of the alternatives available considers the application of
activated carbon (AC) as a natural source of quinoid RM and its
potential for reducing azo dyes have been explored in anaerobic
bioreactors ( Van der Zee et al., 2003 ). An AC-amended bioreactor
performed a higher decolorizing capacity ( N90% of decolorization)
compared to a bioreactor control lacking AC ( b40% of decolorization)
during the reductive decolorization of RR2. Evidence indicated that
the redox mediating capacity of AC was the main cause of the
enhanced decolorization observed as the improved RR2 removal
observed was 121-fold higher than the adsorption capacity of the AC.
However, the catalytic effects of AC gradually decrease attributed to its
continuing wash-out from the reactor. More recently, an up ﬂow
packed-bed reactor (UPBR) containing biological AC was tested for the
continuous decolorization of AO7 ( Mezohegyi et al., 2007 ). The
treatment system achieved high decolorization ef ﬁciency of AO7 at
very short space times: up to 99% decolorization in 2 min. Thus, the
UPBR seems to be a promising system for anaerobic redox conver-
sions, but needs to be proved with more recalcitrant pollutants.
Another immobilizing approach reported is to insert quinoid RM
within different materials through polymerization procedures ( Guo
et al., 2007 ). Through this immobilizing technique, quinoid RM remain
entrapped within the synthesized polymer keeping their redox
mediating capacity. In this study, anthraquinone (AQ) entrapped in
calcium alginate promoted up to 2-fold increase on the rate of
decolorization of different azo dyes by a salt-tolerant bacterial culture,
compared to controls lacking AQ. Disadvantages of this strategy are: 1)
mass transfer limitations since a major part of the RM is embedded
within the polymeric material making its accessibility dependent on
diffusion; 2) gradual lost of redox catalysts due to disruption of the
polymeric material owing to weak mechanical strength of the
materials explored.
Lately, functionalized polypyrrole (PPy) composites were enriched
with AQDS during the electropolymerization of pyrrole monomer on
activated carbon felt (ACF) electrode. The resulting composite (ACF/
PPy/AQDS) was tested as a RM for the reductive biotransformation of
nitroaromatic compounds ( Li et al., 2008 ). This study showed that
ACF/PPy/AQDS exhibited good catalytic activity and stability and its
addition effectively accelerated the reductive transformation of
different nitroaromatic pollutants by an anaerobic consortium. Thus,
this strategy represents a promising tool to immobilize RM for
remediation technologies.
6.5. Overcoming limitations during catalysis involving RM
As discussed in the present review, the catalytic effects of RM
greatly ﬂuctuate among the different redox reactions studied so far.
On one hand, the literature provides plentiful information document-
ing the enhancement of redox reactions involved during the (bio)
transformation of several organic and inorganic pollutants in which
the rate of conversion increased several orders of magnitude. On the
other hand, several studies evidenced inhibitory effects of HS during
the reductive (bio)transformation of electron-withdrawing contami-
nants. For instance, abiotic incubations amended with different
concentrations of HA showed a decrease of up to 50% on the reduction
rate of NB, TCE and CT by ZVI, compared to controls incubated in the
absence of HA ( Tratnyek et al., 2001 ). The inhibitory effects of HA were
attributed to competitive sorption of HA onto reactive sites of ZVI
limiting the transfer of electrons between this electron donor and the274 F.P. Van der Zee, F.J. Cervantes / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 256 –277electron-withdrawing pollutants. The last scenario was also observed
during the reductive transformation of PCE ( Doong and Lai, 2005 ) and
2,6-DNAH ( Keum and Li, 2004 ) by ZVI in which HA amendments
caused a decrease of up to 10-fold on the rate of reduction of these
contaminants compared to controls lacking HA.
Not only HA, but also model quinoid RM, such as AQDS, have also
inhibited the reductive conversion of electron-withdrawing contami-nants. Indeed, the microbial dechlorination of 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorobiphenyl
by a bacterial enrichment culture was completely inhibited by the addition
of HA or AQDS by non-clari ﬁed mechanisms ( Cutter et al., 1998 ).
Furthermore, AQDS addition to a methanogenic enrichment culture
promoted a higher reduction rate of FeOOH, but decreased both the rate of
dechlorination of pentachloroaniline and methanogenesis probably due to
competition among these processes for the reducing equivalents available
in the incubations ( Okutman Tas and Pavlostathis, 2007 ).
The information available in the literature provides a broad
perspective of the different experimental conditions (pH, tempera-
ture, type and concentration of RM, type and concentration of electron
donor, and redox potential), which affect the catalytic impact of RM.
However, scarce information has been reported to elucidate the
mechanisms by which RM are involved in different redox reactions
and the bottlenecks to consider during redox catalysis. In some cases,
the reduction of RM by different microorganisms has been pointed out
as the rate-limiting step during redox reactions ( Rau et al., 2002 ). In
contrast, other studies evidenced that the reduction of oxidized
contaminants by reduced RM is the rate-limiting step ( Rau et al., 2002;
Jiang and Kappler, 2008 ). Therefore, further research is demanded in
order to elucidate the mechanisms limiting the catalytic effects of RM
during the anaerobic (bio)transformation of priority pollutants.
