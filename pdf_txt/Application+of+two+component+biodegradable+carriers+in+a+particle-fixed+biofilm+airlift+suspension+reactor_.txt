Abstract A mathematical model of the biological pro-
cess occurring in a modiﬁed bioﬁlm airlift suspension
reactor is presented. When compared with a traditional
wastewater treatment plant, a bioﬁlm airlift suspension
process has major advantages, such as higher oxygen levels
in the bulk ﬂuid and lower space requirements. The limited
volumes obtained with this technique generally do not
allow to reach the high times of contact required for an
efﬁcient removal of nitrogen that normally are character-
ized by a slower kinetics than carbonaceous compounds.
To avoid this problem, supports for attached biomass
growth were inserted in the reactor. Both physical and
biological aspects were incorporated into the presented
model to simulate the removal processes of the substrates.
A sensitivity analysis was performed, and the model was
validated using experimental results obtained at a lab-scale
plant. This model can accurately estimate the removal rate
in different boundary conditions providing the details of
the water quality proﬁles through the reactor and in theattached biomass. The model thus represents a valid aid for
design purposes and for the management of treatment
plants that use these uncommon reactors. The model also
provides the required hydraulic retention time for a com-
plete nitriﬁcation and the appropriate recirculation ratio.
The results have shown the full-scale applicability of this
treatment due to its efﬁciencies coupled to the advantages
of its low impact, low space requirement and low sludge
production.

Introduction
Bioﬁlm reactors can be applied in conditions, where the
reactor efﬁciency, obtained using only freely suspended
organisms, is limited by the biomass concentration and by
short hydraulic residence time. Cases can be encountered
either for slow-growing organisms (e.g., nitriﬁers and
de-nitriﬁers), whose growth in suspension requires long
residence times, or diluted feed streams (a situation fre-
quently found in domestic wastewater treatment pro-
cesses), in which only very low biomass concentrations can
be achieved without biomass retention (Nicolella et al.
2000 ; De Feo 2007 ). In these cases, bioﬁlms can represent
an effective solution to successfully retain biomass in the
reactors and to improve the volumetric conversion capacity
(Nicolella et al. 1998 ; Splendiani et al. 2006 ). Several
technologies at low space requirement based on the bio-
ﬁlms have been developed as alternatives to the traditional
wastewater treatment (Nicolella et al. 2000 ; Akhbari et al.

Author's personal copy2012 ). In recent years, many of these technologies have
been tested and applied, mainly for the industrial waste-
water, to pilot and full-scale plants. The importance of
developing new technologies also in the civil ﬁeld is linkedto the high space requirements of conventional treatment
plants (mainly activated sludge systems) and to the related
high impacts on populations in terms of noise and odoursproduction (Walter et al. 2005 ). Airlift technology reactors
represent a potential solution, where the high oxygen levels
in the stream assure both high efﬁciencies and low odour
impact. However, the design and management of these less
common treatment plants can require a numerical tool ableto analyze and control the different processes involved. At
the beginning of the 1970s, several mathematical models
were developed to link the substrate ﬂux into the bioﬁlm tothe fundamental mechanisms of substrate utilisation and
mass transport (Harremoe ¨s1976 ; La Motta and Mulcahy
1978 ; Williamson and Mc Carty 1976 ; Rittmann and
McCarty 1980 ). The main goal (aim) of these ﬁrst-gener-
ation mechanistic models was to describe the mass ﬂux into
the bioﬁlm and the concentration proﬁle of one rate-lim-iting substrate within the bioﬁlm (Wanner et al. 2006 ).
Later, the bioﬁlm models evolved from one-dimensional
spatial models to multidimensional models, from singlespecies models to multispecies models, from steady-state
models (Mudliar et al. 2008 ) to dynamical models (Russo
et al. 2008 ), and from pure growth models to models
involving biomass growth (Jiang et al. 2009 ; Rahman et al.
2009 ) and bioﬁlm–ﬂuid interactions, etc. (Wang and Zhang
2010 ). Empirical models for the evaluation of the overall
reactor performance have been reconsidered in recent years
(Wang et al. 2006 ; Piciorenau et al. 2004 ). Bioﬁlms are
complex systems, therefore, a bioﬁlm model that attemptsto consider all the complexities should include: (i) mass
balance equations for all of the processes occurring, for all
components, in all compartments, (ii) continuity andmomentum equations for the ﬂuid in all compartments, and
(iii) deﬁned conditions for all variables at all system
boundaries. However, even the most complex bioﬁlmmodels existing today contain many simplifying assump-
tions, because of the difﬁculties in applying this approach
to all the system components. Actually, a model should beas simple as possible, and only as complex as needed
(Wanner et al. 2006 ); especially, when it is not used to
verify theoretical or experimental ﬁndings, but to makequalitative and quantitative predictions that might well
serve as guidelines for several aspects of design (Wang and
Zhang 2010 ). If the objective is then to describe the per-
formance at the macro-scale, a detailed analysis at the
micro-scale could be redundant (Wanner et al. 2006 ;
Morgenroth et al. 2004 ). The use of a simple model for
engineering purposes is also fundamental in the design of
technologies that cannot be represented through a simplecompletely mixed reactor approach. This could signiﬁ-
cantly enhance the use of numerical models for the design
of more efﬁcient or innovative domestic sewages treat-
ments (Noguera et al. 1999 ). The reactor here presented is
designed on the basis of the traditional deep shaft tech-
nology, but the addition of ﬁxed supports for the attached
biomass growth is also considered to achieve higherremoval efﬁciency. The main objective of this work is to
provide a tool for the design and management, on a full
scale, of the combination of the two technologies (i.e.,
bioﬁlm airlift suspension reactor (BAS) and attached bio-
mass). A three substrate-limiting model is implemented.Simpliﬁcations and assumptions, supported by experi-
mental observation were used as shown below (Noguera
et al. 1999 , Wang and Zhang 2010 , Beyenal and Lewan-
dowski 2005 ). The model has been developed through
experiments performed on a plant at lab scale and also with
a sensitivity analysis. The research was developed at theDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the
University of Rome ‘‘La Sapienza’’ in 2009–2010.
Materials and methods
The technological scheme
The modiﬁed BAS reactor here modelled originates from
a typical deep shaft reactor (30–40 m deep, diameter
B1 m) where an airlift is used to raise the wastewater up.
The characteristic short residence times of these systemshave suggested the inclusion of an attached biomass sec-
tion to increase the sludge retention time, ensuring that the
slowest processes will occur (e.g., nitriﬁcation–denitriﬁ-cation). The core of the biological treatment is thus an
attached biomass section, where biomass is allowed to
grow on a support constituted of rough tubular pipes,while dedicated diffusers, at different depths, assure the
needed oxygen distribution through insufﬂated air. The
suspended biomass, mainly concentrated in the deepestsection of the reactor allows for a further carbonaceous
substrate removal before the sludge is raised up and sep-
arated in a ﬂotation section. This scheme thus, combinesthe advantages of the attached biomass systems with those
derived from the adopted high pressure technique (i.e., the
high dissolved oxygen concentrations that in many casesrepresents a limiting factor in conventional treatment
processes). The solid separation by ﬂotation allows for a
further increase in the efﬂuent quality. Finally, the pro-posed scheme allows a lower sludge production and a
reduction of odours impacts as a consequence of the
higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. A numericalmodel was implemented to simulate this modiﬁed BAS,
whose layout is shown in Fig. 1.Int. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.

Author's personal copyExperimental set-up for model validation
The validation of the proposed model was carried out using
the experimental results derived from several experiments
performed on a plant at lab scale (Fig. 5) that are explained
in detail in Luciano et al. ( 2012 ). The main characteristics
of the experimental scheme includes:
a. a mixed homogenisation tank (DT);
b. two attached-biomass aerated reactors in series (AB1
and AB2), reproducing the upper part of the modiﬁed
BAS system (working at 2 bar);
c. a suspended biomass (SB) high-pressure reactor (able
to work at 2–5 bar), equipped with air diffusers,
reproducing the deeper part of the modiﬁed BAS (heresuspended biomasses are considered for completing
the treatment) where the pressure effects on biomass
was investigated;
d. a ﬂotation tank for the solids separation of the reactor
outﬂow (FT).
The numerical model was validated by considering the
results obtained in the AB1 and AB2 reactors which rep-
resent the core of the treatment. Domestic wastewater
derived from a treatment plant in Rome, collected after the
grit removal section, was used as the feed
(COD =590–610 mgL
-1; BOD5 =328–340 mgL-1;
TN=31–66 mgL-1; BOD 5/N=5–10). The entire
experiment lasted 83 days for a total of 15 runs. The
microbial consortium was withdrawn from a conventionalactivated sludge (CAS) process and slowly acclimatized to
let it grow and develop on the rough pipes supports. pH and
temperature were continuously monitored in the experi-ments. Variations of these two parameters were considerednot signiﬁcant as pH ranged between 7 and 8 while tem-
perature in the lab experiments was maintained at room
temperature (approximately 20 /C176C).
Each run consisted of the following steps: (1) the feed
stream was spiked with the substrate, (2) the system was
run for a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 h, and
samples were collected every hour, (3) the system has beenemptied and re-ﬁlled for the following run. The bioﬁlm
thickness was continuously measured with a microscope
using removable supports inserted at different heights inthe reactor. The COD, N–NH
4?,N O 3–,N O 2–, and SS were
determined according to standard methods (Eaton et al.
2005 ).
The numerical framework
The developed model was used to evaluate the overall
removal efﬁciencies on the COD and nitrogen. Different
authors have evidenced that sophisticated approaches areoften not useful for the scale-up of the processes investi-
gated at lab scale (Pizarro et al. 2001 ; Beyenal and
Lewandowski 2005 ). Beyenal and Lewandowski ( 2005 )
reported that the use of a scheme based on a homoge-
neous—bioﬁlm model ignores structural bioﬁlm effects,
but can be veriﬁed experimentally, whereas, heterogeneousbioﬁlm models include the importance of bioﬁlm structure,
but are difﬁcult to verify experimentally.
The biological model here presented is substantially
based on:
– a ﬂux model in the reactor that considers that, under
steady-state conditions, the transport of the substrate
occurs thanks to the convective–diffusive phenomena;

schemeInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.
123
Author's personal copy– a bioﬁlm model that is able to evaluate the substrate
utilisation rate (Saravanan and Sreekrishnan 2006 ),
considering the transport resistances from the liquid
phase to the liquid–bioﬁlm interface (external mass
transport) and the transport from the interface to theactive sites of the bioﬁlm (internal mass transport).
By integrating the set of partial differential equations, it
is possible to obtain the substrates concentration proﬁleswithin the bioﬁlm and the substrate concentrations over the
reactor depth. Furthermore, knowing the amount of dis-
solved oxygen consumed and taking into consideration thediffusional resistances, the anoxic zone in the bioﬁlm
structure can be identiﬁed. By determining the thickness of
the anoxic zones, it is possible to assess the effects of thedenitriﬁcation process on the nitrates concentration. A ﬂow
chart of the model is shown in Fig. 2.
The model also takes into consideration the ratio
between the microorganisms that use carbonaceous sub-
strate ( X
C) and the nitrifying microorganisms ( XN) at the
different depths in the reactor by means of an empirical lawderived from literature data (Matsumoto et al. 2007 ; Pao-
lini 1988 ). The composition of the substrate (e.g., the
carbon concentration expressed by the C:N ratio) has aconsiderable inﬂuence on the nitriﬁcation (Walter et al.
2005 ; Seixo et al. 2004 ).

The ﬁnite difference approach (FDT) here adopted is
appropriate for the hypothesized homogeneous bioﬁlm.
More complicated mechanisms do not provide additional
advantages as report by Pizarro et al. ( 2001 ), who consider
that cellular automata models (i.e., the most frequently
used for modeling the evolution of bioﬁlm structure) do not
have other signiﬁcant advantages over FDT models whenthe mass transport occurs perpendicular to the bioﬁlm. The
choice of an implicit scheme guarantees fast convergent
solutions. The numerical solution was based on the ﬂow
chart reported in Fig. 2using an iterative process in which
the initial substrates trends were hypothesized both in thebioﬁlm and along the reactor. The iterative process was
interrupted when an error lower than 10
-6was achieved.
The ﬂux model
The ﬂux model, applied to the whole reactor, is based on
the following simplifying hypotheses (La Motta and
Mulcahy 1978 ; Eramo et al. 1994 ; Viotti et al. 2002 ):
1. The ﬂow in the reactor can be considered to be one-
dimensional;
2. The active processes in the reactor are the convective
and dispersive processes;
3. The substrates are considered to be dissolved and their
concentrations do not interfere with the ﬂuid motion;
4. The biomass is present only in the attached form;
therefore, the further removal effect caused from the
suspended biomass is not considered in the modelling(so remaining in safety conditions);
5. The characteristics of the material in the supports are
uniform in the reactor;
6. Conditions are steady state;
7. Head losses can be considered very low (negligible)
due to the low velocity of the ﬂuid (few cm s
-1). The
pressure drops are, however, controlled by the air ﬂux
in the airlift device that controls the ﬂow managing the
mass balance of the liquid phase.
Steady-state condition can be considered applicable if
different time scales are observed for the different involved
processes (Klapper and Dockery 2010 ); the biological
processes here observed operate at larger time scales as
compared to the time scales of the ﬂow. In fact, as reportedby Klapper and Dockery ( 2010 ), ‘‘the usual practice is to
introduce equilibrium in the fast processes: bulk ﬂuid ﬂow,
when considered, is assumed steady over a quasi-staticbioﬁlm, and then advection–reaction–diffusion processes

Author's personal copyare also assumed to be quasi-steady relative to the given
ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld.’’ The mass balance equation, which is
used to model the concentration variation of each substrate
in the reactor ( Sb), can be written by assuming the scheme
shown in Fig. 3, in which the zaxes is assumed to be
positive in the downward direction. Because there are
typically no radial gradients in the concentration, radialdispersion has no effect and can be neglected (Devinny and
Ramesh 2005 ).

Equation 2can be rewritten for each substrate involved in
the process (COD, NH 4?,N O 2-,NO 3-and oxygen). In the
present paper, however, the oxygen transport–dispersion
equation along the reactor was neglected and replaced by adistribution derived by means of Henry’s law. The
assumption was possible because of the high contributions
of air from the diffusers located along the reactor and fromthe air lift which allowed neglecting the oxygen limiting
conditions in the bulk ﬂuid. Furthermore, the nitrite equation
is not reported in both of the models (ﬂux model along thereactor—bioﬁlm model), to simplify the manuscript. The
substance is in fact considered as an intermediate product of
ammonia oxidation/nitrate reduction.
In the following paragraph, the equations are written for
a generic substrate S
b, while the speciﬁc equations are
reported in Table 1for each of the considered substrates
(COD, NH 4?,N O 3-). The complete set of parameters used
in the model equation is reported in Table 2. The Eq. 2was
adimentionalized by dividing the concentration by the inlet
concentration Sbiand by dividing zbyHr.

The bioﬁlm model
The utilization of a substrate by the microorganisms takes
place through three different mechanisms (Viotti et al.2002 ; Saravanan and Sreekrishnan 2008 ): (1) external mass
transport (substrate transport from the liquid phase to the
liquid-bioﬁlm interface); (2) internal mass transfer (sub-strate transport from the interface to the inner part of the
bioﬁlm) and (3) substrate utilization inside the bioﬁlm. The
removal process of each substrate can be analyzed bywriting the mass balance equation for the reference volume
with the following assumptions (La Motta and Mulcahy
1978 ; Eramo et al. 1994 ; Viotti et al. 2002 ):
1. The bioﬁlm is homogeneous and its thickness is
uniform;
2. In the mass balance equation the transport process is
given only by the diffusive process based on Fick’s
law, Dis the molecular diffusion coefﬁcient charac-
teristic of each substrate;
3. The removal kinetic reactions are based on a multi-
substrate Michaelis–Menten’s law; the assumption ofremoval kinetics of ﬁrst-order for the carbonaceous
substrate has been reported in the scientiﬁc literature
Fig. 3 Reactor ( a) and bioﬁlm
(b) reference systemsInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.
123
Author's personal copyand has been conﬁrmed by the experimental results
reported in Luciano et al. ( 2012 ). For the nitriﬁcation
process, a removal rate between the ﬁrst and the
second order has been observed. By considering a
multi-substrate limiting model, it is possible to takeinto consideration the non-linearity of the removal
kinetics. This is also favoured from the different time-
scales of the processes, so in the upper section of thereactor takes place mainly the removal of COD. The
nitriﬁcation process is delayed by the slower kinetic
and occurs at middle depths, where the DO is stillavailable. Nitrates here produced are then removed in
the deeper part of the bioﬁlm, where small amounts of
COD are still available and the DO penetration islimited both due to the high shear stresses at the
liquid–bioﬁlm interface and to its biological
consumption.
4. The conditions are steady-state;
5. The supports are cylindrical and the bioﬁlm growth
occurs on both the inner and outer surfaces.
With respect to the reference system chosen for the
particle (Fig. 3b), the mass balance equation for the generic
substrate ( S) applied on an inﬁnitesimal bioﬁlm thickness
dr, can be written in terms of steady state conditions:

Because the convective terms are negligible, the transport
in the bioﬁlm structure is represented only by means of the
diffusion term based on the Fick’s law.The S(r)distribution

ﬂux and the internal ﬂux. The external ﬂux is related to theconcentration gradient through the mass exchange

The denitriﬁcation process
In the three substrates models, the transport and degrada-
tion equation in the bioﬁlm is written for each substrate.The nitriﬁcation and the denitriﬁcation processes generally
occur under opposite conditions (aerobic and anoxic con-
ditions, respectively) (Hwang et al. 2005 ). In the waste-
water treatment systems that use an attached biomass, thetotal balance of the nitrogen in the liquid phase is often not
satisﬁed because anoxic conditions can occur in the deeper
areas of the bioﬁlm, allowing for the denitriﬁcation even ifdissolved oxygen is still present in the liquid phase
(Walters et al. 2009 ; Okabe et al. 1996 ; Satoh et al. 2004 ).
In addition, Pochana and Keller ( 1999 ) and Puznava et al.
(2001 ) show that the simultaneous nitriﬁcation and deni-
triﬁcation (SND) could occur as a consequence of the DOconcentration gradients within microbial ﬂocs or bioﬁlms.
Nitriﬁers will develop on the surface of the bioﬁlm where
there are rather high DO levels, whereas denitriﬁers will bepresent inside the bioﬁlm due to the low levels or absence
of oxygen. As a result, the effectiveness of SND is
dependent on the size, density and distribution of the bio-ﬁlm thickness (Pochana and Keller 1999 ). Studies carried
out using microelectrodes show that in the case of ﬂocs,
when the diameters approach approximately1,000–3,000 lm, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation will take
place in different zones of the ﬂoc (Walters et al. 2009 ,
Satoh et al. 2003 ; Hille et al. 2009 ). Several studies have
evaluated the possible performance of other treatment
systems of attached biomass (Rahimia et al. 2011 ). For the
growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the bioﬁlm, two sub-strates are required, i.e., an electron acceptor (dissolved
oxygen DO) and an electron donor (soluble organic mat-
ter). Both substrates are essential for bacterial growth(Wang and Wang 2012 ) and, consequently, the whole
process is inhibited when one of the two is not available
(Rauch et al. 1999 ). Furthermore, nitriﬁcation is adversely
affected at high COD:N ratios due to the direct competition
for molecular oxygen between autotrophs (nitrifying
microorganisms) and heterotrophs (carbonaceous substratebased microorganisms). If the COD:N ratio signiﬁcantly
decreases, denitriﬁcation can be inhibited due to the deﬁ-
ciency of an electron donor source (Walters et al. 2009 ). In
developing the proposed model, the penetration depth of
the oxygen in the bioﬁlm was considered by taking into
consideration the amount of oxygen consumed by theremoval of carbonaceous substrates and by the nitriﬁcation
process along the bioﬁlm thickness. The whole process also
considers the resistances to transport from the externalsurface of the bioﬁlm to the active sites (internal transport).
By evaluating the oxygen and carbonaceous substrate
depth penetration, the numerical model allows for theevaluation of the nitrates removal along the thickness of the
attached biomass system. Although the equation used is
identical for all of the substrates, in the case of nitrate, twoadditional limiting factors were taken into consideration:
the ﬁrst related to the concentration of the oxygen and theInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.
123
Author's personal copysecond to the concentration of COD. The biological
removal factor was then multiplied by two parameters, a
andb, which are deﬁned below (see Table 3).
Both of these two factors vary with the depth, and with
the bioﬁlm thickness. The assumed hypothesis is to
describe the variations of the two parameters through a
simple step function:
a¼1i f O2/C201m gl/C01
a¼0i f O2[1m gl/C01/C26
ð30Þ
b¼0 if COD \0;1m gl/C01
b¼1 if COD /C210;1m gl/C01/C26
ð31Þ
In this way, nitrate removal can occur in the bioﬁlm
layer under anoxic condition and at the same time, when
the layer contains enough COD. The modiﬁed massbalance then assumes the form of equation A6 (Table 3).
Concurrently, the complete equation, used to evaluate the
total amount of consumed oxygen, is correlated to theamount of substrate consumption through the following

Substrate utilization rate
The numerical integration of Eq. 27over the bioﬁlm
thickness, for the three substrates, provides the concentra-
tion trends of COD, NH 4and NO 3inside the bioﬁlm. By
knowing the concentration proﬁles, it is possible to obtain
the average rate of substrate utilization per unit volume of
the bioﬁlm, Rothat represents the observed reaction rate:

Results and discussion
Sensitivity tests analysisIn the following paragraphs are reported the sensitivity
tests where are used typical inlet values of a wastewater of
5,000 inhabitants (COD =252 mgL
-1,N H 4?=TN=
33 mgL-1,N O 3-=0 mgL-1,D O B1 mgL-1,Q =
14 Ls-1, length of tubular support =15 m, nt =20,
internal reactor diameter =0.86 m, total reactor length =
30 m).
Sensitivity tests were carried out to determine the
inﬂuence of each parameter on the process. The sensitivity
analysis was carried out by considering the typicaldimensions of a plant at full scale ( H
r,D). Table 4reports
the results for the different parameters studied in the sen-
sitivity analysis.
The results show that the diffusivity essentially does not
inﬂuence the overall removal rate. The same conclusion
can be drawn for the amounts of insufﬂate air (air lift andair for the biological reactions).
Figure 4reports the numerical results of some of the
simulations carried out in the sensitivity analysis withdifferent bioﬁlm thicknesses (being constant the thickness
along all the tubular supports). Graphs of the substrates
trend inside the bioﬁlm thickness at different reactor depthsare presented to evidence the effects of bioﬁlm stratiﬁca-
tion, due to the contemporary partial penetration of the
substrates (COD, DO, NH
4?), and the fate of the secondary
substrates (NO 3-in this case). The graphs are the results of
the combined action of the processes (carbonaceous sub-
strate oxidation, nitriﬁcation, denitriﬁcation and DO con-sumption) obtained from the numerical model.
Reference conditionsThe considered reference conditions (ﬂow rate, inlet con-
centrations and dimensions) were chosen to represent aplant at full-scale designed for 5,000 inhabitants (Table 5).
Some of the operating parameters (bioﬁlm thickness, COD,
NH
4?utilization rate) were derived from experiments
(Luciano et al. 2012 ). Other values are obtained from the
results of several authors (Horn and Morgenroth 2006 ;
Beccari et al. 1993 , Characklis and Marshall 1989 ; Metcalf
and Eddy 2003 ). The results of the simulation using the
reference conditions are shown in Fig. 4(r=1,000 lm).
The ﬁgure shows the substrates proﬁles resulting from theintegration of the set of equations (COD, NH
4,N O 3,N O 2)
along the reactor (Fig. 4e–g) and along the bioﬁlmthickness (Fig. 4a–d) for three different reactor depths (5,
10, 15 m) and for the different substrates. The sensitivity
tests have been performed considering the absence of
nitrates at the inlet; the nitrates are only generated from thenitriﬁcation process along the reactor while the mass bal-
ance carried out on the total nitrogen (TN) shows the effect
of the denitriﬁcation that occurs in the layered bioﬁlm. TheCOD removal percentage is high and equal to 94.4 %
(252 mgL
-1inlet–14.2 mgL-1outlet), ammonia was par-
tially removed (56.7 %, 33 mgL-1inlet–14.29 mgL-1
outlet), while the nitrates removal percentage is limited and
equal to 26.7 % (33 mgL-1inlet–24.7 mgL-1outlet).
Along the reactor (Fig. 4g), it is possible to observe the
modelled nitrates production deriving from the nitriﬁcation
process. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen in thebulk liquid is calculated by using Henry’s law. The oxygen
consumption is related to the substrate’s degradation. From
the results, it is observed that the oxygen penetration intothe bioﬁlm ( r=1,000 lm) in the ﬁrst part of the reactor
(5 m depth) is 200 lm (Fig. 4d, 5 m); the remaining part of
the bioﬁlm can then be considered to be under anoxicconditions. In the ﬁrst meters of the reactor, the oxygen
consumption is higher due to the high concentrations of the
substrates (COD and NH
4). However, at depths of 10 m
(penetration depth of 400 lm, Fig. 4d, 10 m) and 15 m
(penetration depth of 800 lm, Fig. 4d, 15 m), the oxygen
consumption is limited because the carbonaceous andnitrogen substrates are diminished. When the COD con-
centration in the deeper part of the reactor can be consid-
ered null (Fig. 4a, 15 m), and the oxygen penetration in the
bioﬁlm is high (Fig. 4d, 15 m), the denitriﬁcation process
does not occur (Fig. 4c, 15 m); therefore, the nitrates
transformation takes place mainly in the higher region ofthe reactor (Fig. 4c, 5 and 10 m).
Bioﬁlm thickness variationThree different values of bioﬁlm thickness were analyzed:
–r=100lm
–r=500lm
–r=1 mm (reference condition)
Forr=500lm and r=1 mm, the penetration of the
COD substrate into the bioﬁlm in the upper region of thereactor is equivalent (500 and 510 lm, Fig. 4a) to a similar
removal efﬁciency even if there is a signiﬁcant difference in
the thickness (Fig. 4e). This behaviour is due to the depen-
dence of the rate of substrate utilization per unit volume of
the reactor with the efﬁciency factor, which diminishes with
the thickness of the bioﬁlm because of an increase in thediffusional resistance. However, the efﬁciency factor also
depends on the bioﬁlm volume, which increases with the
thickness. Therefore, two mechanisms that can beInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol.

Author's personal copyconsidered to oppose one another act on the removal rate: the
efﬁciency factor and the bioﬁlm volume. When considering
the ratio between the substrate utilization rates, when the
bioﬁlm thickness is 500 lm and 1 mm, respectively, the
efﬁciency factor is halved, but the bioﬁlm volume doubles,
so the degree of removal is practically the same (Fig. 4e).
When the thickness is larger than 1 mm, the efﬁciency factordecreases due to the high thickness of the bioﬁlm, but the
volume increases so much that the net result is a higher
removal. When the thickness of the bioﬁlm is small, the
bioﬁlm is completely penetrated and the whole ﬁlm depth
participates to the removal process. Due to the small volumeinvolved on the support, however, the overall efﬁciency is
lower. For the dissolved oxygen trend with a larger bioﬁlm
thickness, the presence of anoxic zones in the bioﬁlm can beobserved until a depth of 10 m (Fig. 4d, 5 and 15 m, thick-
ness of 500 lm and 1 mm), whereas for a smaller bioﬁlm
thickness (100 lm), the oxygen can completely penetrate the
bioﬁlm depth, preventing the formation of anoxic layers
along the whole reactor length and therefore practically
inhibiting the nitrates removal process. As mentioned above,the COD proﬁle along the reactors for bioﬁlm thicknesses of
500lm and 1,000 lm are practically identical due to the
overall behaviour related to the bioﬁlm penetration. Moresigniﬁcant differences can be observed in the case of NH
4,
where, due to the slower rate of the nitrifying bacteria, the
bioﬁlm thickness plays an important role. In the case of thegreater bioﬁlm thicknesses, in the inner bioﬁlm where COD
is not penetrated the nitriﬁcation process mainly occurs, as it
can also be observed from the higher value of nitrates gen-erated from the process (Fig. 4g). The balance of the TN
evidences the effect of the denitriﬁcation process, which is
limited to the higher bioﬁlm thicknesses and shallowerdepths in the reactor.
COD inlet variationThe tests on the variation of the COD inlet concentration
were carried out to verify the inﬂuence of this parameter onthe nitric nitrogen removal because, together with theanoxic condition, it is one of the limiting factors of the
denitriﬁcation phase. In this case, the values assigned to the
different tests were:
– COD
bi=252 mgL-1(reference condition)
– COD bi=600 mgL-1
– COD bi=100 mgL-1
It is well known that the COD plays an important role in
the denitriﬁcation process. With an inlet concentrationequal to 100 mgL
-1at a reactor depth of 5 m, the COD
concentration is equal to 15 mgL-1, and due to the pres-
ence of the dissolved oxygen at this depth there are noanoxic zones. Thus, the denitriﬁcation is limited to the ﬁrst
4.5 m of the reactor. If, however, the COD concentration at
the inlet is equal to 600 mgL
-1, at a depth of 5 m, the
thickness of the anoxic zone is greater than that under the
reference condition because the oxygen consumption is
larger. In combination with high volumetric loading rates,high C:N ratios lead to a noticeable decrease in the nitri-
ﬁcation rate. Therefore, the competition for the available
oxygen shifts the balance within the bioﬁlm, favouring thedenitrifying bacteria (Walter et al. 2005 ); this result should
be considered also when evaluating the recirculation ratio.
Nitrogen inlet variation
The tests were carried out with the following boundary
conditions:
–N H
4i=33 mgL-1(reference condition)
–N H 4i=60 mgL-1
–N H 4i=15 mgL-1
By varying the inlet concentration, it is possible to
observe a small variation in the removal efﬁciency. This
effect can be attributed to two superimposed phenomena:the ﬂow velocity (which deﬁnes the HRT); and the ratio
between the autotrophic and heterotrophic biomasses.
From the results, as evidenced in the next section, it can
be deduced that the ﬂow velocity is the most inﬂuent
parameter on the performances of the process.Table 3 Complete set of dimensionless transport equations along the bioﬁlm thickness

Author's personal copyFlow variation
Two further values of the ﬂow rate were evaluated to
determine how the model would respond to the variation in
such an important parameter. The ﬂow velocity surelyinﬂuences the HRT and the diffusional resistances at the
bioﬁlm–bulk liquid interface (Vieira and Melo 1999 ).
Generally, a high turbulence (high Reynolds number)favours the mass transfer at the interface between the
bioﬁlm and bulk liquid, thereby allowing for a better
penetration of the substrates, but at the same time the HRTdiminishes (obviously neglecting a possible recycle), and
this cause the reduction in the overall degree of removal.
Model validation
The proposed model was validated by means of several
simulations based on the experimental results derived from
the lab-scale reactor described in ‘‘Experimental set-up for
model validation’’. A detailed description of the experi-mental results is reported in Luciano et al. 2012 . The
parameters used for the simulations are the same as those
reported in Table 5, except for the reactor dimensions and
bioﬁlm thickness. Figure 5shows the comparisons of three
different experimental runs, for which different bioﬁlmthickness were considered. Samples during the experiments
were collected in time in a re-circulating reactor (corre-
sponding to a reactor with a length of 5 m). Due to thesteady state conditions of the tests, the samples can be
considered distributed over the space (reactor length). In
Fig. 5, space was added as a secondary abscissa (using the
ﬂux velocity, 0.00034 ms
-1,in the experiments as the
conversion factor) to avoid any doubt. The model correctly
predicts the experimental data, which showed an increasein the COD removal with an increase in bioﬁlm thickness(Fig. 5a, c). Thicker bioﬁlms (Fig. 5c, d) showed increases
in removal efﬁciencies for both of the substrates, even if
higher volumes of attached biomass reveal the effectscaused by the diffusional resistance inside the bioﬁlm that
limited the COD and oxygen penetration. The results in
terms of COD and NH
4?trends in the reactor demonstrate
the capability of the model to reproduce the experimental
behaviour of the reactor in all the three tests with different
bioﬁlms thicknesses.
Conclusion
The numerical model presented in this work is able to properly
simulate the removal of the different substrates in a new andalternative wastewater treatment system with high efﬁcien-
cies, low volumes requirement and low odour impact. The
model can be considered an intermediate level between moresophisticated models (in terms of biomasses description) and
simpler models, and can therefore represents a valid tool for
plant design and optimal management strategy. In the case of aweak organic load in the wastewater, an exhaustive (in-depth)
study on the biomasses does not really enhance the results with
particular regard to the efﬁciencies values that represent, froma design perspective, the most important parameter for the
optimal sizing of the treatment sections. The model demon-
strates the inﬂuence of the hydrodynamic and biologicalprocesses on the substrate removal efﬁciency. The results
indicate that the most important parameter in order to obtain
an excellent treatment is the bioﬁlm thickness. A thickerbioﬁlm does not offer great advantages in terms of carbona-
ceous substrate removal, but it may play an important role in
nitrogen treatment. A large bioﬁlm thickness can allow for
nitriﬁcation as well as denitriﬁcation in the deeper part of the
bioﬁlm layers; the simultaneous nitriﬁcation/denitriﬁcationTable 4 Sensitivity analysis results (* Reference conditions)

Author's personal copyprocesses can also be regulated from the amount of available
carbonaceous substrates and from the oxygen penetration intothe bioﬁlm. The diffusional resistances at the bioﬁlm/bulk
liquid interface are important; an increment of the ﬂow
velocity, improves the mass transfer between the bulk liquidand the internal bioﬁlm because of the increase of turbulencebut, at the same time, can induce a drastic reduction in the
overall removal efﬁciency due to the reduction in thehydraulic residence time. It should be noted as the presented
model was used for the design of treatment plant at a full-scale
in deep shaft reactor currently operating in Italy (Abbadia SanSalvatore, SI).Table 5 Reference parameters used in the simulation
