A major issue in all data collection for molecular phylogenetics is
taxon sampling, which refers to the use of data from only a smallrepresentative set of species for inferring higher-level evolutionaryhistory. Insufﬁcient taxon sampling is often cited as a signiﬁcantsource of error in phylogenetic studies, and consequently, acqui-sition of large data sets is advocated. To test this assertion, we haveconducted computer simulation studies by using natural collec-tions of evolutionary parameters—rates of evolution, species sam-pling, and gene lengths—determined from data available ingenomic databases. A comparison of the true tree with treesconstructed by using taxa subsamples and trees constructed byusing all taxa shows that the amount of phylogenetic error perinternal branch is similar; a result that holds true for the neighbor-joining, minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, and maximumlikelihood methods. Furthermore, our results show that eventhough trees inferred by using progressively larger taxa sub-samples of a real data set become increasingly similar to treesinferred by using the full sample, all inferred trees are equidistantfrom the true tree in terms of phylogenetic error per internalbranch. Our results suggest that longer sequences, rather thanextensive sampling, will better improve the accuracy of phyloge-netic inference.
Taxon sampling refers to the process of selecting representa-
tive taxa for a phylogenetic analysis. Nonexhaustive taxon
sampling occurs for a number of reasons. Data may not be
available from every extant species because of constraints oftime, money, or rarity. In most cases, the number of potentialspecies increases quickly if one is interested in phylogeneticrelationships above the level of genus or family. Therefore, it isimpractical, if not impossible, to sample every species fromclades of interest. Rather, representative species from each cladeare chosen and the reconstructed phylogenetic relationships ofthese species are taken to represent the evolutionary history oftheir respective clades.
Insufficient taxon sampling is often cited as a major source of
error in phylogenetic analysis (e.g., refs. 1–10). However, asexpected, the value of increasing the number of sequences(species) in a data set depends on the scope of sampling (11–14).Sampling within a fully framed monophyletic group may improvephylogenetic accuracy, but sampling outside of the group pushesthe most recent common ancestor of the new set of taxa back intime and may decrease accuracy (13). Random sampling ofadditional taxa is thought to decrease, rather than increase,phylogenetic accuracy (12–14).
One reason why increased taxon sampling is thought to
improve phylogenetic resolution is that it may counteract the‘‘long branch attraction’’ problem, where long, unrelatedbranches may group together erroneously (15, 16). Increasedtaxon sampling may break long branches and help reduce theaverage branch length throughout the tree (13, 17–19). However,computer simulation results have been equivocal about thebenefit of increased taxon sampling for reducing the long branchproblem (11, 12, 19–21). The importance of extensive taxonsampling is already well established for estimating evolutionaryparameters (4, 22, 23) and in independent contrasts (24).There have also been a number of empirical studies on the
value of taxon sampling on phylogenetic inference (2–10). Thesestudies typically begin with a large number of species and thenexamine the results of analyzing subsamples; most have con-cluded that phylogenetic trees reconstructed with more taxa aremore accurate than those inferred from fewer taxa. Theseconclusions assume that the phylogeny inferred by using thelargest data set available is closest to the true tree; an assumptionthat is not well established, because the ‘‘true tree’’ is not knownin empirical studies. At present these studies appear to havesimply demonstrated that topologies reconstructed by usinglarger subsamples show higher congruence with the full tree.Therefore, this problem is most readily studied by computersimulation because the ‘‘true tree’’ is known. However, previoussimulation and theoretical studies (11, 19–21) were often notconducted by subsampling from a large tree, as mentionedabove, but rather began with a small number of species andprogressively added additional species to long branches in thestarting cluster, keeping the subsample tree fixed.
We conducted a simulation study motivated by issues an
evolutionary biologist would encounter with real data. We beganwith a large predetermined phylogeny (as is the case with allempirical studies, the true tree of life having been fixed viaevolution) and generated data sets consisting of sampled taxafrom the ‘‘known’’ full phylogeny. In our simulations, we exam-ined the problem of taxon sampling by using evolutionary rates,species representations, and gene length parameters for DNAand amino acid sequences derived from molecular sequencedatabases. In addition, we used model trees based on actual treespublished in the literature, rather than an artificial tree createdfrom a theoretical branching process or an artificial clustering
scheme, in order to make our simulations an accurate represen-tation of the topologies and distributions of branch lengths foundin real data.
Materials and Methods
We used two different simulation schemes. For the first case, we
chose the 66-taxa tree representing the phylogenetic relation-ships among Eutherian mammals from Murphy et al. (ref. 1; Fig.
1). The branch lengths represent the number of substitutions persite. This tree was chosen because it revises many well estab-lished beliefs about mammalian evolution (see also ref. 25). Forinstance, lagomorphs had previously been found to be distantlyrelated to sciurognath rodents in analyses of large numbers ofgenes for a few taxa (e.g., ref. 26), and rodents were thought tobe an outgroup to artiodactyls and primates (27). Murphy et al.

EVOLUTIONexclusion of artiodactyls. Therefore, we derived the topology of
the tree in Fig. 1 by using their mammalian phylogeny. Note thatMurphy et al. ’s tree is based on a larger taxonomic sample than
other studies, but has a fraction of the genes when compared withother studies that have smaller numbers of representative taxa(26, 27).
We simulated DNA evolution for 50 hypothetical genes for
Fig. 1, each with independent evolutionary properties, using theJukes–Cantor (28) model of nucleotide substitution [we alsoconducted analyses under the Hasegawa–Kishino–Yano model(29) and obtained similar results (data not shown)]. The se-quence length and substitution rate were determined randomlyfor each gene. The sequence length was picked from a uniform
distribution ranging from 500 to 3,000 (the range of sequencelengths commonly found in the literature). Because the branchlengths of the model tree (Fig. 1) already represent substitutionsper site, the substitution rate for each gene represented a randommultiplier of these branch lengths, picked from a gamma distri-bution with a gamma parameter of 1 (as observed from a dataset of homologous human and mouse genes at only first andsecond codon positions). After simulating evolution across thefull tree, a random subsample of taxa was chosen. The size of thesubsample was randomly selected from a uniform distribution of5 to 50, and the specific sampled taxa were selected randomlyfrom the full complement of 66 taxa.The model tree for the second set of simulations was based on
an 18-taxa phylogeny of vertebrates (refs. 30–32; Fig. 2). These18 taxa represent the most commonly found taxa in the geneticdatabases. There were 1,167 genes in our orthology databasederived from
HOVERGEN (33) with sequences for at least four of
the taxa. The observed amino acid substitution rate and se-quence length (100 to 2,696 sites) for each gene was used as thebasis for simulating amino acid sequences on the tree by using thePoisson substitution model. Empirical substitution rates wereestimated by using least-squares regression through the origin ofpairwise sequence divergences and divergence times (34) forspecies in Fig. 2. Taxon sampling for each gene was determinedby the availability of taxa for that gene in GenBank. Because
some species are much more common in the database thanothers, this sampling is biased toward certain taxa and allows usto explore the effect of biased sampling as would be experiencedby practicing biologists today. There were 100 simulation repli-cates for each gene for both the DNA and amino acid simula-tions. All simulations were conducted by using programs writtenby the authors.
All analyses were performed by using

JC model. In ME, MP, and ML a single heuristic search wasperformed with Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange branch swap-ping. For ME and ML, the NJ tree was used as the starting treefor the heuristic search; for MP, a stepwise addition procedurewas used. A more exhaustive, time consuming search is notnecessary because it is clear that it does not improve phyloge-netic accuracy (36–39). The maximum number of trees thatcould be saved during the heuristic search procedures was set to10,000 (most of the searches never came close to reaching thislimit). When multiple trees were found under the ME, MP, andML procedures, a majority rule consensus tree (retaining allcompatible clades even under 50% frequency of occurrence withthe LE50 option in
PAUP* ) was used to create a single resultant
tree for each analysis. The resultant tree was then compared withthe true (model) tree and the topological distance, d
T(40, 41),
was recorded. This distance is twice the number of interiorbranches at which the two trees being compared differ. Forsubsample analyses, the topological distance between the truetree and the inferred subsample tree was computed by using thepruned true tree that contained only the subsampled taxa. Tree
distance is not directly comparable among trees with differentnumbers of taxa, because d
Tdirectly depends on the number of
taxa (two unrooted trees of four taxa trees have a maximum dT
of 2, whereas two 66-taxa trees have a maximum dTof 126).Therefore, we normalize the dTvalue and define the phyloge-
netic error per internal branch, E5dTy2(n23), where nis the
number of taxa, and n23 is the number of internal branches in
a bifurcating tree. Eranges from 0 to 1, indicating that the
proportion of internal branches inferred incorrectly. Other
scaling metrics (e.g., scaling by the number of taxa) led to similarconclusions.
Phylogeny reconstruction was performed under a number of
scenarios for each simulation. First, all of the sequences for allgenes were concatenated into a single data set; the error betweenthese inferred trees and the true tree is designated E
concat .
Second, each gene was analyzed individually (gene-by-geneanalysis) with all taxa included. In this case, we computephylogenetic error ( E
G) by directly comparing the true tree with
the inferred full tree for the given gene. Third, each gene wasanalyzed individually with only the subsampled taxa for that geneincluded. In this case, the phylogenetic error ( E
S) was computed
by comparing the inferred subsample tree and true tree prunedto contain only the taxa in the subsample (Fig. 3).
Results and Discussion
DNA Sequence Evolution. In the DNA simulations, the 50 simu-
lated genes consisted of a total of 79,410 sites (an average of1,588 sites per gene). The average number of taxa subsampledwas 28. The results for ME, NJ, MP, and ML were quite similar.

EVOLUTIONTable 1 lists the number of sampled taxa, number of sites,
substitution rate, and results of the ME analysis for each gene;the overall results for all methods are summarized in Table 2. Inthis set of analyses it is clear that the ML method reconstructsthe trees most accurately, followed by MP, then NJ and ME.
For the concatenated data set, the mean phylogenetic error
(E
concat ) was 2–3%, with the true tree inferred in about 17% of
the replicates. In any case, the inferred tree contained only oneor two incorrect partitions. For individual genes, the error ( E
G)
varied tremendously by gene, from 0.04 to 0.72 with a mean of0.17 for the ME method. In general the true tree was neverrecovered by using individual genes. The variation among genesis due to a combination of both mutation rate and number ofsites. Although both were important factors, the number of sitesseems to have been more critical. For ME, the correlationbetween number of sites and E
Gwas 20.552, whereas the
correlation of substitution rate and EGwas20.326. As would be
expected, there is no correlation ( r50.023) between number of
sites and substitution rate. For trees inferred with a subsampleof taxa, the mean error ( E
S) was 0.19. This value is very similar
to that obtained from trees inferred by using the full set of taxa(cf.E
G50.17, Table 1). The correlation between the number of
taxa and ES(r52 0.055) was 10-fold lower than the correlation
with sequence length.
To construct a direct comparison between the phylogenetic
relationships of the subsampled taxa as obtained by using all taxaand only the subsample taxa, we pruned the inferred treesobtained by using all of the taxa to contain just the subsampledtaxa and determined the phylogenetic error between this prunedinferred tree and the true tree ( E
P). The mean phylogenetic error
for ME was 0.16, which is again quite similar to EGandES(Table2). On average, more than doubling the number of taxa increased
the percent of correct branches by only 2–3% (with an averagesubsample of 28, this increase represents less than a single
branch). Note that even though E
Sis greater than EGandEPfor
very small subsamples ( ,10 taxa), the difference in phylogenetic
error is usually much smaller than one branch per tree. There-fore, use of only a fraction of taxa provides practically indistin-guishable results. The similarities among E
G,ES, and EPpersist

Amino Acid Sequence Evolution. In the amino acid simulations, the
1,167 simulated genes consisted of a total of 464,990 sites (anaverage of 398.5 sites per gene). The average number of taxasubsampled was 4.7, following the presence of species availablefor different genes in GenBank. ME, MP, and NJ gave similarresults, which are summarized in Table 3. In these analyses, MPwas the most accurate, followed by NJ and ME.
For the concatenated data set, we were always able to recover
the correct tree with all of the data. For ME, the mean error forindividual genes ( E
G) ranged from 0.02 to 0.84, with a mean of
0.18. Again, the number of sites seems to have been more criticalthan the substitution rate. The correlation between number ofsites and E
Gwas20.459, whereas the correlation of substitution
rate and EGwas20.356.
The mean ESwas 0.10, which is lower than the 0.18 for the full
complement of taxa ( EG). At first glance, it seems to imply that
the subsample trees (those containing fewer taxa) were more
accurate than the trees containing all of the taxa! Clearly, thisobservation is unexpected and contrary to the often assumedbenefit of increased taxon sampling. As was done for DNAsimulations, we test the validity of this result by comparing theamount of phylogenetic error in inferring phylogenetic relation-ships of the subsampled taxa as obtained by using all taxa andonly the subsample taxa ( E
P, Fig. 3). EPwas almost identical to
ES. The differences of ESand EGare explained by the fact that
most of the errors in the trees inferred by using all taxa werethose in the most basal three or four taxa (Fig. 2), which werealmost always absent from the taxon-sampled trees (because ofthe nature of the current gene sequence databases). Therefore,the similarity of the E
Sand EPvalues make it clear that the
subsample and full taxon set analyses were able to reconstructtrees with equivalent accuracy even though the average numberof taxa in the subsample was less than five.
Taxon Sampling Versus Phylogenetic Signal. In general, the above
results indicate that incomplete taxon sampling has a muchsmaller effect on the accuracy of a phylogeny as compared withthe number of sites and substitution rates. It is therefore
unwarranted to simply dismiss undesired or unexpected phylo-genetic relationships obtained by using small numbers of taxa asthe result of poor taxon sampling. Poor character sampling withweak phylogenetic signal is more likely to be the cause. In ourstudy, taxon sampling had similar effects on phylogeny recon-struction for all of the major reconstruction methods. When thesignal was strong, all of the methods reproduced the correct tree;when the signal was weak, none of them did. The one majordifference among the different reconstruction methods in thisstudy is their relationship with substitution rate and sequence
length. All methods showed a stronger correlation betweenreconstruction accuracy and the number of sites than betweenaccuracy and the substitution rate (see also ref. 37). This effectwas strongest in MP, which consistently showed both a highereffect of number of sites and a lower effect of rate than any othermethod (Tables 2 and 3).
Empirical Versus Simulation Studies. Our simulation results appear
to conflict with empirical studies that have reported improvedperformance with increased taxon sampling. We examined thesepatterns empirically with the raw data from the study thatproduced the Eutherian mammal tree (1). For each of the 17genes (Table 4), we inferred the phylogeny for all taxa by usingNJ. We then created 500 random subsamples consisting of 15, 30,and 45 taxa each. Each subsample was constrained to contain atleast one species from each of 13 mammalian orders present inthe tree (assuming data were available for the order). Thesesubsamples were analyzed with NJ, and the phylogenetic differ-ence per internal branch was determined between the results ofthe subsampled taxa and the pruned results from the full taxa(D
E, Fig. 3).
DEdeclines as the sample size increases (Table 4). However,
this does not indicate that trees with larger numbers of taxa aremore accurate with respect to the true tree than those with fewertaxa, because this comparison does not involve the true tree (Fig.3). The results in Table 4 merely show that trees based on similarnumbers of taxa (e.g., 66 and 45) tend to be more similar thanthose based on dissimilar numbers of taxa (e.g., 66 and 15).

EVOLUTIONpreviously calculated the error between the true tree and the
reconstructed trees ( ESand EP). These errors were found to be
largely independent of the size of the taxon sample. When wecalculate D
Efor our simulations, we find a negative correlation
between it and subsample size (Table 5)—i.e., as the subsamplesize gets larger, the topological differences among the full andsubsample inferred trees gets smaller. This is the identicalpattern found for the empirical results in Table 4. In addition, D
E
is only slightly smaller than ESandEP(Table 5). Therefore, there
is as much topological difference between full and subsampletrees as is observed between these trees and the true tree. Thisindicates that the similarity of E
Sand Ep, regardless of the
number of taxa, is not due to identical phylogenetic inference.The use of different sample sizes (number of taxa) may lead to
different phylogenetic inferences; however, the error associatedwith these estimates is largely independent of the sample size.
This result has interesting implications for the difference in
phylogenetic position of rabbits, rodents, and primates in theEutherian phylogeny as obtained in studies based on smallnumbers of taxa and large numbers of genes versus those withmore extensive taxon sampling but much fewer genes (1, 25, 26,34, 42). If the model tree in Fig. 2 is indeed true, then our studyindicates that taxon sampling does not explain the discrepancy.Otherwise, the correct phylogenetic relationships of these threegroups are yet to be determined.

(25) is likely to resolve this issue. In general, our results do notprovide evidence in favor of adding taxa to problematic phylog-enies; instead, using more genes with longer sequences would bea better use of time and resources.
