Summary
Bioreductive anticancer agents possess two potential targets for selectivity, 
hyperexpressed activating enzymes and hypoxia. The subject of this thesis is part of an 
‘enzyme directed approach’  to rational drug development in which compounds are 
tailored to suit the catalytic preferences of key bioreductive enzymes. Studies have 
focused on the two-electron reducing flavoenzyme DT-diaphorase due to its increased 
expression and activity in tumour versus normal tissue and its ability to catalyse 
metabolism of substrates with structural similarity to principal bioreductive agents. The 
overall aim of the thesis was to determine the involvement of DT-diaphorase in the 
activation of the novel indoloquinone E09, aziridinylbenzoquinone AZQ and selected 
cyclopropamitosenes. Structure-activity relationships were examined using analogues 
of these compounds.
Initial experiments to characterise metabolism of E09 showed it to be efficiently 
reduced by DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of human HT29 and rat Walker cells as 
well as by a highly purified form of the rat enzyme. Chemosensitivity assays also 
demonstrated E09 to be a highly potent cytotoxin for these cell lines, which express 
high levels of DT-diaphorase. Study of E09 analogues showed that structural 
modification altered both ability to undergo metabolism catalysed by DT-diaphorase and 
cytotoxicity. A clear correlation was observed between cytotoxicity and metabolism 
with analogues which were better substrates for DT-diaphorase being more potent 
cytotoxins than the more poorly reduced derivatives. This supported the importance of 
DT-diaphorase in activation of the indoloquinones to their cytotoxic species. Inhibitor 
studies further substantiated this hypothesis but indicated involvement of additional 
enzymes. The latter possibility was supported by results of electron spin resonance 
spectroscopy experiments where NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase was shown to 
metabolise E09. The mechanism of reaction has to some extent been elucidated. Both 
DT-diaphorase and NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase metabolised E09 to highly 
oxygen sensitive metabolites which, in the presence of air, were auto-oxidised to 
generate highly reactive and potentially damaging oxygen and drug based radicals.
In intact cells E09 induced DNA damage in the form of strand breaks and interstrand 
cross-links at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This damage was more 
extensive in the high DT-diaphorase expressing cell line HT29 than in the BE cell line 
which does not express a functional form of the enzyme. Using a cell free system the
importance of DT-diaphorase activation for generation of both strand breaking and 
interstrand cross-linking species was determined. Monoadducts could be formed with 
DNA in the absence of activation although the sequence selectivity exhibited by the 
compound was found to be altered following reduction.
Neither hypoxia or pH altered the initial rate of E09 reduction catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase. Hypoxia did however alter the extent of DNA damage and other 
investigators have shown that both pH and hypoxia can influence cytotoxicity of this 
compound. Metabolism studies suggested that these parameters will influence the 
stability of metabolites formed.
AZQ and some cyclopropamitosenes were also reduced by purified rat Walker DT- 
diaphorase but less efficiently than E09. In a similar manner to E09 some correlation 
between metabolism and cytotoxicity was observed with the aziridinylbenzoquinones 
although the differences were within a far narrower range than for the indoloquinones.
To conclude, data presented in this thesis has confirmed a role for DT-diaphorase in 
activation of E09, AZQ and cyclopropamitosenes. In addition NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase has also been shown to metabolise E09. The mechanism of reaction 
and cytotoxicity has been partially elucidated and structure-activity relationship studies 
have highlighted features of the drug molecules which are important for both 
metabolism and cytotoxicity. Such information may be important in the design of 
improved analogues and for optimisation of clinical protocols employing these novel, 
bioreductive agents.

Declaration
I declare that the work presented in this thesis was solely carried out by myself except 
where outlined below:-
Some of the initial experiments included in Chapter 6 determining the metabolism of 
the aziridinylbenzoquinones were carried out by Nigel Suggett, a summer student in 
our laboratory, under my supervision. I did however confirm a large proportion of the 
results in subsequent repeat experiments.
The cross-linking and sequence selectivity assays described in Chapter 5 were 
performed by myself in Dr John Hartleys laboratory at University College and 
Middlesex School of Medicine (UCMS), London, UK. Due to lack of time, as this 
work was carried out at the end of my PhD, repeat experiments were performed using 
the same conditions by Mike Wyatt (UCMS). An autoradiogram from one of these 
repeat experiments was used in Figure 5.13 as it provided the clearest representation 
of the work obtained.

General Introduction
This thesis examines the activation of bioreductive anticancer agents by DT- 
diaphorase as part of an ‘enzyme directed’  approach to drug development. The 
introduction which follows presents the background to this subject area, beginning 
with an outline of the requirement for innovative, rational drug development. 
Hypoxia is presented as a problem for conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
and strategies of circumventing or exploiting hypoxia are discussed. In particular 
bioreductive anticancer agents and the enzymes involved in their activation are 
described in detail.
1.1 Cancer Therapy and Drug Development
The term cancer refers to a multitude of diseases which share the common 
characteristic of disordered growth. In Britain it is estimated that 1  in 3 people will 
develop cancer and 1  in 4 will die as a result of the disease. Current therapy of cancer 
includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgery is highly effective in 
localised non-metastatic tumours as well as non-malignant forms of the disease. 
Radiotherapy is also beneficial for localised treatment in many types of cancer but its 
use is limited by resistance and damage to normal tissues. Since most patients die as 
a result of metastatic spread, systemic treatment is essential for the majority of 
patients. Over the last 50 years several chemotherapeutic agents have been used 
clinically. Although significant advances have been made towards cure of particular 
types of cancer such as childhood leukaemia and testicular cancer there has been 
relatively little success against the major solid tumours and cancer remains the second 
biggest killer in the UK after coronary heart disease. The problem with established 
chemotherapy is that, in general, these drugs lack selectivity for tumour versus normal 
cells and consequently have a low therapeutic index.
Data obtained in 1986 showed that approximately 48% of cancers presented in a 
localised state and therefore were suitable for treatment with surgery and / or 
radiotherapy (Souhami and Tobias, 1986). Of these around 60% were curable. In 
contrast a cure rate of only 5% was achieved with metastatic cancer. Thus there is an
1
obvious requirement for improvements in cancer therapy, and particularly in systemic 
treatments effective against disseminated disease.
It may be argued that the lack of effectiveness of many chemotherapeutic agents is a 
result of the drug discovery methods previously employed. Initially these were highly 
empirical and involved random screening of a diverse range of compounds for 
toxicity followed by analogue development. The Chester Beatty Research Institute in 
London, UK, which carried out much of this work in Britain, adopted a screen which 
involved testing compounds in vivo  for activity against a Walker tumour grown in rats 
(Rosenoer et al , 1966). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the USA also used 
rodent models in vivo  but focused on leukaemias e.g. the L1210 and P388 murine 
tumours as the preliminary screens and this may explain why agents identified as 
possessing promising activity were largely effective against leukaemias but were 
generally much less effective against solid tumours (Schwartsmann and Workman, 
1993). Despite leading to the identification of a number of currently used, active 
drugs such as cisplatin, a criticism of these models has been that they were rodent 
tumours which may not necessarily be a good indication of therapeutic activity in 
humans. In 1975 animal solid tumours and human tumour xenografts were also 
included as secondary in vivo  model systems at the NCI. However, relatively little 
success has been achieved and in recent years drug development has been considered 
to have reached a plateau of effectiveness. A few highly selective compounds were 
discovered in preclinical screens but were found to be ineffective in humans and in 
general, the currently employed drugs are what is often described as 'dirty’, that is, 
they have multiple sites of action. More encouragingly exciting breakthroughs have 
been made in understanding the molecular basis of cancer. This knowledge is now 
being exploited in current research strategies where both empirical and rational, 
mechanism-based approaches to drug development are combined. Designing drugs 
directed against specific molecular targets may overcome the problems of selectivity 
observed with the currently employed compounds. Cellular targets such as 
oncogenes, signalling molecules and the cell membrane have been identified in place 
of DNA and microtubule targets, and a wide range of compounds of both synthetic 
and natural origin are assayed against for activity against them (Workman, 1992b). 
Screens are increasingly of high throughput and may involve cell-free studies with 
purified, often recombinant, target proteins, or alternatively may involve cell lines 
which naturally or as a result of genetic modification express appropriately high levels 
of the target molecule. Following detection, lead compounds can be structurally 
modified to produce analogues with enhanced potency and selectivity.
2
As an alternative approach to strategies aimed at particular novel molecular targets the 
US NCI has recently developed a new in vitro  screen which consists of a large 
number of cell lines derived from human solid tumours. These have been well 
characterised and represent a range of tumour types (Grever et al,  1992). Agents are 
identified that have activity against particular disease types and these may be further 
tested for activity in vivo  against the same human tumours grown as xenografts in 
nude mice. Computer programmes are used to give drugs characteristic 'fingerprints' 
based on their cytotoxicity profiles on the range of cell lines. These profiles can be 
compared for different drugs. Promising new agents are selected on the basis of 
disease specificity, potency, a unique structure and antitumour profile which indicates 
a different mechanism of action from agents previously used.
In addition to these more innovative but potentially high risk approaches, elucidating 
the molecular mechanism of action of anticancer drugs which have either previously 
undergone or are presently undergoing clinical trial may permit optimisation of 
compounds to improve the therapeutic index. This knowledge may also allow the 
development of strategies to overcome undesirable side effects. The disadvantage 
with this approach is that dramatic improvements in clinical performance are unlikely.
Aside from novel drug development approaches based on small molecule 'chemical' 
approaches additional strategies are being examined for the treatment of cancer 
(Workman et al , 1992). These include principally immunotherapy, antisense 
oligonucleotides, gene therapy, hormone and growth factor treatments.
To conclude the introductory section, although significant advances have been made 
in the treatment of specific types of cancer, approximately 25% of the population still 
die of the disease, the large majority as a result of metastatic spread. This highlights 
the urgent need for major improvements in systemic chemotherapy which may now 
be possible through innovative approaches to rational drug development.
1.2 Hypoxia and Bioreductive Antitumour Agents
1.2.1 Hypoxia in Tumours
Solid tumours are known to outgrow their vascular supply (Thomlinson and Gray, 
1955; Coleman, 1988). This results in a diffusion gradient extending away from the 
capillaries along which the supply of oxygen and nutrients becomes progressively
3
decreased. Adjacent to vasculature are well oxygenated viable cells but at a distance 
of 100-200  |im from the nearest functional capillary is a population of anoxic, 
necrotic cells which receive insufficient oxygen and nutrients to maintain viability. 
Between these two extremes are cells which exist at an intermediate oxygen tension 
between fully aerated and anoxic conditions and which are known as hypoxic cells 
(Fig 1.1).
Cells which are permanently hypoxic due to the diffusion limitations described above 
are said to be chronically hypoxic. Areas also exist in experimental model tumours 
where hypoxia is more transient. This is known as acute hypoxia and results from 
microregional fluctuations in blood flow (Chaplin et al,  1986). The precise reasons 
for this phenomenon are at present unknown although suggestions include collapse of 
vessels due to high interstitial pressure in tumours (Sevick and Jain, 1989) and 
blocking of vessels by circulating blood or tumour cells (Jain, 1988).
Hypoxia is widely believed to be a therapeutic problem in solid tumours where it is 
thought to limit response to both radio and chemotherapy (Coleman, 1988). Since 
these therapy-resistant hypoxic cells are capable of repopulating a treated tumour, it is 
important to develop methods to identify and treat them.
Several methods have been employed for the detection of tumour hypoxia including 
fluorescent antibodies (Cline et al,  1990), labelled nitroimidazole hypoxic cell 
sensitisers (Urtasun et al,  1986; Franko etal,  1987), cryospectrophotometry (Mueller- 
Klieser et al,  1981), oxygen electrodes (see below), the comet assay (Olive et al,  
1993) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Rofstad et al,  1988) amongst others. 
These methods actually measure different parameters. The only technique to measure 
oxygen partial pressure directly is the oxygen electrode. Using this method strong 
evidence for hypoxia within human solid tumours has been obtained. The median 
PO2 in breast tumours was 30 mm Hg compared to 65 mm in normal breast tissue 
(Vaupel et al,  1991). Similarly an increase in the proportion of hypoxic cells has been 
observed in cervical cancer with a median value of 12 mm Hg in tumours and 48 mm 
Hg in normal cervix of nulliparous women (Hockel et al,  1991). Hypoxic regions 
have also been detected in brain tumours (Rampling et al,  1994). Intra-tumoural 
heterogeneity of pC > 2 levels has been reported for human brain tumours (Rampling et 
al, 1994) as well as in human breast and cervix tumours (Kallinowsky et al,  1990). 
The percentage of cells existing at an oxygen tension of <2.5 mm Hg is however 
thought to be the value which is of most significance radiobiologically. Pooled data 
from a study of ten patients with glioblastoma showed that 28% of readings were less

than 2.5 mm Hg (Rampling et al,  1994). In contrast, during the same study, a low 
grade tumour showed no readings of pC > 2 <2.5 mm Hg.
1.2.2 Hypoxia-induced Radioresistance and Chemoresistance
The correlation between oxygen level and radiosensitivity was first made by Petry in 
1923 (see Hall, 1978) although the effect had been observed previously by a number 
of other workers without realisation of the significance. Oxygen has been shown to 
sensitise both bacterial systems and mammalian cells to radiation when it is present 
either during or within a few milliseconds of radiation (see Hall, 1978). The nature of 
the oxygen effect is not fully understood but can be explained by the oxygen fixation 
hypothesis. This is based upon the fact that radiation induces formation of free 
radicals which may cause biological damage. In the presence of oxygen these free 
radicals can react to form organic peroxides which lead to a more permanent form of 
damage which can not be so easily repaired, e.g. by thiols (see Hall, 1978).
Studies performed to determine the amount of oxygen required for radiation 
sensitisation found little difference in radiation response between 12 mm Hg and 600 
mm Hg oxygen tension. A rapid decrease in sensitivity occurs below 30 mm Hg. 
Fully oxygenated cells are approximately 3 times more sensitive to radiation than 
their anoxic counterparts (see Hall, 1978).
In 1955, whilst examining histological sections of lung carcinoma, Thomlinson and 
Gray discovered that the thickness of the viable cells in a solid tumour was always 
between 100-180 pm. At greater distances from the capillary cells were necrotic. 
This coincided with the calculated diffusion distance of oxygen which was estimated 
to fall to zero between 150-180 pm from the blood vessel. These findings suggested 
that hypoxic cells may exist within human tumours and led to a renewed interest in 
radiation insensitivity and hypoxia. Studies carried out using oxygen electrodes in 
breast, cervical carcinoma (Hockel et al,  1993) and head and neck cancer (Gatenby et 
al, 1988) have shown a good correlation between hypoxia and response to 
radiotherapy.
In addition to being hypoxic, solid tumours were also thought to be acidic in nature. 
This theory originally arose from work carried out by Warburg and co-workers in 
1930 (see Griffiths, 1991) who reported a preferential conversion of glucose to lactic 
acid in tumours. Initial studies using pH electrodes confirmed this belief (reviewed in 
Wike Hooley et al,  1984 and Vaupel et al,  1989). However due to the relatively large
5
size of the micro-electrode compared to the cell, such measurements tend to reflect 
the extracellular pH (Vaupel et al , 1989). More recent studies have employed 31P 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, a non-invasive technique that enables 
measurement of intracellular pH (Griffiths, 1983). These have revealed that, if 
anything, the intracellular pH of tumours is neutral to slightly alkaline. It has been 
suggested that intracellular pH may be regulated by export systems of the cell which 
would result in a higher acidity of the extracellular fluid whilst still retaining 
intracellular pH at near neutrality (Griffiths, 1991).
A number of strategies have been developed to circumvent the problem of tumour 
hypoxia. These include:-
• fractionated radiotherapy
• increasing oxygen supply to the tumour
• radiation sensitisers
• hypoxia-activated cytotoxins
These different approaches will be discussed briefly in turn.
Fractionated radiotherapy works on the principal that oxic cells in the proximity of 
tumour vasculature will be killed by radiation thus permitting reoxygenation of 
previously hypoxic cells at a greater distance from the blood supply. Cells in these 
areas will then be killed by successive cycles of radiation (see Hall et al, 1978).
Attempts have been made to confer radiation sensitivity by increasing tumour
oxygenation. Techniques employed include oxygen or carbogen breathing under 
ztnormobaric or hypftbaric conditions (Suit et al,  1972), blood flow modifiers, (e.g. 
Hirst et al,  1993), perfluorochemical carriers (Coleman, 1988) and calcium 
antagonists (Kaelin, 1982). These approaches may have use in chronic hypoxia but 
are likely to provide only limited benefit with acute hypoxia.
Radiation sensitisers as their name suggests are chemicals which are able to sensitise 
the tumour cells to radiation therapy. Nitroimidazole compounds have been shown to 
function as effective radiation sensitisers in vivo.  One of these agents, metronidazole 
(l-P-hydroxyethyl-2-methyl-5-nitro-imidazole), a 5-nitroimidazole compound, has 
been employed clinically as an antiparasitic drug (see Hall et al,  1978), This agent 
entered clinical trial for the treatment of cancer but was subsequently found to be less 
potent than some 2-nitroimidazoles such as misonidazole [a-(methoxymethyl)- 2- 
nitro-lH-imidazole-1 -ethanol] (see Workman and Stratford, 1993). Metronidazole
6
penetrated well into tumours and substantial sensitisation was reported in 
experimental tumours. Despite some evidence of clinical sensitisation the use of this 
agent was limited due to the peripheral and central neurotoxicity (Dische, 1985). 
Analogues of misonidazole, etanidazole [lH -im idazole-l-acetam ide, N-(2- 
hydroxyethyl)-2-nitro , SR 250£), and pimonidazole [Ro 03-8799; l-(2- 
nitroimidazole-l-yl)-3-(l-piperidino)-2-propanol] were subsequently developed in 
attempt to increase sensitisation whilst reducing toxicity. Phase III randomised 
clinical trials of these compounds are now underway. Etanidazole is more 
hydrophilic than misonidazole, is absorbed more slowly into the brain and peripheral 
nerves and thus causes less neurotoxicity (Brown and Workman, 1980). This 
compound is equally potent to misonidazole as a radiation sensitiser and can be given 
at three times the dose of misonidazole (Coleman et al , 1987). Pimonidazole 
possesses greater sensitising ability than misonidazole but is lipophilic, basic and 
readily accumulates in the tumour tissue (Newman et al,  1988). In contrast to 
etanidazole, the dose-limiting toxicity of pimonidazole is an acute CNS syndrome but 
this agent does not cause peripheral neuropathy (Roberts et al,  1980). As a result of 
their different toxic mechanisms and an additive radiosensitisation of pimonidazole 
and etanidazole in murine models clinical trials of the two agents in combination 
chemotherapy were initiated (Bleehen et al,  1989).
Other radiation sensitisers include a 5-nitroimidazole, nimorazole [4-[2-(5- 
nitroimidazole-l-yl) ethyl] morpholine] which has shown some activity in clinical 
trial (Overgaard et al,  1991) and RSU 1069 [(l-2-nitro-l-imidazoyl)-2-(l-aziridinyl)- 
2-propanol] (Fig 1.2). The latter compound is a mixed function agent containing a 
nitro group which provides sensitising ability as well as an aziridine moiety which 
gives it the capacity to act as a bifunctional hypoxic cell cytotoxin following reductive 
activation (Jenkins et al,  1990). Phase I clinical trial of RSU 1069 (Horwich et al,  
1986) revealed dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity. Recently a prodrug of RSU 
1069, RB 6145 [lH-imidazole-1-ethanol,a-([2-bromoethyl amino] methyl)-2-nitro, 
monohydrobromide] has been developed with a bromoethyl side chain (Jenkins et al,  
1990). Radiosensitisation has been observed with this agent in animal models 
(Adams et al,  1992) and clinical trials are awaited with one of the enantiomers.
These radiation sensitisers were found to have activity dependent on their redox 
potential or 'electron affinity' and thus were known as electron-affinic radiosensitisers. 
A comprehensive review by Adams^(1992) summarises the characteristics and 
mechanisms of action of these agents. In brief, one-electron reduction potential was 
found to reflect the radiosensitising efficiency of the compounds. It has been

proposed that the radiation sensitiser localises close to DNA, traps electrons generated 
by radiation and thus affects the distribution of free radical centres on DNA. This 
then leads to DNA damage. The review by Adams also discusses the ability of 
radiation sensitisers to act as bioreductive anticancer agents. This feature is also 
related to electron affinity but occurs by different mechanisms to those which cause 
radiation sensistisation.
1.2.3 Bioreductive Anticancer Agents
Bioreductive anticancer agents, by definition, are compounds which require metabolic 
reduction to generate their toxic species. Although hypoxia is not actually required 
for bioreductive activation, preferential metabolism to the cytotoxic species often 
occurs under low oxygen conditions. This is due to enhanced stability of oxygen 
sensitive metabolites.
The main bioreductive agents employed in cancer therapy may roughly be divided 
into three main categories, namely nitro compounds, N-oxides and quinone 
compounds. In addition various novel agents can be grouped into a final 
miscellaneous category. The chemical structures of key compounds which fall into 
these categories are shown in Fig 1.2.
Nitro Compounds
In addition to their activity as radiation sensitisers the nitroimidazoles were also found 
to exhibit activity as bioreductively activated hypoxic cell cytotoxins. Misonidazole 
showed an 11 fold increase in toxicity in V79 cells under hypoxic compared with oxic 
conditions. Metronidazole is less electron affinic with a hypoxic : oxic cytotoxicity 
ratio (HCR) of 2 whereas that of the highly electron affinic nitrofurazone was 8.5 
(Stratford and Stephens, 1989).
As described previously, misonidazole was modified by replacing the methoxy group 
with an aziridine moiety to generate RSU 1069 (Adams et al,  1984) . The aziridine 
group provides an alkylating moiety and gives improved potency and selectivity as a 
hypoxic cell cytotoxin (Silver and O'Neill, 1986). The HCR increased to 67 for V79 
cells and this was attributed to the bifunctional character of the compound (Stratford 
and Stephens, 1989). The bromoethyl prodrug of RSU 1069, RB 6145 retains 
hypoxic cell selectivity whilst showing reduced toxicity in animals (Jenkins et al,
1990).
8
Nitroimidazole activation is believed to be a multistep process involving a variety of 
enzymes. The cytotoxic metabolites are thought to be the one-electron reduced nitro 
anion radical, the two-electron reduced nitroso and the four-electron reduced 
hydroxylamine. The six-electron reduced amine derivative is not considered to be 
important in the mechanism of cytotoxicity (see Workman, 1992a). Under aerobic 
conditions free radical generation following redox cycling of the radical anions may 
predominate. The ultimate DNA alkylating species is undetermined but is believed to 
be generated from the nitroso or hydroxylamine or their ring-opened cleavage 
products under hypoxic conditions. In the case of aziridinyl nitroimidazoles e.g. RSU 
1069 the possession of two reactive centres, the reduced nitro group and the aziridine, 
provide sites for alkylation of DNA and thereby DNA cross-linking (Silver and 
O'Neill, 1986).
Another nitro compound which sensitises hypoxic cells (Stratford et al,  1981) is CB 
1954 (Fig 1.2; 5-(aziridin-l-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide). In addition to its 
radiosensitising ability CB 1954 also acts as a hypoxic cell cytotoxin. Although this 
agent was highly potent and selective in its activity against the rat Walker tumour 
(Khan and Ross, 1969 / 1970) it did not display any significant effect against other 
transplantable tumours (Cobb et al,  1969; Connors and Melzack, 1971). CB 1954 did 
however cause only minimal haematological toxicity but at toxic doses damage to the 
liver and urinary tract was observed (Cobb, 1970).
Despite the lack of antitumour activity displayed against a range of animal and human 
tumour xenografts (Workman et al,  1986), CB 1954 was entered in to clinical trial in 
the 1970's (see Knox et al,  1993) as a result of the extraordinarily high therapeutic 
index observed in the Walker tumour model. Toxicity was minimal with diarrhoea 
being the most significant side effect. No bone marrow toxicity or liver dysfunction 
was noted. However, disappointingly, no tumour regression was observed and CB 
1954 was labelled as ' a drug in search of a human tumour to treat' (Workman et al,  
1986).
N-oxides
The lead compound of the benzotriazine di-N-oxides is SR 4233 (3-amino-1, 2, 4- 
benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide; WIN 59075) also known as tirapazamine (Fig 1.2). This 
agent exhibits a high degree of hypoxic cell selectivity in vitro  (Zeman et al,  1986;
9
Costa et al,  1989; Zeman et al,  1989) with HCRs as large as 75-200 and 15-50 being 
reported for rodent and human tumour cells respectively (Zeman et al,  1986). Unlike 
many other hypoxic cell cytotoxins SR 4233 shows an increased cytotoxic potency 
over a wider range of oxygen concentrations (Koch, 1993). In addition to its activity 
in vitro  SR 4233 also appears to act as an effective antitumour agent in experimental 
tumours in vivo.  Thus it caused extensive cell death when used in combination with 
fractionated radiotherapy (Zeman et al,  1988; Brown and Lemmon, 1990) or with 
agents which induce tumour hypoxia (Sun and Brown, 1989). SR 4233 is currently 
undergoing phase I clinical trial in Glasgow, UK, Stanford and Harvard, USA.
Several enzymes are involved in the bioreductive activation of SR 4233 including 
cytochromes P450 (Walton and Workman, 1990; Walton et al,  1992c), cytochrome 
P450 reductase (Cahill and White, 1990; Lloyd et al,  1991, Walton et al,  1992c), 
xanthine oxidase (Walton and Workman, 1990), aldehyde oxidase (Walton and 
Workman, 1990) and DT-diaphorase (see Section 1.4). Experiments using mouse 
liver microsomes indicate that cytochromes P450s, particularly the subfamilies IIB, 
IIC and IIIA, are the most important enzymes involved in metabolism of SR 4233 
(Walton et al,  1992c). Other authors have found somewhat different results and it 
appears that the involvement of particular enzymes in activation of SR 4233 may 
differ between species and with oxygen status.
HPLC studies have detected the two (SR 4317) and four-electron (SR 4330) reduced 
compounds as the predominant metabolites (Baker et al,  1988; Walton and Workman,
1990). Neither of these species was found to be toxic (Baker et al,  1988; Costa et al,  
1989). It was therefore suggested that SR 4233 is metabolised to form SR 4317 via a 
radical intermediate (Lloyd et al,  1991), which, in the presence of air, is thought to 
undergo auto-oxidation and redox cycling to generate oxygen radicals. Under 
hypoxia it has been proposed that the intermediate is able to gain a second electron by 
extracting hydrogen from DNA and thus forms the stable mono-N-oxide SR 4317 
while concomitantly causing DNA double strand breaks (Costa et al,  1989). This 
damage is believed to be responsible for the cytotoxicity observed.
Analogues of SR 4233 are also being investigated. One of these, the 3-desamino 
analogue is also highly potent but has reduced systemic toxicity (Zeman et al,  1989). 
Further studies are in progress.
10
Quinones
Quinone compounds are widely distributed in nature and a large number of both 
naturally occurring and synthetic quinones has been screened for antitumour activity. 
Several promising compounds were identified and have entered clinical trial including 
streptonigrin, mitoxantrone, mitomycin C (Fig 1.2), adriamycin and the aziridinyl- 
benzoquinones.
Many of these quinones are bioreductive alkylating agents, that is they possess groups 
which, following reduction, are capable of alkylating cellular targets. The prototype 
bioreductive alkylating agent is the quinone-containing antibiotic mitomycin C. This 
compound was first isolated in 1958 from Streptomyces caespitosis  by Wakaki and 
co-workers at the Kyowa Fermentation Institute, Japan (Wakaki et al , 1958). 
Antitumour activity was noted and in 1960 clinical trials of mitomycin C were carried 
out in Japan. Myelosuppression and resistance were observed; however, by altering 
the dose schedule these problems were reduced and mitomycin C was approved for 
clinical use in the USA by 1974.
The literature contains many reports of clinical trials involving mitomycin C. It is 
effective against a number of tumours where it is commonly used in combination 
chemotherapy regimes. Activity has been observed in gastrointestinal tract cancer 
and particularly in stomach cancer where it is used as part of the FAM regime (5- 
fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C). It also has a role in the treatment of both 
superficial and bladder cancer in situ  where it is administered by intravesical 
installation therapy, as second and third line therapy in breast cancer and in non-small 
cell lung carcinoma (Veeder et al,  1992) where it is given in combination with 
cisplatin and ifosphamide. Some single agent activity has been observed in prostate 
cancer. The main problem with mitomycin C is a delayed and somewhat 
unpredictable myelosuppression.
Mitomycin C acts as a potent cell cytotoxin in vitro  and exhibits selective toxicity 
towards hypoxic cells (Iyer and Szybalski; 1963; Kennedy et al,  1980; Rockwell et al,  
1982; Rauth et al,  1983). The hypoxic : oxic cytotoxicity ratio is however lower than 
that of many of the other bioreductive anticancer agents and for some cell lines no 
enhancement in potency was observed (Keyes et al,  1984). Some hypoxic cell 
selectivity has been observed for mitomycin C in experimental tumours in vivo  
(Rockwell and Kennedy, 1979; Rockwell, 1983).
11
Several enzymes have been identified as being able to catalyse reduction of 
mitomycin C including NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase (Bachur et al,  1979; Pan 
et al,  1984), xanthine oxidase (Pan et al,  1984; Bligh et al,  1990), xanthine 
dehydrogenase (Gustafson and Pritsos, 1992a and b) and DT-diaphorase (see Section 
1.4). The precise mode of reduction and the identity of the cytotoxic species are not 
fully understood but it appears that they may differ under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions.
The cytotoxic mechanism of mitomycin C is thought mainly to involve DNA damage 
via alkylation with oxygen radical damage also being important in air. Following 
either one or two-electron reduction the Cl position of the aziridine moiety is 
activated and can form an adduct with guanine at the N-2 position (Iyer and 
Szybalski, 1963). Loss of the carbamate group generates a second reactive centre at 
C-10 which can form an adduct with guanine N-2 to generate a cross-link in the minor 
groove of DNA (Tomasz etal,  1987).
Several aziridinylbenzoquinones have undergone development as anticancer agents 
including trenimon (triaziquone; 2,3,5-tris (aziridinyl)-l,4-benzoquinone), 
carbaziliquone (carboquone; 2,5-bis(l-aziridinyl)-3-(2-carbam oyloxy-l- 
m ethoxyethyl-)-6-m ethyl-l,4 benzoquinone), AZQ (diaziquone; 3,6- 
bis(carboxyamino)-2,5-diaziridinyl-l,4-benzoquinone) and BZQ (3,6-bis[(2- 
hydroxyethly)amino]-2,5-diaziridinyl-l,4-benzoquinone). AZQ (Fig 1.2) was 
synthesised by Driscoll and co-workers in 1976 (Chou et al,  1976) at the NCI 
following a screening programme in which aziridinyl compounds showed activity in a 
number of murine tumour models. It was designed to have high lipid solubility and 
low ionisation potential to aid passage across the blood-brain barrier whilst being 
water soluble to facilitate formulation. The carboethoxyamino groups confer lipid 
solubility whilst the quinone and aziridine moieties allow reductive activation and 
alkylation reactions to occur respectively. BZQ was also synthesised by Chou and co­
workers (1976). This has greater lipid solubility than AZQ and is more easily 
synthesised.
In animal models AZQ was active against intraperitoneal L1210 leukaemia, P388 
leukaemia and B 16 melanoma (O'Brien, 1985) as well as against murine intracranially 
and intraperitoneally implanted tumours (Driscoll, 1979). Experiments carried out in 
vivo in athymic mice found AZQ to be active against human glioma and 
medulloblastoma. An increase in growth delay was observed when it was combined 
with carmustine or procarbazine but only slight enhancement of therapeutic effect was
12
seen when combined with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin or vincristine (Schold et al,  
1984).
Human Phase I, II and III clinical trials have been performed. As a single agent AZQ 
showed activity in brain tumours (Castleberry et al,  1990; Berg et al,  1992) and in 
acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia as a second line or consolidation therapy in first 
remission patients when given as a continuous infusion (Lee et al,  1986; Schulman et 
al, 1987). Little effect has been reported against other tumour types. Dose-limiting 
toxicity consisted of delayed myelosuppression and thrombocytopaenia with few non- 
haematological side effects (Schilsky et al,  1982). The plasma clearance is fairly 
rapid with a half-life of 30 minutes (Schilsky et al,  1982). AZQ has also been 
investigated as an agent in combination chemotherapy e.g. with 2,2-anhydro- 
arabinosyl-5-fluorocytosine (Meyers et al,  1989) and etoposide (Lee et al,  1990).
AZQ, like mitomycin C, possesses the quinone and aziridine moieties, thus suggesting 
that bioreductive alkylation may be involved in its mechanism of cytotoxicity. It is 
highly cytotoxic with a large variation in potency being observed between cell lines 
and exhibits selectivity towards hypoxic cells (for detail see Chapter 7). This was 
most marked below 0.6 mm Hg oxygen concentration.
Reduction has been suggested to be important for AZQ activation. Evidence for AZQ 
metabolism within intact cells has been provided by electron spin resonance (ESR) 
experiments (Gutierrez et al,  1985). Further studies have shown that microsomes, rat 
liver nuclei, purified NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase (Gutierrez et al,  1982; 
Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a) and DT-diaphorase (Siegel et al,  1990a; Ross et al,  
1990; Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a and b) are all able to catalyse reduction of this 
compound.
The mechanism of cytotoxicity is believed to involve DNA damage. Following 
treatment of cells with AZQ both DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links have 
been detected (King et al,  1984; Szmigiero et al,  1984) although cell killing correlates 
with cross-link formation rather than strand break induction. It has been suggested 
that cross-link formation may involve alkylation through the aziridine groups with 
activation to the DNA damaging species occurring in the nucleus (King et al,  1984). 
Indeed in isolated nuclei and in the presence of cofactor AZQ has been shown to 
induce strand breaks via oxygen radical formation as well as interstrand cross-links 
(Szmigiero and Kohn, 1984). With isolated DNA, AZQ caused both DNA strand
13
breaks and DNA interstrand cross-links when chemically reduced (King et al,  1984) 
or enzymatically using DT-diaphorase (Lee et al,  1992).
AZQ may induce cytotoxicity via a number of mechanisms including free radical 
damage and / or alkylation following reductive activation. The enzyme profile of the 
cell will determine the spectrum of metabolites generated and might therefore 
influence sensitivity towards this agent.
E09 [(3-hydroxy-5-aziridinyl-l-methyl-2-(lH-indole-4, 7-dione)prop-p-en-oc-ol) ; 
Fig 1.2] is the lead compound in a series of novel indoloquinone anticancer agents 
synthesised by Oostveen and Speckamp (1987) at the Free University Hospital in 
Amsterdam. Its structural similarity to mitomycin C suggests that it may also undergo 
bioreductive activation to form an alkylating agent. However it exhibits a different 
antitumour profile from mitomycin C, being generally a more potent cytotoxin with 
particular preference for solid tumours over leukaemias (Hendriks et al,  1993). It also 
has the advantage of showing an improved hypoxic cell selectivity (for further 
information see Chapter 4). As discussed previously (Section 1.2) tumour pH may 
also play a role in antitumour activity. In a similar manner to mitomycin C, 
decreasing pH has been found to increase the cytotoxic potency of E09 and to 
decrease stability of the drug (Phillips et al,  1992). It is presently unclear how pH 
will affect the activity of E09 in vivo.
An indication of possible solid tumour selectivity of E09 in vivo  came from studies 
using the Corbett two tumour assay (Hendriks et al,  1993). This involves examining 
the sensitivity of tumour cell lines derived directly from solid tumours. Further 
experiments using OC-Tol small cell lung carcinoma cells (Roed et al,  1989) have 
also suggested that the cytotoxicity data obtained in vitro  correlates well with activity 
seen in vivo.
The activity of E09 was assessed in a range of animal models. This agent was 
inactive against the P388 murine leukaemia as well as the ascetic murine tumour 
MAC 15 and subcutaneous MAC 13. Moderate activity was however detected 
against the mouse colon carcinomas MAC 16 and MAC 26 (Walton et al,  1992a; 
Hendriks et al,  1993).
Antitumour activity was also investigated using human tumour xenografts (Hendriks 
et al,  1993). E09 was administered to the tumour-bearing mice at a dose of 4-6 
mg/kg by intravenous injection at days 0 and 7. No antitumour activity was observed
14
in the renal RXF 243 xenograft whereas a growth delay was detected in the breast 
MAXF449 and LXFL 329 tumours and regression was seen in gastric GXF97 and 
ovarian MRI-H-207 xenografts. Similar experiments carried out with mitomycin C 
indicated a comparable antitumour profile in the tumour xenografts.
Toxicology and pharmacokinetics of E09 administered to mice and rats were 
examined (Hendriks et al,  1993). In C3H/HE mice side effects observed following a 
single i.v. injection of the drug included transient sluggishness with piloerection, 
pallor and transient irritation at the injection site. Interestingly however, no bone 
marrow toxicity was detected. The LD 50 values were 12.99 mg/kg in male mice and 
13.95 mg/kg in female mice with death occurring between 3 and 25 days following 
drug administration. Again where mice were given multiple dose regimes at 1.5 
mg/kg no drug related death or bone marrow toxicity was detectable. Side effects 
included temporary anaemia, decrease in overall body weight as well as changes in 
the weight of other organs including testes, spleen, kidney and liver, congested blood 
vessels and haemorrhagic spots on the jejunum. Rats were injected i.v. with a single 
dose of E09 corresponding to the LD 10 obtained in mice (2.7 mg/m2). This was 
found to be safe with no display of toxicity. Where multiple injections (2.7 mg/m2) 
were given to rats the only detectable problem was inflammation at the injection site. 
Dose-limiting toxicity in animal studies was gastrointestinal. As a result of these 
animal studies a starting dose of 2.7 mg/kg- was recommended for the human clinical 
trial.
Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were also carried out in rats, mice (Binger and 
Workman, 1990; Workman et al,  1992) and finally in a small number of beagle dogs 
(see Workman et al,  1992). Interestingly the half-life of E09 (1.9 minutes) in mice is 
far less than that of mitomycin C (16 minutes) and plasma levels achieved are four 
times higher for mitomycin C. It is possible that the reduced cytotoxicity in vitro  
(Hendriks et al,  1993), increased half-life and plasma levels seen with mitomycin C 
compared with E09 may be due to a decreased rate of metabolism. In beagle dogs 
(Workman and Binger, personal communication) a higher plasma concentration was 
achieved than in mice and also a longer half-life. In addition, the low toxicity 
observed suggested that doses of E09 required for activity could be attained.
Following the extensive preclinical evaluation, in vivo  E09 was taken into clinical 
trial. Phase I studies were carried out on patients aged between 45 and 73 bearing 
solid tumours (Schellens et al,  1993, 1994). Most were colo-rectal tumours and 
patients had received prior chemo or radiotherapy. E09 was administered as an i.v.
15
infusion for 5 minutes at 3 weekly intervals. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained. A 
wide variation between patients was observed with a range of total plasma clearance 
values of 3.2 to 9.7 1/minute. Elimination from the central compartment was rapid 
and non-linear with a terminal half-life of 0.8 to 19 minutes, protein binding was 62+ 
8%. Negligible amounts of E09 and the hydrolysis product E05A were found in the 
urine. Drug levels attained were higher than those achieved in animal models. Dose- 
limiting toxicity occurred at 27 mg/ and was proteinuria associated with temporary 
oedema, sodium and water retention and serum creatine increase. Hypertension also 
occurred in 2 of the patients. Moderate nausea and vomiting but no bone marrow 
toxicity was observed. Most symptoms were reversible at day 15. Results appeared 
promising with partial responses being observed. One patient bearing an 
adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin showed a 50% reduction in tumour size 
and a second also with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin showed a 50% 
reduction of lung metastasis and stabilisation in liver metastasis. Finally a third 
patient with bile duct cancer exhibited a 45% tumour reduction in liver metastasis.
A second phase I clinical trial using a different schedule and phase II trials are now 
underway .
Novel Compounds
In addition to the bioreductive agents described efforts have been initiated to develop 
novel types of compounds. Denny's group have examined the possibility of using 
prodrugs that are activated under hypoxia to deliver diffusible cytotoxins which 
would kill adjacent cells (Denny and Wilson, 1993). This could overcome the 
problem of cells which are at an oxygen pressure low enough to be sensitive to 
radiation but too high to activate the bioreductive drugs. Denny and Wilson (1993) 
suggested that the compound should be activated to an initial one-electron reduced 
intermediate that would be sensitive to oxygen and thus selective activation would 
only occur in hypoxic cells. The ultimate cytotoxic species should however not be 
affected by oxygen status, pH or cell cycle and thus could diffuse out of the activating 
hypoxic cell to kill adjacent oxic cells.
Mustard compounds fit the criteria outlined above. The addition of either a nitro 
group or cobalt (III) to form nitro-deactivated aromatic mustards or cobalt (III) 
complexed deactivated aliphatic mustards provides compounds which can be 
activated following reduction. Development of these drugs is presently underway.
16
Another approach is to use DNA intercalators. Wilson et al  (1992) described a 
nitroacridine which although being active in vitro  was poor in vivo  . The failure of 
the nitroacridines is thought to be due to the fact that they are such potent intercalators 
that their extravascular diffusion to the chronically hypoxic region of the tumour is 
limited.
Patterson (1993) has examined the potential of developing bioreductive drugs which 
are active against acute hypoxia. Anthraquinones have been developed to fulfil these 
requirements, of which the lead compound is the N-oxide prodrug, 1,4-bis{[2- 
(dimethyl-amino-N-oxide)ethyl]-amino}  5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione 
(AQ4N). Under hypoxic conditions this can be reduced to AQ4 which is stable in air 
and is DNA-affinic.
1.2.4 Enzymes Involved in Bioreductive Activation of Anticancer Agents
Numerous enzymes can catalyse the reduction of bioreductive agents. The main ones 
will be discussed in turn, with particular emphasis on DT-diaphorase which is a 
central focus of this thesis.
Xanthine Oxidase and Dehydrogenase
Xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase convert xanthine to uric acid. During this 
process NAD is reduced to NADH by xanthine dehydrogenase and superoxide is 
produced by xanthine oxidase. Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204) is more 
prevalent in the cell than is xanthine oxidase (Battelli et al,  1972; Anderson et al,  
1989). Xanthine dehydrogenase exists as a dimer with one flavin adenine 
dinucleotide molecule and two iron-sulphur centres (Amaya et al,  1990) and may 
undergo oxidation or proteolytic cleavage to form xanthine oxidase (Porras et al,  
1981). This may also occur during purification, thus rendering separation of the two 
enzymes difficult. The proteolytic conversion is irreversible and it has been 
suggested that this may involve a Ca2+-activated protease (McCord, 1985) whereas 
the oxidative conversion is reversible and occurs via reduction of oxidised thiols 
(Stripe and Della Corte, 1969).
Studies involving purified preparations of xanthine oxidase and xanthine 
dehydrogenase have found both enzymes to be capable of metabolising mitomycin C 
(for references see Section 1.2.3).
17
Doxorubicin in vivo  increases both xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase 
activities in rat kidney and it appears that this is due to an increase in protein levels 
(Ghiggeri et al , 1990). Cardiac tissue levels of xanthine oxidase in the mouse are also 
increased following exposure to doxorubicin (Gustafson et al,  1991). These authors 
suggested that this resulted from a conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to the 
oxidase form.
Carbonyl Reductase
Carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) is a cytosolic, monomeric NADPH-dependent 
oxidoreductase. It exhibits a broad substrate specificity (Jarabak et al,  1991) and 
metabolises a variety of quinone compounds including menadione (Wermuth et al,
1986) A number of K-region and non-K-region polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon o- 
quinones and their glutathione adducts (Jarabak et al,  1991) as well as benzo and 
naptho-quinones (Wermuth et al,  1986) act as the best substrates. The enzyme has 
been purified from a number of sources including human, pig and chicken (see 
Wermuth et al,  1986) The carbonyl reductase isolated from human liver and brain has 
been found to consist of multiple molecular forms and enzyme from both sources 
were able to metabolise a wide range of quinone substrates with equal efficiency 
(Wermuth et al,  1986). The enzyme is also maintained in permanent cell lines (Gebel 
and Maser, 1992). Little is as yet known about its physiological role although it has 
been suggested that it may be involved in quinone metabolism (Wermuth et al,  1986). 
Wermuth and co-workers (1986) have suggested that although DT-diaphorase may be 
the principal two-electron transferring quinone reductase in rat liver, carbonyl 
reductase may be more important for this role in human liver. The enzyme is 
selectively inhibited by rutin (Wermuth, 1981) and quercetin (Felsted and Bachur, 
1980) although there are also indications that indomethacin and dicoumarol may 
inhibit carbonyl reductase (see Gebel and Maser, 1992)
Dihydrodiol Dehydrogenase
Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.20) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that oxidises 
aromatic dihydrodiols to catechols. It utilises NADPH as a cofactor (see Klein et al,
1992). In addition to metabolism of the dihyrodiols, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 
purified from rat liver reduces a range of quinone compounds although menadione 
itself is not a substrate. Redox cycling with concomitant generation of toxic radicals 
has also been observed during quinone reduction catalysed by this enzyme (Klein et 
al, 1992)
18
Cytochrome P450
The cytochromes P450 are haem proteins which absorb at 450 nm on binding of 
carbon monoxide and show considerable inter- and intraspecies variation. The human 
cytochrome P450 superfamily is comprised of at least 20 genes, the protein products 
of which have a wide substrate specificity. These enzymes catalyse a number of 
reactions including hydroxylations, dehalogenations, dealkylations, deaminations and 
reductions. Each family member has its own characteristic substrates and regulatory 
mechanisms although some overlap does exist between enzymes. Regulation may be 
controlled at the transcriptional level (Gonzalez and Nebert, 1990) by methods 
involving the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (Ah), xenobiotic response element 
(XRE) and steroids or may involve other mechanisms such as substrate-induced 
protein stabilisation e.g. by ethanol (Gonzalez and Nebert, 1990). Carbon monoxide 
acts as an inhibitor of cytochromes P450 and therefore of microsomal oxidations. In 
contrast cyanide inhibits mitochondrial oxidation.
NADPH: Cytochrome P450 Reductase
NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase (cytochrome c reductase; NADPH: 
ferricytochrome oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.2.4) is an 80 kD flavoprotein which has 
activity linked to cytochrome P450 (Haniu et al,  1986). The two enzymes usually 
exist together in the endoplasmic reticulum (Hall et al,  1989) although cytochrome 
P450 reductase can occur and function alone. NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase 
supplies electrons to both mitochondrial cytochrome P450 and enzymes involved in 
fatty acid metabolism (Ilan et al,  1981; Dailey and Strittmatter, 1980). It has been 
reported to exist in a number of tissues including human and rat brain (Ghershi-Egea,
1993). This enzyme has been shown to metabolise a number of bioreductive drugs 
including SR 4233 (Cahill and White, 1990; Walton et al,  1992c), mitomycin C 
(Bachur et al,  1979) and AZQ (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a).
NADH-Cytochrome b$ Reductase
NADH-cytochrome b$ reductase is an oxidoreductase associated with the 
haemeprotein cytochrome bs. It contains one FAD group (Strittmatter, 1965), is 
located on the outer membrane of mitochondria and utilises external NADH as an 
electron donor. NADH-cytochrome b$ reductase can catalyse reduction of 
ferricyanide and quinones.
19
Nitric Oxide Synthase
Nitric oxide synthase (EC. 1.14.13.39) consists of a number of isoforms all of which 
are dimeric proteins with molecular weights ranging from 130 kD - 160 kD. They act 
to convert L-arginine to nitric oxide, an endogenous vasodilator. Modulation of nitric 
oxide synthase by drugs e.g. Nitro-L-arginine (Wood et al,  1993) may therefore alter 
tumour sensitivity to both radiation and bioreductive drugs. In addition protein 
sequencing data has shown significant amino acid homology between the C terminus 
of the enzyme and that of rat liver NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase (Bredt et al,
1991). Thus it is possible that nitric oxide synthase may be capable of metabolising 
bioreductive drugs.
1.3 DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H: (quinone acceptor) oxidoreductase
(NQO) (E.C. 1.6.99.2))
1.3.1 Historical Background and Characteristics
DT-diaphorase was first discovered in 1955-6 by Emster and Navazio whilst studying 
the intracellular distribution of NAD and NADP-dependent dehydrogenases and was 
reported by these authors in 1958. The enzyme was found to utilise the cofactors 
NADH and NADPH with equal efficiency (Emster and Navazio, 1958), to be present 
in the cytosol and to be inhibited by a variety of compounds. DT-diaphorase was 
subsequently purified and characterised (Emster et al,  1962). It was highly sensitive 
to inhibition by dicoumarol (Ernster et al,  1962), a property which was consistent 
with a previously described enzyme vitamin K reductase (see Emster, 1987). Despite 
original differences in other properties described for the two enzymes later reports 
indicated that the two enzymes were in fact identical.
The enzyme was originally named DT-diaphorase (Emster et al,  1962) due to its 
ability to utilise both NADH and NADPH, formerly known as DPNH and TPNH, as 
cofactors. Subsequently it has been referred to by a variety of other names including 
vitamin K reductase, phylloquinone reductase, menadione reductase, quinone 
reductase, nicotinamide menadione oxidoreductase (NMOR) and NAD(P)H: (quinone 
acceptor) oxidoreductase (NQOl) (E.C. 1.6.99.2).
DT-diaphorase is a dimeric flavoenzyme consisting of two equally sized (32 kD) 
subunits and binding two molecules of FAD (Hojeberg et al,  1981). It is capable of
20
catalysing direct two-electron reduction (Iyanagi and Yamazaki, 1970). Although the 
mechanism of electron transfer is not yet definitively established it has been suggested 
that two rapid, successive one-electron reduction reactions may occur while the 
substrate remains bound to the enzyme (Iyanagi, 1987).
DT-diaphorase is widely distributed in the animal kingdom where both inter and intra­
species variation has been observed (see Emster, 1987; Lind et al,  1973).
The physiological role for DT-diaphorase is not clear. It has however been suggested 
that it may be involved in quinone detoxification as well as in the vitamin In­
dependent carboxylation of prothrombin (see Ernster, 1987).
Quinones, as discussed previously, commonly exert their toxicity via the semiquinone 
radical and / or oxygen radicals formed during redox cycling. Two-electron reduction 
catalysed by DT-diaphorase would bypass this toxic pathway, thus acting as a 
detoxification mechanism. In support of this theory is the observation that the toxicity 
of some quinones e.g. menadione (Roberts et al,  1989) and streptonigrin (Hochstein 
unpublished data in Emster, 1967) is enhanced by the DT-diaphorase inhibitor 
dicoumarol. In addition, treatment of rats with compounds such as azo dyes led to an 
increase in DT-diaphorase levels and subsequently to induced resistance and reduced 
carcinogenic effects of these compounds (Huggins et al,  1965). The initial interest for 
a role of DT-diaphorase in vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of prothrombin came 
from the finding that dicoumarol and other oral anticoagulants were able to inhibit 
DT-diaphorase. This role is as yet unconfirmed.
1.3.2 Purification
The first reports of DT-diaphorase purification date back to the 1960s when the 
enzyme was isolated from both rat (Ernster et al,  1960) and beef liver (see 
Ernster, 1987). Subsequently, however, DT-diaphorase has also been purified from a 
range of sources and from both induced and uninduced animals. Initially 
conventional purification methods were employed which involved largely acetone 
precipitation, fractionation with ammonium sulphate and DEAE-cellulose 
chromatography (Ernster, 1967). Several modifications were made and alternative 
procedures have been adopted. The more favoured of these appears to be affinity 
chromatography, which reduced the number of purification steps and resulted in a 
more homogenous enzyme preparation with a yield of -80% (Sharkis and Swenson, 
1989)
21
Purification has also permitted isolation of isoenzymes of DT-diaphorase with varying 
substrate specificities. A number of different forms of rat liver DT-diaphorase have 
been detected (Raftell and Bloomberg, 1980; Hojeberg et al,  1981). Segura-Aguilar 
and Lind (1987) showed the presence of three different forms using chromatofocusing 
techniques. It has been reported that two different isoforms, a hydrophobic and a 
hydrophilic type, exist in mouse liver (Prochaska and Talalay, 1986).
In humans, genetic evidence indicates the existence of four gene loci encoding 
diaphorases (oxidoreductases) denoted DIA1-DIA4. DIA4 corresponds to the gene 
encoding DT-diaphorase (NQOl) and is located on chromosome 16 (Jaiswal et al,
1988). A second human diaphorase, designated NQ02, located on chromosome 6 
has recently been identified (Jaiswal et al , 1990) and has both DNA and protein 
sequence homology with DT-diaphorase. The substrate specificities of DT- 
diaphorase and NQ02 protein differ with the NQ02 protein being 50-100 fold less 
active at reducing DCPIP and menadione. Induction also differs between the two 
isoforms*
1.3.3 Expression and Induction
DT-diaphorase is expressed in most animal tissues (Edwards et al , 1980) but its 
distribution varies widely. In animals the tissue which expresses the highest levels of 
DT-diaphorase is the liver although it is also present in the heart, kidney, brain, small 
intestine, skeletal muscle and mammary glands. High levels of DT-diaphorase have 
been found in preneoplastic liver nodules of rats treated with chemical carcinogens 
(Schor et al,  1978). In humans, high levels of DT-diaphorase are present in stomach 
and kidney (Schlager and Powis, 1990). Interestingly, increased DT-diaphorase 
expression has been reported in tumour tissue such as human colon carcinoma (Schor 
and Cornelisse, 1983), non-small cell lung carcinoma (Malkinson et al,  1992) and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Cresteil and Jaiswal, 1991) compared with normal tissue of 
the same origin (see also Schlager and Powis, 1990). There are however some 
exceptions. Lower DT-diaphorase activity has been reported in stomach and kidney 
tumours compared to normal tissues (Schlager and Powis, 1990). An increase in DT- 
diaphorase mRNA expression has also been observed in normal liver surrounding the 
tumours of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared with that of normal 
individuals (Cresteil and Jaiswal, 1991).
Smoking and alcohol have been reported to affect DT-diaphorase levels (Shlager and 
Powis, 1990; Gasdaska et al,  1993). Patients smoking at the time of examination had
22
similar DT-diaphorase expression in tumour tissue to normal tissue whereas non- 
smokers and past smokers had elevated levels in tumour tissue. Alcohol induced an 
increase in lung tumour DT-diaphorase but had no effect on normal lung tissue.
At the subcellular level DT-diaphorase is mainly located in the cytosol (>90%) 
although it is also present in mitochondria and microsomes (Emster et al,  1960; 
1962). It is believed to be located in the matrix or inner surface of the inner 
membrane of mitochondria (Conover and Emster, 1962) and to exist as a glycoprotein 
form on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum.
Induction of DT-diaphorase was first reported in the 1960's by Huggins and co- 
workers (Huggins et al,  1965). These authors observed increased levels of DT- 
diaphorase in the liver and other tissues of rats and mice treated with polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons and azo dyes. In addition these animals developed resistance 
to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of the inducers. Since these initial descriptions 
induction has been widely studied and many compounds have been identified as 
inducers of DT-diaphorase both in vitro  and in vivo.  These include the polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons such as (3-napthoflavone (Kumaki et al,  1977), 3- 
methylcholanthrene (e.g. Lind and Emster, 1974) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p- 
dioxin (TCDD) (Kumaki et al,  1977), azo dyes (Huggins and Pataki, 1978), phenolic 
antioxidants such as 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxanisole (BHA) (Benson et al,  1980) 
amongst many others. (For a comprehensive review see Talalay and Prochaska,
1987). Induction has also been reported in vitro  by a wide variety of compounds e.g. 
daunorubicin (Galaris and Rydstrom, 1983), tert-butyl hydroquinone, various 
substituted 1,2- and 1,4-diphenols and aromatic diamines (Prochaska et al,  1985).
The enhanced expression of DT-diaphorase in tumour tissue, induction of DT- 
diaphorase by carcinogens and subsequent protection against some cytotoxic effects 
of these compounds led to the belief that DT-diaphorase may play a role in cellular 
defence against environmental and dietary carcinogens. It can also act as a selective 
target for chemotherapy (Riley and Workman, 1992b)
The increased levels of DT-diaphorase may be related to enhanced synthesis of new 
protein (Hojeberg et al,  1981). Evidence indicates that this may result from increased 
transcription of the gene (Prochaska and Talalay, 1988) Hypomethylation status has 
also been correlated with this enhanced expression (Bayney and Pickett, 1987).
23
Inducers are of two main classes, those which induce only phase II enzymes and those 
which induce phase I and phase II. Prochaska and Talalay (1988) proposed a model 
to explain this phenomenon. Monofunctional inducers include compounds such as 
2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-anisole (BHA) and selectively induce only phase II 
enzymes (e.g. glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and DT-diaphorase). It is believed that 
induction by these agents does not involve the Ah (aryl hydrocarbon) receptor but acts 
via an electrophilic signal. In contrast, bifunctional inducers e.g. 2,3,7,8- 
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induce both phase I and phase II enzymes. 
Depending on the particular compound they are thought either to bind to the Ah 
receptor directly or alternatively to be metabolised to electrophilic species by phase I 
enzymes which can then subsequently act via a similar mechanism to the 
monofunctional inducers.
The molecular mechanisms involved in induction of DT-diaphorase are more 
thoroughly discussed in the next section (1.3.4),
1.3.4 Gene and Protein Sequence
Rat DT-diaphorase cDNA was cloned and fully sequenced by Robertson and co­
workers in 1986 (Robertson et al , 1986). The cDNA is 1,501 base pairs long with an 
open reading frame extending from bp 75-899 which encodes a 274 residue protein of 
molecular weight 30,946 D (Robertson et al , 1986). In 1988 cDNA of human 
cytosolic DT-diaphorase was cloned, sequenced and the protein composition 
elucidated (Jaiswal et al,  1988). The human cDNA is 2448 bp long encoding a 
protein of 274 residues with molecular weight of 30,880 D. Comparisons of the rat 
and human DT-diaphorase showed an 83% and 85% homology of cDNA and protein 
respectively (Jaiswal etal,  1988).
Subsequently the genomic DNA for both the human (Jaiswal, 1991) and rat (Bayney 
et al,  1989) DT-diaphorase (NQOl) were also cloned and sequenced. The human 
gene is approximately 20 kb long. Both genes consist of six exons and five introns 
with exons 2-5 being highly conserved between the two species (Jaiswal, 1991). The 
sixth exon is 1833 base pairs in length in the human gene and contains four potential 
polyadenylation signal sequences (AATAAA) and a single copy of the Alu repetitive 
sequence. In contrast the sixth exon of the rat gene is 907 bp long contains only one 
polyadenylation sequence and no Alu repetitive sequences. This region would 
account for the presence of three distinct mRNA species for DT-diaphorase observed 
in the Hep-G2 (human hepatoblastoma) cell line.
24
Site directed mutagenesis studies have permitted further characterisation of the DT- 
diaphorase gene. The residues Gly 150, Ser 151 and Tyr 155 which occur within the 
single glycine rich region (residues 145 - 162) of rat liver DT-diaphorase and are 
conserved in the human protein have been implicated in the binding of the cofactors 
NADH and NADPH (Ma et al,  1992b). Residues bearing hydroxyl groups within this 
glycine rich region have also been suggested to stabilise cofactor binding by hydrogen 
bonding with the pyrophosphate group of the nucleotide (Ma et al,  1992b). Within 
the same study Ma and co-workers also identified the Tyr 128 residue as an important 
factor in dicoumarol binding. Further confirmation of this involvement came from 
photoaffinity probe analysis where Thr 127 and Tyr 128 residues were modified by a 
photoaffinity analogue of 4-hydroxycoumarin (Myszka and Swenson, 1991). Due to 
the competitive inhibition of dicoumarol with the cofactors NADH and NADPH 
suggestions were also made that these residues may define part of the nucleotide 
binding site (Myszka and Swenson, 1991). Other sites which have been characterised 
by site directed mutagenesis studies include Lys 76 which appears to be involved in 
NADPH binding (Ma et al,  1992a), Cys 179 which maintains stability of the enzyme 
(Ma et al,  1992a) and Arg 177 which may be important for protein conformation and 
FAD binding (Chen et al,  1992).
Gene sequencing and mutagenesis studies have also led to further elucidation of the 
molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression and induction of the 
DT-diaphorase gene.
Within a 1850 base pair 5' flanking region of the human DT-diaphorase gene are a 
number of elements important in its transcriptional regulation (Jaiswal, 1991). A 
TATA box has been located running from base pairs -37 to -32 upstream from the 
CAP site. This is highly conserved between the rat and human and is suggested to 
play a role in initiation of transcription. A CCA AT sequence exists at nucleotide -649 
in the human gene (Jaiswal, 1991) and -129 in the rat (Bayney et al,  1989). This has 
been identified in many eukaryotic promoters and functions to increase the rate of 
transcription. Also detected are two regions known to be important in induction of 
transcription, the XRE or xenobiotic response element and the ARE or antioxidant 
response element. The XRE with a sequence of GCGTG and was present at -740 in 
the human gene (Jaiswal, 1991) and -393 in the rat gene (Favreau and Pickett, 1991). 
The involvement of the XRE in induction by chemicals has been extensively studied 
for the cytochrome P450 1A1 gene (Whitlock, 1987). A sequence known as the Ah 
locus codes for a 280 kD protein product known as the Ah receptor. This is thought
25
to bind to chemical inducers and then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the 
XRE and initiates transcriptional activation of the gene. This then leads to an increase 
in the corresponding mRNA and ultimately an increase in the levels of protein. It has 
been suggested that a similar mechanism may occur in the case of the DT-diaphorase 
gene. The observations that the DT-diaphorase gene is not induced in cell lines 
deficient in the cytochrome P450 1A1 gene and that induction of DT-diaphorase 
appears to have a delayed onset over that of other enzymes has led to the theory that 
some inducers may be metabolised by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 1A1 and 
that the metabolites may actually act as the inducers of DT-diaphorase. Both the 
human and rat genes possess an ARE located between -467 and -447 for the human 
gene (Jaiswal, 1991) and -434 to -404 for the rat gene (Favreau and Pickett, 1991). 
Within this region 6 base pairs have been identified as being essential for induction, 
GTGAC NNNGC (where N = any nucleotide), with TGAC being required for basal 
expression (Rushmore et al,  1991). An API binding site (TGACTC) has also been 
identified contained within the ARE sequence of the human gene (Jaiswal, 1991); this 
has 5 of the 7 base pairs conserved in the rat API site (Favreau and Pickett, 1991) and 
is important for both basal expression and induction of the gene by some compounds. 
API proteins form homo or heterodimers with other proteins such as Jun B, Jun D and 
Fos, and create a transcription factor. This is then thought to bind to the API site 
within the ARE, regulating expression of the gene.
1.3.5 Mechanisms of Reaction
DT-diaphorase is commonly considered to react by a binary complex or 'ping-pong' 
mechanism with its electron donor and electron acceptor. These two substrates are 
competitive inhibitors with respect to each other which suggests some relationship 
between the cofactor and substrate binding sites within the enzyme. It has been 
suggested that DT-diaphorase is an obligate two-electron transferring enzyme 
(Iyanagi and Yamazaki, 1970).
As discussed previously, both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactors NADH 
and NADPH are able to act as electron donors (Emster et al,  1962). The enzyme also 
has a wide substrate specificity being reported to metabolise a wide variety of 
quinones as well as azo-dyes, (Huang et al,  1979a and b), nitro compounds (e.g. 
Sugimura et al,  1966) and chromium compounds (De Flora et al,  1985). DCPIP, 
menadione and some other benzo and napthoquinones were the most active substrates 
(for summary see Emster et al,  1962).
26
A number of compounds also act as inhibitors of DT-diaphorase, the most potent of 
which is dicoumarol (Emster et al,  1962). Others include coumarin derivatives e.g. 
warfarin, indandione derivatives (Lind and Hojeberg, 1981; Hollander and Emster 
1975), Dicoumarol is believed to inhibit the enzyme by competing for the NAD(P)H 
cofactor binding site (Emster et al,  1962).
1.4 DT-diaphorase in Cancer Chemotherapy
The involvement of DT-diaphorase in cancer chemotherapy has recently been the 
subject of a number of publications and has been comprehensively reviewed by Riley 
and Workman (1992b).
CB 1954
The high selectivity of CB 1954 for the rat Walker tumour with lack of effect in 
human tumours prompted detailed research into the mechanism of activation of the 
compound. The enzyme responsible for activation of CB 1954 in the rat Walker cells 
was found to be DT-diaphorase (Knox et al,  1988a and b), and its involvement was 
clarified by inhibitor studies (Roberts et al,  1989). DT-diaphorase reduced CB 1954 
by 4-electron reduction to generate 5-(aziridin-l-yl)-4-hydroxylam ino-2- 
nitrobenzamide (Knox et al,  1988b) which then reacted with acetyl CoA or thioesters 
to form 4-(N-acetoxy)-5-(aziridin-l-yl)-2-nitrobenzamide (Knox et al,  1991). The 
latter compound is a difunctional alkylating species and was shown to form 
interstrand cross-links in Walker cell DNA. Interstrand cross-links are believed to be 
intrinsically more cytotoxic than single stranded di-adducts or monofunctional 
adducts (Roberts and Friedlos, 1987). The sensitivity of rat Walker cells to CB 1954, 
in addition to being a function of activation, may also be enhanced by an inherent 
sensitivity to these adducts (Knox et al,  1991). DNA damage studies have shown that 
the reaction predominantly occurs with the C 8 position of deoxyguanosine and 
molecular modelling suggests that the second arm of the cross-link will be at the 06 
of deoxyguanosine (Knox et al,  1993).
The lower sensitivity of human tumours to CB 1954 is thought to result from reduced 
activation of the compound. DT-diaphorase has been reported to exist in high levels 
in human tumours and is similar in protein structure to that present in rodents. It 
appears however, that the human enzyme is less efficient at catalysing metabolism of 
CB 1954 than is the rat form of the enzyme (Boland et al,  1991).
27
Ongoing studies in Dr Knox's laboratory at the Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, 
Surrey, UK (Knox et al,  1993) are examining analogues of CB 1954 in attempt to find 
one that is more efficiently metabolised by human DT-diaphorase. CB 10-200 (5- 
(aziridin-l-yl)-2,4-dinitro-l-isobutylbenzoate), the analogue in which the 
carboxamide has been substituted by an isobutylcarboxylate moiety, was reduced 40 
times more rapidly by the human enzyme than CB 1954 (Lambert et al , 1992). It also 
retained selectivity for cells expressing DT-diaphorase.
SR 4233
Initial indications of the involvement of DT-diaphorase in metabolism of SR 4233 
came from Walton and Workman (1990). Sonicates of rat Walker tumour cells 
reduced SR 4233 under aerobic conditions to generate the two and four-electron 
reduced products SR 4317 and SR 4330 respectively. Formation of these metabolites 
was largely inhibited by dicoumarol (SR 4330 by 95% and SR 4317 by 47%) 
suggesting the involvement of DT-diaphorase (Walton and Workman, 1990).
Confirmation of the ability of DT-diaphorase to metabolise SR 4233 came from 
studies carried out by Riley and Workman (1992a) using a highly purified preparation 
of the rat Walker enzyme. Reduction conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and 
was not affected by change in pH over the range 5.8 - 8.0. The rate of SR 4233 
metabolism was far lower than that observed for menadione. Under aerobic 
conditions SR 4330 was the major product following prolonged incubation although 
SR 4317 was also detected at comparable levels for 10-15 minutes. Formation of SRby
4330 was almost completely inhibited. SR 4330 was also found to act as a substrate 
for DT-diaphorase whereas SR 4317 could not. It is possible that a further metabolite 
may be the oxygen-sensitive six-electron reduced compound detected during 
electrochemical and chemical reduction. Cahill and co-workers (1993) published 
similar findings. In addition these latter investigators examined anaerobic reduction 
of SR 4233 by purified Walker DT-diaphorase. Metabolism of the drug in the 
absence of air was found to be approximately three fold higher than in air with 
differences in metabolites also being observed. SR 4317 was the major product of 
reduction but approximately 50% of metabolites formed were unidentified.
In the whole cell system SR 4317 was also a major metabolite formed within Walker 
cells (Cahill et al , 1993). Generation of this metabolite was not greatly affected by 
dicoumarol although it led to partial reduction of DNA damage.
28
Dicoumarol inhibition studies with sonicates of a human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT 
1080) also indicated that DT-diaphorase may play a role in metabolism of SR 4233 
(Wang etal,  1993).
Thus it appears that SR 4233 is able to undergo metabolism catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions although the metabolites 
formed may differ depending on oxygen status. As SR 4317 and SR 4330 are the 
predominant products detected it has been suggested that DT-diaphorase may play a 
protective role against SR 4233 toxicity by bypassing the putative damaging radical 
intermediate (Riley and Workman, 1992a; Walton et al,  1992c; Cahill et al,  1993). 
The role played by DT-diaphorase in the toxicity of SR 4233, as with other 
bioreductive agents will depend on the levels and affinities of other enzymes within 
the cell as well as the nature of the metabolites formed. In practice, results from cell 
studies suggest that DT-diaphorase may not be important in the metabolism and 
cytotoxicity of SR 4233 in intact cells (Plumb et al,  1994a and b).
Mitomycin C
Despite numerous studies examining mitomycin C activation the involvement of DT- 
diaphorase has been highly controversial (Workman and Walton, 1989). Initial 
indications of a role for DT-diaphorase in bioreductive activation of mitomycin C 
came from cytotoxicity experiments in vitro  on a range of tumour cell lines, including 
initially the effects of dicoumarol on the response of EMT 6 cells (Sartorelli, 1988). A 
murine lymphoblast cell line, L5178Y made resistant to benzoquinone had 20 fold 
greater DT-diaphorase expression than the parental line and showed an increased 
sensitivity to mitomycin C (Begleiter et al,  1992). The levels of NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase, also shown to metabolise mitomycin C, were similar in 
both the parental and resistant lines indicating that DT-diaphorase may be an 
important factor in activation of the compound. In support of this theory, mitomycin 
C was also found to be more potent towards other cell lines containing high levels of 
DT-diaphorase compared with their low / non-expressing counterparts. These include 
the 3437T and GM38 human fibroblast cells derived from patients from a cancer 
prone family and healthy donor respectively (Marshall et al,  1989, 1991b) and pairs 
of repair-proficient and deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (Dulhanty and 
Whitmore, 1989, 1991). In addition, the DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol reduced 
the sensitivity of the high DT-diaphorase expressing lymphoblasts (Begleiter et al,  
1988, 1992) and fibroblasts (Marshall et al,  1989, 1991a and b) to mitomycin C as
29
well as decreasing interstrand cross-link formation (Begleiter et al,  1988, 1992). 
Interestingly studies with EMT 6 mouse mammary tumour cells showed some 
inhibition of mitomycin C toxicity under aerobic conditions in the presence of 
dicoumarol but not under hypoxia (Keyes et al,  1985).
The evidence obtained in favour of mitomycin C activation by DT-diaphorase was 
therefore largely indirect and based heavily on inhibitor studies using dicoumarol. 
Dicoumarol has been shown to exert pleiotropic effects and therefore caution should 
be taken when interpreting data obtained using this inhibitor (Workman and Walton,
1989). To clarify the involvement of DT-diaphorase in the metabolism of mitomycin 
C purified enzyme was employed. Schlager and Powis (1988) were unable to detect 
reduction of mitomycin C catalysed by DT-diaphorase purified from either human 
kidney or rat liver. Mitomycin C also acted as a poor substrate for DT-diaphorase 
present in sonicates of rat Walker tumour cells which contain high levels of the 
enzyme (Walton et al,  1992b). Another cell line expressing high levels of DT- 
diaphorase, the HT29 human colon carcinoma line, was more sensitive to mitomycin 
C than the BE colon carcinoma line which does not express a functional form of the 
enzyme (Siegel et al,  1990b). However, when DT-diaphorase purified from the HT29 
cells was used to examine reduction of mitomycin C at neutral pH no metabolism was 
detected. Kennedy and co-workers (1985) had previously reported an increased 
cytotoxicity of mitomycin C at low pH. pH was also subsequently found to influence 
the metabolism of mitomycin C catalysed by purified DT-diaphorase derived from rat 
liver and human HT29 cells with reduction being detected as pH was decreased to 5.8 
(Siegel et al,  1990b). They suggested that the reason for the enhanced metabolism at 
lower pH values was the formation of the quinone methide metabolite. At high pH 
(above 7.4) this was proposed to alkylate the enzyme thus inactivating it whereas at 
lower pH values protonation may occur, converting the quinone methide to 2,7- 
diaminomitosene which may be released from the DT-diaphorase permitting 
metabolism to proceed.
The role of DT-diaphorase in the cellular cytotoxicity of mitomycin C remains 
controversial. Whereas Robertson et al,  (1994) found no correlation between 
mitomycin C sensitivity and DT-diaphorase activity in a large panel of cell lines, 
Fitzsimmons et al,  (1994) did find a correlation in the NCI human tumour panel.
30
AZQ
In a similar manner to mitomycin C, AZQ acted as a more potent cytotoxin in HT29 
than in BE cells. Dicoumarol inhibited this cytotoxicity as well as DNA damage in 
HT29 cells, thus suggesting that DT-diaphorase may be responsible for AZQ 
activation (Siegel et al,  1990a). Siegel and co-workers (1990) confirmed that DT- 
diaphorase present in HT29 cell cytosol as well as highly purified preparations 
derived from HT29 cells and rat liver could catalyse metabolism of AZQ.
Further evidence of AZQ activation by DT-diaphorase came from spectrophotometric 
and ESR studies performed by Fisher and Gutierrez (1991b). They found that AZQ 
was metabolised to give a semiquinone radical by the dicoumarol-inhibitable 
component of the S9 fraction of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. Similar results 
were subsequently obtained using a purified preparation of DT-diaphorase. Data from 
both groups indicated that AZQ was metabolised by DT-diaphorase to an oxygen 
sensitive hydroquinone which auto-oxidised under aerobic conditions to generate a 
semiquinone radical. DT-diaphorase was also able to catalyse AZQ reduction to a 
DNA interstrand cross-linking species at neutral pH (Lee et al,  1992).
E09
At the outset of the work carried out in this thesis few studies had examined the role 
of DT-diaphorase in metabolism of E09. Sonicates of rat UK Walker 256 mammary 
tumour cells had been found to metabolise E09 (Walton et al,  1992b). This activity 
was largely inhibitable by dicoumarol and was therefore attributed to DT-diaphorase. 
Preliminary studies using HT29 human colon carcinoma cell sonicates (Walton et al,
1991) which also contain high levels of DT-diaphorase similarly exhibited dicoumarol 
inhibitable metabolism of E09.
Subsequently a number of investigators have compared sensitivity of a range of 
tumour cell lines to E09 with their DT-diaphorase activity. In addition to data 
presented in this thesis, evidence to support the hypothesis that DT-diaphorase may 
play a role in determining the sensitivity of tumour cells in vitro  and in vivo  was 
provided by Walton and co-workers (1992a). These authors reported that E09 
exhibited more potent cytotoxicity in HT29 colon carcinoma cells which express high 
levels of DT-diaphorase compared to BE cells which, due to a mutation in the NQOl 
gene, do not express a functional form of the enzyme. In addition, data obtained in 
vivo showed that DT-diaphorase activity was 16 fold higher in the mouse
31
adenocarcinoma MAC 16 than in the mouse adenocarcinoma MAC 26 which exhibits 
greater resistance to E09. Further data which substantiate a role for DT-diaphorase in 
E09 cytotoxicity under aerobic conditions have been provided by Robertson and co- 
workers (1992, 1994), Plumb and co-workers (1994a and b) and Smitskamp and co­
workers (1994) in a large range of cell lines. In general, these studies showed a good 
correlation between levels of DT-diaphorase and E09 cytotoxicity. Collard and 
Double (1992) reported that, although cells expressing high levels of DT-diaphorase 
tended to be more sensitive to E09, there was no absolute agreement between the two 
parameters. However, this study examined only a small number of cell lines. In a 
recent survey of the extensive NCI human tumour cell line panel, Fitzsimmons et al,  
(1994) confirmed the relationship between DT-diaphorase expression and sensitivity 
to E09.
Interestingly hypoxia increased the sensitivity to E09 of cells expressing low levels of 
DT-diaphorase but had little effect on cells expressing high levels of the enzyme 
(Plumb and Workman, 1994; Robertson et al,  1994; Plumb et al,  1994b). In fact an 
inverse correlation has been suggested for the hypoxic cell cytotoxicity of E09 and 
DT-diaphorase activity (Plumb et al,  1994b).
1.5 Enzyme Directed Prodrug Therapy (EDPT)
Enzyme-directed prodrug therapy involves the design of prodrugs that are converted 
to cytotoxic compounds following enzymatic activation (Workman and Walton, 1990; 
Workman, 1994). Tumour cell selectivity is attained by targeting enzymes which 
exhibit increased expression or activity in tumour versus normal tissue. The work 
described in this thesis is part of an 'enzyme directed approach to bioreductive drug 
development' adopted by our laboratory. It is hoped that this will permit the 
optimisation of drug structure to suit the catalytic preferences of key bioreductive 
enzymes.
Further information is required for this approach to be of clinical benefit including:-
(1) Characterisation of other enzymes involved in metabolism of these 
bioreductive agents.
32
(2) 'Enzyme profiling' of tumour versus normal tissue - i.e. characterisation of the 
levels and activity of relevant activating and detoxifying enzymes as well as 
their affinities for the bioreductive agents.
(3) Definition of resistance mechanisms for particular compounds so that methods 
of circumventing resistance may be developed.
(4) Determination of tumour hypoxia and pH.
1.6 Aims of This Thesis
As part of the enzyme directed approach to bioreductive drug development outlined
above, the overall goal of the work described in this thesis was to determine the
mechanism of activation and cytotoxicity of selected bioreductive antitumour agents. 
An understanding of these features may lead to optimisation of drug structure for 
optimal antitumour activity. Studies have focused on the novel indoloquinone agent 
E 09 and related agents but have also examined the structurally similar 
aziridinylbenzoquinone compound AZQ and its analogues, as well as certain 
cyclopropamitosenes.
As discussed earlier, the enzyme DT-diaphorase shows increased expression and 
activity in some solid tumours compared with normal tissue and catalyses metabolism 
of compounds that are structurally similar to E09 and AZQ. It was therefore 
considered likely that this enzyme may be especially important in the activation of 
E 09 and AZQ. The initial aims were therefore first to determine whether DT- 
diaphorase was capable of catalysing metabolism of the bioreductive compounds 
E09, AZQ and cyclopropamitosenes. Secondly to compare the ability of the agents 
to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase with their cytotoxic potency in 
order to assess whether this was an activation or detoxification process. Thirdly, to 
examine DNA damage as a possible mechanism of cytotoxicity and to clarify the 
involvement of DT-diaphorase in activation of these compounds to DNA damaging 
species. Finally, by studying structural analogues of these compounds to highlight 
areas where drug structure could be modified for optimal metabolism and antitumour 
activity.

Chapter 2  
General Materials and Methods
This chapter covers the main materials and methods used throughout the thesis. 
Individual chapters contain methods particular to those chapters and also include 
more details of procedures described in this section.
2.1 Chemicals and Biochemicals
I am grateful for the gifts of E09 and related indoloquinone compounds from the 
EORTC New Drug Development Office (Amsterdam, Netherlands) and 
aziridinylbenzoquinone analogues of diaziquone (AZQ) from Dr John Butler 
(Paterson Institute, Manchester, UK). The purity of E09 and analogues E05A and 
E012 was determined as >99% by HPLC (Binger and Workman, 1990). Additional 
confirmation of E09 purity was provided by Dr. E. Bailey (MRC Toxicology Unit, 
Carshalton, Surrey, UK, unpublished data) using gas chromatography and mass 
spectral analysis.
Highly purified (95%) rat Walker UK 256 tumour cell DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H: 
quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2) used in initial experiments was kindly 
provided by Dr R. Knox (Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK) as well as 
rabbit anti-rat Walker tumour DT-diaphorase antiserum. For later experiments rat 
Walker DT-diaphorase was prepared as outlined in Section 2.4. Purified rat liver 
NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase was a gift from Professor R. Wolf (University 
of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK).
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, Dorset, UK) and all 
tissue culture media and sera from Gibco Ltd. (Paisley, Scotland, UK) unless 
otherwise stated in the text.
34
2.2 Cell Culture
2.2.1 HT29 and BE Cells
HT29 and BE cell lines are derived from human adenocarcinomas of the colon. The 
HT29 cells were obtained from Dr J. Fogh who originally derived the cell line (Fogh 
and Trempe, 1975). The BE cells were a gift from Dr N. W Gibson (University of 
Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA). Both of these lines, which grow 
as a monolayer, have similar morphology to their original counterparts in vivo  
(Erickson et al,  1978). The HT29 cells grow in an organised fashion whereas the BE 
cells are relatively disorganised and are interspersed with giant cells.
HT29 tumour cells differ from the BE cells in a number of aspects. Of particular 
relevance to this thesis is the fact that HT29 cells express high levels of DT- 
diaphorase (Siegel et al,  1990a) whereas BE cells do not express a functional form of 
the enzyme due to a mutation in the NQOl gene (Traver et al,  1992). In addition BE 
cells are deficient in the DNA repair enzyme 06 alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase 
and are often described as mer- (Fornace et al,  1990). HT29 cells possess this 
enzyme and are denoted mer+ (Fornace et al,  1990). Siegel and co-workers (1990a) 
compared activities of other enzymes present in sonicates of the two cell lines. They 
reported little difference in levels of NADPH : cytochrome P450 reductase, xanthine 
oxidase was not detected in either the HT29 or BE cells, and 4-5 fold lower 
expression of glutathione and glutathione-S transferase was observed in BE cells 
compared to HT29.
BE and HT29 cell lines were cultured under identical conditions. Stock cultures of 
cells were grown in monolayer, seeded at a density of 1  x 10 5 cells / 75 cm 2 plastic 
tissue culture flask (Falcon Plastics, Crawley, Sussex, UK). They were maintained in 
Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Seralab, 
Crawley Down, Sussex, UK), 1  mM glutamine and the antibiotics penicillin and 
streptomycin (100 units / ml and 100 |ig / ml respectively). Cells were incubated at 
37°C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 8% C 0 2 and were subcultured 
weekly by trypsinisation. This involved removal of medium and washing twice in a 
mixture of trypsin (0.1%) and EDTA (0.04%) in PBS before incubation at 37°C for 
15 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in a small volume of medium, 
disaggregated using a pipette, and finally counted using a haemocytometer before 
dilution to the appropriate concentration. Medium was replaced twice weekly 
between subculturing.
35
2.2.2 Walker Cells
The Walker tumour from which the cell line was ultimately derived was initially 
identified in 1928 by Dr G. Walker at the John Hopkins University Medical School. 
It was observed as a mammary adenocarcinoma present in a pregnant albino rat 
although subsequently the adenomatous features have disappeared. The tumour has 
been maintained at the Institute of Cancer Research, London since 1944 and has been 
used as a screen for antitumour agents (Knox et al,  1991). It was noted that the 
tumour was particularly sensitive to difunctional alkylating agents in 1966 (Rosenoer 
et al,  1966; Everett, 1966). Sensitivity was retained in the rat Walker UK 256 cell 
line established from this tumour (Knox et al,  1991). A subline resistant to 
chlorambucil was developed in Professor K. Harrap's laboratory (Institute of Cancer 
Research, London, UK) and this was subsequently found to be cross-resistant to a 
number of other difunctional alkylating agents (Knox et al,  1991). It is however, no 
longer kept under selective pressure (Knox et al,  1991), This subline was designated 
Walker Resistant (WR) while the parent cell line was denoted Walker Sensitive (WS).
The Walker tumour cell line was, like the HT29 cells, of particular interest for this 
research due to its expression of the enzyme DT-diaphorase (Boland et al,  1991) 
which confers its high sensitivity to CB 1954 (Knox et al,  1988b). Both Walker 
Sensitive and Resistant lines were a gift from Dr R. Knox.
The two strains of the Walker cells, WR and WS were cultured in an identical 
manner. Cells were grown as a suspension culture at a density of 1  x 10 5 cells / ml in 
75 cm 2 plastic tissue culture flasks and were subcultured 3 times weekly. They were 
maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse 
serum, 1  mM glutamine and antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were 
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 8% C 0 2.
All cell stocks were checked for mycoplasma on a frequent basis and were found to 
be free from infection.
2.3 Preparation of Cell Sonicates
Cell sonicates of both the HT29 and Walker cells were prepared for use in enzyme 
assays. HT29 cells, harvested at confluence by trypsinisation, and Walker cells taken 
on reaching a density of approximately 1 x 107 cells / ml were pooled and washed
36
three times in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) by alternate centrifugation (5 
minutes at 150 g using a Beckman TJ 6 centrifuge) and resuspension. Aprotonin 
(final concentration 1%) was added to the resultant cell suspension to prevent 
breaking down of reductive enzymes by proteases. Cells were then disrupted by 
sonication (MSE Soniprep 150 sonicator, MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, 
Sussex, UK) on ice using 3 x 10 second exposures at maximum power before 
centrifugation at 15000 g which served to remove cell debris and high molecular 
weight components. The supernatant was taken and filtersterilised using a Millipore 
filter (0.2 pm pore size; Millipore UK Ltd., Watford, Herts, UK). Finally sonicates 
were aliquotted and frozen at -70°C permitting utilisation without repetitive freeze- 
thawing procedures which may damage the enzyme.
2.4 Protein Purification
2.4.1 Introduction
A highly purified preparation of DT-diaphorase was derived from rat Walker UK 256 
tumour cells. The method was identical to that described by Knox and co-workers 
(1988). Walker cells were grown as a bulk preparation and sonicated before 
purification. This involved two cycles of gel filtration chromatography which 
separated out the proteins on the basis of molecular size. Active fractions were then 
further separated on the basis of ionic charge by two cycles of anion exchange 
chromatography. Fractions were assayed for DT-diaphorase activity following each 
purification stage and were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
Western blot analysis as described in Section 2.5 in order to confirm the identity and 
purity of the protein.
2.4.2 Preparation of Walker Cell Sonicate
Cells were grown in suspension culture as previously described (Section 2.2.2) in a 
175 cm 2 flask for about one week until cells reached a density of approximately 1.5 x 
106 cells / ml. These were used as to inoculate a 20 1  vessel containing 18 1  of 
Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, horse serum (10%) L'-glutamine (1 mM) and 
antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. This was connected to a 5% CO 2 supply and 
maintained as a stirred suspension culture at 37°C until cells had reached an optimum 
density (2 x 10 6 cells / ml) for harvesting (approximately 7 days).
37
Cells were then concentrated by centrifugation initially using a Beckman J 68 
centrifuge (150 g for 10 minutes) and on reaching a volume of less than 1  1  cells were 
further concentrated using a Beckman TJ -6 centrifuge (7 minutes at 150 g). Residual 
medium was removed by decantation, the resulting cell pellet resuspended in PBS 
(2.5 ml of cells :  1  ml of PBS) and aprotonin was added to give a final concentration 
of 1% before disruption by sonication. Three 10 second pulses were given at 
maximum intensity using a sonicator (MSE Soniprep 150) with medium sized head, 
cooling the sample on ice between each stage. The resultant sonicate was transferred 
to Beckman tubes on ice for centrifugation at 4°C, 15000 g for 30 minutes (Beckman 
L8-55 ultracentrifuge) to remove high molecular weight matter. Finally the 
supernatant was collected and filtered through Millipore sterile filters to clear 
particulate matter before gel filtration chromatography.
2.4.3 Gel Filtration Chromatography
Aliquots of the filter sterilised Walker cell sonicate were injected on to a TSK G3000 
SWG (21.5 x 600 mm) gel filtration column (Anagel) fitted with a 2 ml injection 
loop. The sample was then eluted isocratically with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer 
pH 7 at a flow rate of 4 ml / minute. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and kept on ice 
before analysing for DT-diaphorase activity. This was carried out using the 
cytochrome c reduction assay outlined in Section 2.7 of this thesis employing a set 
concentration of menadione (10 pM). In addition samples were examined for their 
ability to catalyse metabolism of E09 (10 pM). In this case 4 ml fractions were 
collected. Active fractions (numbers 5-20 (Fig 2.2)) were yellow in colour and 
eluted between 23 and 29 minutes with the peak at -25 minutes as confirmed by 
absorbance at 280 nm using a UV detector (Fig 2.1). An increase in absorbance at 
280 nm was also observed coincident with sample elution at around 37 minutes and 
minor peaks at 52-56 and 63 minutes. Only the fractions eluting at 37 minutes did 
however show activity with menadione and E09 (Fig 2.2). Fractions containing the 
peak of activity were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Centriprep 10 until a 
final volume of approximately 5 ml remained. This was then again injected on to the 
gel filtration column for a second elution step carried out as described previously. 
Fractions were collected, assessed for DT-diaphorase activity and active fractions 
pooled and concentrated. In all cases activity of protein was found to be inhibited by 
dicoumarol and no reduction was seen in the absence of either menadione or E09. 
Furthermore when analysing fractions NADH was found to function with equal 
efficiency to NADPH as a cofactor. This is a characteristic of DT-diaphorase and 
further confirms the identity of the enzyme purified.

2.4.4 Anion Exchange Chromatography
The active, concentrated fractions obtained from gel filtration were injected on to a 
TSK DEAE-5PW 115 x 10 nm anion exchange column with a 2 ml loop. Samples 
were eluted at 1  ml / minute using a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M sodium chloride in 10 
mM NaH 2P C >4, pH 7.0 over 30 minutes and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. These 
were assessed for DT-diaphorase activity as described in Section 2.7. Active 
fractions (numbers 15-33, Fig. 2.4) eluted between 6 and 10 minutes with a peak of 
activity at 7.68 minutes as detected by spectral changes at 280 nm (Fig. 2.3). These 
fractions were collected, concentrated and desalted by adding 10 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at an equivalent volume to the concentrate. This sample was 
then reinjected on to the column and the active fractions were again collected. An 
approximate sample concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (450 nm) 
and was found to contain 1  mg / ml of protein. This was diluted to give 0.5 mg / ml 
with ice cold PBS before filterstenlisation using a Millipore filter (0.2 pm pore size) 
The purified DT-diaphorase was then aliquotted to avoid necessity for freeze / 
thawing and was stored at -70° C.
The identity of the purified enzyme obtained was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed 
by Coomassie blue staining and western blotting. DT-diaphorase was present as a 
single band which corresponded to a protein of approximately 33 kD molecular 
weight (Fig. 2.5 and 2.6) and reacted with rabbit anti-rat DT-diaphorase antiserum 
(Fig. 2.6). Samples of eluate taken following gel filtration and anion exchange 
chromatography steps showed two extra bands in addition to that for DT-diaphorase 
in the western immunoblot (Fig 2.6). These were believed to represent breakdown 
products of the enzyme.
2.5 Electrophoretic Analysis of Proteins
2.5.1 SDS Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out by the method 
described by Laemmli (1970) using a Bio-Rad Protean 2 kit (Bio-Rad, Hemel 
Hempsted, Herts. UK).

Glass plates (12 cm x 16 cm) and spacers were cleaned with alcohol, assembled in 
casting stands and a 12% polyacrylamide separating gel was poured to a level of 16 
cm. This contained 14.8 ml (12% (w/v)) of polyacrylamide (30% w/v acrylamide and 
1.57% bisacrylamide, Serum Biotech. Ltd., Kidderminster, UK); 9.25 ml separating 
buffer (Tris [1.5 M], SDS [0.5%], pH 8); 11 ml distilled deionised water. These 
constituents were thoroughly mixed before addition of freshly prepared ammonium 
persulphate (APS; Bio-Rad) 2 ml (1% (w/v)) and N,N,Nl,Nl-tetramethylethylene 
diamine (TEMED [20 pi]). The gel was overlayed with distilled water and left to set 
for 30 minutes. Following polymerization of the gel, water was poured off, a comb 
(previously cleaned in alcohol) was inserted and the stacking gel poured. The latter 
was prepared in an identical manner to the separating gel but consisted of 1.5 ml of 
30% acrylamide and bisacrylamide (4.5%), 2.5 ml stacking gel buffer (Tris [0.5 M], 
SDS [0.5%], pH 6.6), 5.7 ml distilled deionised water, 0.3 ml APS (1%), 10 p,l 
TEMED. The glass plates containing the gel were then detached from the casting 
stand and clipped in to the upper reservoir of the Bio-Rad kit. The latter had been 
previously moistened to enhance the seal. The assembled plates and upper reservoir 
were lowered in to the lower reservoir and approximately 1.5 1  of electrode buffer 
(Tris, [0.52 M], glycine [0.53 M], SDS [35 mM], pH 8.3 diluted 1/10 in distilled 
deionised water) were added. The comb was then gently removed from the glass 
plates and electrode buffer added to cover the electrodes. Following protein 
determination the samples were diluted to the required concentration, mixed with an 
equal volume of boiling mix (SDS [2%], (3-mercaptoethanol [5%], glycerol [10%], 
bromophenol blue [0.005%], stacking gel buffer [10%]) and were boiled for 5 
minutes. A 10 jxl aliquot of these samples was then loaded on to the gel and 
electrophoresis was carried out for 1.5 hours at 50 mA to allow migration of the 
protein through the stacking gel before running overnight at 6 mA.
2.5.2 Coomassie Blue Staining
Total protein content was visualised by staining the gel in Coomassie blue (75 ml / 1  
glacial acetic acid; 45.5 ml / 1  methanol; 2.5 g / 1  Coomassie blue in distilled 
deionised water) for a period of 2-3 hours and destaining (70 ml /1 glacial acetic acid; 
50 ml /1 methanol in distilled deionised water) until ready to photograph.

2.5.3 Western Immunoblotting
Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were analysed for the presence of DT-diaphorase 
by western blotting. The method was essentially that described by Towbin and co­
workers (1979) with modification by Adams and co-workers (1985). The gel was 
first transferred on to an Immobilon, polyvinylidene difluoride microporous 
membrane (Millipore, UK Ltd.) by a semi dry method. Six sheets of Whatman filter 
paper 16 cm x 16 cm were soaked in transfer buffer (Tris [48 mM]; glycine [39 mM]; 
SDS [0.037% w/v] in distilled deionised water) and were placed centrally in the 
Milliblot Graphite Electroblotter 1  apparatus (Millipore). A polyvinylidene difluoride 
microporous membrane (16 cm x 16 cm) which had previously been soaked in 
methanol, rinsed in water and then soaked in transfer buffer was then added. The 
stacking gel was removed from the separating gel and the latter was gently lowered 
on top of this stack before finally covering with a further 6 sheets of filter paper 
prepared as described above. Where two gels were transferred together a layer of 
dialysis tubing was placed between the two gels. A pipette was rolled over the top in 
order to ensure that the gel was completely flat against the membrane. The transfer 
process was then carried out at 200 mA for 45 minutes.
Following transfer of the proteins on to the membrane the latter was removed, rinsed 
in TBST (NaCl [165 mM]; Tris base [49.5 mM], pH 7.9; Tween 20 [0.05%]) and left 
to block overnight in 5% skimmed milk (Marvel™) in TBST. The membrane was 
then rinsed for 2 x 10 minutes before incubation with rabbit anti-rat Walker DT- 
diaphorase antiserum (1/500 dilution) in 10% Marvel™ for 1  hour. The antiserum 
had been reported to be specific for DT-diaphorase and cross-reactive with the human 
form of the enzyme (Boland^ 1991) The membrane was then rinsed again in TBST (4 
x 15 minutes) before adding the secondary antibody, protein A horseradish 
peroxidase linked (1/5000 dilution; Amersham Int. Pic., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK) 
in 10% Marvel™ in TBST for 15 minutes. Finally the latter was removed by washing 
for 30 minutes in TBST changing the buffer frequently during this period. The bands 
were visualised by staining with ECL (Amersham Int. Pic.) for one minute followed 
by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. This involved removal of excess buffer 
by gently blotting the membrane between filter paper, staining in ECL (mixed in 
equal proportions of reagent 1 and 2 as provided in the kit) for 1 minute, blotting off 
excess stain and wrapping in Saran Wrap™ before exposure to Polariod film.

2.6 Protein Determination
The protein concentration of various enzyme samples was determined where 
necessary using one of two commercial kits produced by Pierce or Bio-Rad.
The Bio-Rad method is to some extent based on the Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) 
and utilises the fact that a solution of acidic Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 changes 
peak absorbance from 465 nm to 595 nm when it binds to proteins. The dye reagent 
supplied contains dye, phosphoric acid and methanol.
A standard curve was prepared using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) according to the kit instructions. Samples were mixed with the dye reagent at 
a ratio of 1  part sample to 5 parts reaction mixture. Absorbance was monitored 
spectrophotometrically using a Uvicon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron, Zurich, 
Switzerland) at a wavelength of 595 nm at a time point between 5 -6 0  minutes after 
initiating the reaction.
Protein samples of unknown concentration were assayed in a similar manner and their 
concentration interpolated from the standard curve.
The Pierce (BCA) assay kit depends on the detection of Cu1 +  which is formed from 
Cu2+ on its reaction with protein under alkaline conditions and forms a complex with 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) to result in a change in absorbance at 562 nm. The 
absorbance change is monitored spectrophotometrically and protein content of 
samples determined from comparison with a standard curve of BSA. Briefly, 0.1 ml 
of protein sample were added to a cuvette and mixed with 2.0 ml of reagent. This 
was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes before cooling to room temperature and reading 
the absorbance.
2.7 Cytochrome c Reduction Assay
D T -diaphorase reduction of quinone com pounds was m onitored 
spectrophotometrically using a method similar to that described by Emster (1962). 
The reaction was followed by detecting a decrease in absorbance of cytochrome c at 
550 nm using a Uvicon 860 spectrophotometer. Cytochrome c acts as a signal 
molecule accepting electrons from the reduced quinone substrate. Reaction 
constituents include cytochrome c (77 |iM), BSA (0.14%), purified rat Walker DT-
42
diaphorase, quinone dissolved in a mixture of DMSO (final concentration of 1% or 
2%) and Tris buffer with BSA (0.14%) in a final volume of 1ml of Tris-Cl buffer pH 
7.5. The reaction was started by addition of the electron donor NADH (2 mM) and 
was monitored at 37°C for 1-2 minutes. Menadione, the conventional substrate for 
DT-diaphorase, was included as a standard and as a positive control. Reactions were 
repeated in the presence and absence of 100 pM dicoumarol, the relatively selective 
and potent inhibitor of DT-diaphorase. The activity attributed to this enzyme was 
calculated as that fraction which was inhibited by dicoumarol. Appropriate controls 
were carried out where each individual reaction component was omitted and reaction 
conditions were confirmed to be optimum. Within an individual experiment assays 
were repeated at least twice.
The amount of DMSO used as a solvent for compounds was also found to affect DT- 
diaphorase activity. A 12-13 % decrease in menadione metabolising activity was 
observed when increasing DMSO concentration from 1  to 2%. For this reason care 
was taken to prepare drug dilutions in vehicle to maintain the concentration of DMSO 
constant. Variation between repeat assays carried out within a day was small, in 
general being less than 5%.
2.7.1 Calculation of Kinetic Constants
Activity was calculated in nmoles of cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg protein 
using the extinction coefficient of 21.1 mM cm _ 1 for cytochrome c. In some cases 
activity has been expressed in pmoles of cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg, due to 
the rapid rate of metabolism for some substrates by this enzyme. Results are also 
expressed in units of menadione/activity (n or pmoles cytochrome c reduced / minute 
/ U). One U is defined as the amount of enzyme which reduces 1  p mole cytochrome 
c / minute. Kinetic constants were determined from Hanes Woolf plots where 
substrate concentration (S) / initial velocity (v) is plotted against substrate 
concentration as this has been reported to be the favourable graphical representation 
from which to determine such parameter values (Henderson, 1978). Values were 
obtained using the computer package Enzyme Kinetics (Trinity Software, Campton, 
NH, USA) and were confirmed by comparison with other graphical methods. Some 
values of substrate concentration were observed to inhibit the enzyme reaction or to 
be saturating to a great extent when displayed as a substrate against initial velocity 
plot. These were omitted, in the conventional way, in calculations of kinetic 
constants as they would skew the data.

Chapter 3  
Reductive Metabolism of Indoloquinones
3.1 Introduction
As discussed in Chapter 1  quinone compounds may undergo one-electron reduction 
catalysed by a variety of enzymes including cytochrome P450s and 
NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase amongst others to generate semiquinone free 
radicals. These may be toxic in their own right but under aerobic conditions are 
generally unstable and undergo auto-oxidation to regenerate the parent quinone. This 
process of redox cycling concomitantly generates potentially damaging oxygen-based 
radicals and may lead to oxidative stress. In contrast two-electron reduction catalysed 
by DT-diaphorase generates the hydroquinone species. This bypasses the toxic 
radical producing intermediates, at least initially, and is therefore often considered to 
be a detoxification process. However some compounds such as bioreductive 
alkylating agents possess groups which are activated upon two-electron reduction and 
thus in these cases DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction may actually result in 
activation.
Studies described here have examined the potential of DT-diaphorase and NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase to catalyse reduction of E09 because of their broad 
substrate specificity and in particular because of their ability to catalyse metabolism 
of structurally similar compounds to E09, e.g. quinoneimines (Powis et al,  1987), 
1,4-naphthoquinones (Buffington et al,  1989), anthraquinones (Fisher et al,  1992), 
menadione (Emster et al,  1962) and mitomycin C (Bachur et al,  1979; Siegel et al,  
1990b).
Previous experiments carried out by Walton and co-workers (1991, 1992b) have 
shown that E09 could undergo metabolism catalysed by rat Walker tumour DT- 
diaphorase. The aims of experiments described in this chapter were initially to 
confirm that E09 could be reduced by DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of rat 
Walker cells and to fully characterise the kinetic parameters using a highly purified 
(>95%) form of the rat Walker enzyme. As no purified human DT-diaphorase was 
made available the reductive ability of the enzyme present in sonicates of HT29 cells 
was examined. Walton and co-workers had also previously shown that this human
45
enzyme was able to reduce E09 (100 |iM) although kinetic parameters were not 
determined.
Structural modification has been reported to alter DT-diaphorase catalysed 
metabolism of a range of compounds. For example, the dinitrophenyl aziridine 
antitumour agent CB 1954 and its analogues 5-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzamide and 3,5- 
dinitrobenzamide were able to readily undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase 
derived from rat Walker cells (Knox et al,  1988b) whereas 2,4-dinitro-5-(2'- 
hydroxyethylamino)-benzamide was not (Knox et al,  1988b). Similarly the 
benzotriazine-di-N-oxide SR 4233 acted as a substrate for DT-diaphorase as did the 
four-electron reduced analogue SR 4330, however the two-electron reduced derivative 
SR 4317 was not detectably metabolised by this enzyme (Riley and Workman, 
1992a). For this reason a selected range of analogues related to E09 were also 
studied (Fig 3.1). It was hoped that the information obtained may aid understanding 
of the structural features preferred for metabolism by this enzyme and facilitate an 
'enzyme-directed approach' to the design of improved agents (Workman and Walton, 
1990, Workman, 1994). Finally, the effect of hypoxia and pH on DT-diaphorase 
metabolism have been examined because of their possible physiological relevance in 
tumour tissue (Chapter 1).
DT-diaphorase-mediated metabolism was monitored directly by UV visible 
spectrophotometry, HPLC and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). ESR 
permits detection of drug-based free radical metabolites in addition to oxygen radicals 
which may be concomitantly generated during reductive metabolism, as discussed 
above. Thus ESR method provides an alternative method for detecting reduction and 
in addition provides valuable information about reactive metabolites which due to 
their instability may be difficult to detect using other techniques.
3.2 Methods
3.2.1 Spectrophotometric Assay for Metabolism of Quinones - Aerobic  
Conditions
Indoloquinone metabolism was determined spectrophotometrically using the 
cytochrome c reduction assay described previously (Chapter 2). In this assay, 
cytochrome c acts as the terminal electron acceptor and reporter molecule for quinone 
reduction. Purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase as well as sonicates of both rat Walker

Fig. 3.1 Chemical structure of indoloquinones related to E09
and human HT29 colon carcinoma cells (Chapter 2) were used as sources of the 
enzyme. Where sonicates were employed potassium cyanide (KCN; 1  mM) was also 
added to the reaction mixture to inhibit mitochondrial enzymes (Stryer, 1981). 
Results were calculated in terms of both mg of protein and in units of menadione 
activity to account for any small between day differences in enzyme activity.
To confirm results obtained using this assa^ reduction was also monitored directly in 
the absence of cytochrome c by following change in absorbance of the reaction 
components over the range 200 nm - 700 nm at 1  minute intervals for a 10 minute 
period. For these experiments a quartz cuvette was used to permit measurement over 
the range of wavelengths examined, the cofactor, NADH concentration was reduced 
to 200 |iM and E09 and purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase were employed at 
concentrations of 50 |iM and 0.25 jug respectively in a total volume of 1  ml.
Additional experiments monitored loss of E09 absorbance, under aerobic conditions, 
at 500 nm. Although this was not the X max of E09 it was selected because it was a 
principal wavelength at which E09 continued to absorb light but which avoided 
overlap with the absorption peak of the nicotinamide cofactor, NADH. Due to the 
oxygen sensitivity of E09 metabolites a small magnetic flea was included in the 
cuvette (3 ml volume) where possible to ensure complete mixing of the reaction 
components. In order to accommodate a magnetic stirrer an LKB spectrophotometer 
(LKB Ultrospec 4050, Pharmacia, Milton Keynes, UK) was employed with a 
magnetic pad placed beneath it. This replaced the Kontron machine used for all other 
experiments. Reaction constituents included E09 (100 |iM), NADH (500 jliM) and 
purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (5 jig) in a total volume of 3 ml Tris-Cl buffer (50 
mM; pH 7.5) containing BSA (0.14%)
3.2.2 Effect of Hypoxia on Metabolism of Indoloquinones
The effect of hypoxia on the metabolism of the indoloquinones E09, E08, E07 and 
EO88 catalysed by purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase was investigated by the 
cytochrome c reduction assay described in Chapter 2. A special apparatus was used 
for these experiments. This consisted of a quartz cuvette with an outlet tube and 
Thunberg type bulb attached (Belmont Instruments, Glasgow, Scotland, UK). Plastic 
cuvettes were not used due to possible absorption of oxygen by the surface. Reaction 
constituents were identical to those for aerobic studies. The NADH cofactor, used to 
initiate the reaction was placed in the bulb at the top of the apparatus and was 
therefore separated from the remaining reaction constituents located in the cuvette.
47
The latter was attached via a short length of tubing to a glass manifold fitted with a 
two way tap. This in turn was connected to a vacuum and to a gas cylinder containing 
nitrogen (black spot grade < 6 parts per million; British Oxygen Company, London, 
UK). By use of the two way tap the sample was alternately evacuated and gassed at 
approximately 5 second intervals over a period of 5 minutes. Individual experiments 
in which the gassing procedure was extended from 5 to 15 minutes, nitrogen was 
substituted for helium (black spot grade; British Oxygen Company) and an oxygen 
trap was included, confirmed the gassing procedure was sufficient for hypoxia to be 
induced. The reaction was initiated by rapid inversion of the cuvette. The effect of 
hypoxia on DT-diaphorase metabolism was further investigated by HPLC as 
described below.
3.2.3 Effect of pH on the Metabolism of E09
The effect of pH on E 09 metabolism was again examined by the cytochrome c 
reduction assay. This was essentially as described in Chapter 2, however Tris-Cl 
buffer was substituted with sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM) due to its broader 
buffering capacity. Comparison was made of both buffers at pH 7.4. Metabolism 
was investigated at pH 7.8, 7.4, 7.0, 6.4 and 5.8. Menadione was included as a 
standard and mitomycin C as a positive control.
3.2.4 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
Enzyme catalysed reduction of E09 was carried out essentially as described for the 
spectrophotometric assay (Chapter 2) except for the exclusion of cytochrome c. 
Reaction constituents included E09 (100 pM), NADH (500 pM) and 5 ng, 50 ng, 250 
ng or 25 pg of purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase in a total volume of 1  ml Tris-Cl 
buffer pH 7.5 containing BSA (0.14%). These were placed in an Eppindorff tube, 
mixed, 0.5 ml was transferred to a 0.7 ml HPLC vial and the reaction was kept on ice 
until being initiated by incubation at 37°C. Reduction was monitored by HPLC by 
following change in absorbance of E09, cofactor NADH and metabolites using a 
Gilson HPLC (Gilson, Anachem, Luton, Beds., UK) with a Partisphere C18 column 
and a mobile phase of 40% methanol 60% water. Following initiation of E09 
reduction, aliquots of 10 pi were injected on to the HPLC column at 6 minute 
intervals for analysis. Detection was carried out at 260 nm and 340 nm wavelength 
and also by monitoring fluorescence using a diode array detector (1000S diode array 
detector, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). Controls involved 
omitting individual reaction components i.e. enzyme, NADH and drug.

3.2.5 Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (ESR)
Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was carried out using a Varian E l09 Century 
Series X-band (9.3 GHz) spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, 
USA). ESR parameters were in general: scan range ±  50 G, time constant 1  second, 
modulation amplitude 1.25 G, receiver gain 1.25 x 105  and 1.25 x 106, microwave 
power 5 mW, field set 3394 G, scan time 4 minutes, modulation frequency 100 cps 
and microwave frequency 9.51 G. All reactions were carried out at room temperature.
Standard reaction constituents included: DT-diaphorase (0.25 pg) or NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase (1.3 pg), E09 (800 pM dissolved in DMSO) and NADPH 
(1 mM) made up to a total volume of 400 pi Tris-Cl buffer pH 7.4. Where DT- 
diaphorase was used bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.14%) was also included to 
stabilise the enzyme. In some experiments the effect of altering DT-diaphorase 
concentration to 0.007 pg, 2 pg or 5 pg was also investigated. Spin trapping studies 
were carried out using DMPO (100 mM) and in the presence and absence of 
superoxide dismutase (400U) and catalase (200U). For inhibition studies dicoumarol 
(100 pM) or rabbit anti-rat Walker DT-diaphorase antiserum (43 pi) were included. 
The latter was preincubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with purified DT- 
diaphorase before addition of other reaction components. Control experiments were 
carried out where enzyme alone was preincubated for 15 minutes to ensure that no 
damage was occurring to the DT-diaphorase during this period. Reactions were 
initiated by addition of cofactor to the reaction mixture and rapidly mixing. NADH 
(1-2 mM) was supplemented for NADPH in some assays with DT-diaphorase. 
Constituents were then transferred directly to the flat cell for analysis by ESR.

3.1 Kinetic parameters for the metabolism of menadione and 
indoloquinone E09 catalysed by DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of 
rat Walker and human HT29 tumour cells. Data are expressed per mg 
of protein. Where more than two independent repeat experiments were 
carried out data are stated as a mean ± standard error with the number 
of individual experiments (n). For studies with less than two repeats 
results of individual experiments are given. The effect of varying

concentration of 2% and (b) of 1% in the reaction buffer.
by DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of both rat Walker and human HT29 tumour 
cells. Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, dicoumarol (lOOpM) 
decreased menadione reductase activity by 96-97% in the case of the Walker extract 
and 94-95% for the human preparation at saturating substrate concentrations. 
Progress curves were observed to be linear for, in general, the first 30 seconds of the 
assay over the range of substrate concentrations examined and at the lower 
concentrations they remained linear for even longer periods (data not shown). Initial 
velocity (v) was calculated from the linear portion of these progress curves. When v 
was plotted against substrate concentration (S) this gave a rectangular hyperbola (Fig 
3.2) indicative of an enzyme reaction conforming to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This 
was particularly clear for the Walker preparation (Fig 3.2 a). An increase in initial 
velocity was seen as substrate concentration increased with saturation occurring at 
around 25 pM menadione for both Walker and HT29 cell sonicates. Activity was 
shown to be linear with respect to enzyme concentration over the range examined 
(data not shown). Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax are displayed in Table 3.1. 
These were calculated from the Hanes Woolf plot for menadione with both Walker 
and HT29 enzyme preparations, as is shown in Fig 3.3 a. The linearity of these plots 
provided the evidence of Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km values obtained for the 
rat and human cell DT-diaphorase were similar at around 2-7 pM whereas the 
maximum reduction rates (Vmax) differed by approximately 8 fold between the two 
preparations, the Walker extracts being the most active.
E09
Using the cytochrome c reduction assay E09 was also shown to undergo efficient 
reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of both rat Walker tumour 
cell and human HT29 colon carcinoma cells in the presence of cofactor NADH (Fig
3.3 b). As for menadione, reaction kinetics were consistent with Michaelis-Menten 
behaviour. The rate of indoloquinone reduction appeared linear with respect to DT- 
diaphorase concentration over the range examined (results not shown). Controls 
where either enzyme or cofactor were omitted resulted in very low levels of 
background activity (data not shown). In the case of Walker cells both the mean 
Vmax, of 2.3 pmol cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg protein and mean Km, of 16 
pM were only ~6 fold lower and higher respectively than the benchmark substrate 
menadione. In the case of HT29 cell sonicates the Vmax was approximately 16-17 
fold lower than that of menadione while the Km value was only four fold higher 
(Table 3.1). Thus with E09 as a substrate the rat Walker cells were more active with 
regard to DT-diaphorase activity than HT29 cells. Inclusion of dicoumarol (100 pM),

the inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, reduced the activity by -96-97% at saturating 
substrate concentrations for the Walker enzyme and by around 65% for the HT29 cell 
preparation. The dicoumarol inhibitable activity in the sonicates was attributed to 
metabolism catalysed by DT-diaphorase and the residual assigned to other enzymes.
E09 Analogues
Reduction of indoloquinone derivatives of E09 was also found to be catalysed by 
DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of the rat and human tumour cells with activity 
varying according to the structural modification made (Table 3.2). As in the case of 
E09, reduction of the analogues was linear with increasing enzyme concentration and 
minimal activity was observed in the absence of cofactor, enzyme or drug (data not 
shown). For the rat Walker enzyme both the methyl-aziridine compound, E08 and 
E07, the analogue possessing a methoxy substituent in place of the aziridine, 
exhibited reduced activity compared to E09 when considering Vmax values (0.138 
and 0.993 pmol / minute / mg for E08 and E07 respectively compared with a mean 
of 2.3 |Limol / minute / mg for E09). The Km value for E07 of 5.44 |iM was, 
however, lower than that of E09 (16 pM) although that of E08 was higher being 49.1 
jiM. In the case of the HT29 cell enzyme both E07 and E08 acted as poorer 
substrates than E09 in terms of Vmax but exhibited lower Km values of (9.15 pM 
and 5.78 pM respectively compared with 17.35 pM for E09). E07 acted as a better 
substrate for both enzyme preparations than E08 in terms of Vmax values. The Km 
for E07 was approximately 10 fold lower than that of E08 for the Walker cell 
enzyme but was similar in the case of the HT29 enzyme. EO 88, the compound 
possessing a carbamate leaving group in place of the hydroxyl leaving group in E09 
at the X 2 position was however able to undergo five fold more rapid reduction 
catalysed by rat Walker cell DT-diaphorase than E09 itself when considering Vmax 
values. Furthermore the Km value was almost half that of E09. Interestingly for 
E05A, the aziridine ring-opened metabolite, no reduction was observed with either 
enzyme preparation at the limit of detection of the assay.
In addition to use of sonicates the reduction of E09 and its analogues was compared 
using a highly purified preparation of the rat Walker DT-diaphorase. As shown in Fig
3.4 and Tables 3.3 and 3.4 the purified DT-diaphorase was able to catalyse reduction 
of E 09 and various analogues. Metabolism of the indoloquinone analogues by 
purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase was of a similar order to that obtained using the 
sonicates although activity was of course proportionally higher when expressed per 
mg of protein. For example, EO 88 was confirmed as a more efficient substrate with

lower Vmax but also a 5-fold lower Km compared to E09 while E08 showed a much 
lower Vmax but a smaller Km. Two additional compounds were screened with the 
purified enzyme, E072 which possessed a carboxymethyl leaving groups in place of 
the hydroxyl leaving group of E09 (Fig 3.1) and E016 where the aziridine was 
substituted with a methoxy group and the R 5 methyl group was replaced by a butyl. 
Both E072 and E016 were poorly metabolised by rat Walker DT-diaphorase (data 
not shown) with activity being around the background levels of the assay.
Mitomycin C
Reduction of mitomycin C catalysed by purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase was also 
examined. Experiments were limited to two concentrations of mitomycin C as this 
compound was an extremely poor substrate for DT-diaphorase and more detailed 
studies would have necessitated the use of large quantities of enzyme. At a drug 
concentration of 100 pM, DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction of mitomycin C was 
approximately 150 fold slower than for E09 with an activity of 2.84 pmoles 
cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg of enzyme (taken from a mean of 2 repeat assays 
carried out within the same experiment). Where a concentration of 50 pM mitomycin 
C was employed the activity was 0.895 ± 0.304 pM cytochrome c reduced / minute / 
mg DT-diaphorase (mean ± SD where n=4) which was around 720 fold lower than 
E09.
Direct Spectrophotometry
In order to provide further evidence for E09 reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase, 
changes in the concentrations of reaction constituents were measured directly by 
spectrophotometry. This was carried out over an absorbance range of 200-700 nm 
and also by monitoring change in absorbance of E09 specifically at a fixed 
absorbance of 500 nm. For these experiments conditions were changed slightly from 
those described for the cytochrome c reduction assay described earlier. The principal 
difference was that cytochrome c was omitted. Other constituents varied in 
concentration and are described below.
Experiments monitoring change in absorbance between 200-700 nm wavelength 
during the reduction of E09 (50 pM) by DT-diaphorase (0.25 pg / ml) showed a 
decrease in peak height at 340 nm over a 10 minute period consistent with loss of the 
cofactor NADH (200 pM) (Fig 3.5). Controls where drug was substituted by vehicle

alone or where enzyme was omitted resulted in no detectable decrease in NADH peak 
height. Little reduction in absorbance was noted at 450-550 nm wavelength which 
corresponds to E09 under these conditions. However, in experiments where E09 
(100 pM) absorbance was monitored continuously at 500 nm wavelength during 
reduction catalysed by a higher concentration of DT-diaphorase (5 jig / 3 ml) in the 
presence of an increased concentration of NADH (500 jiM) a decrease in the reading 
was observed (data not shown). The absorbance remained low for ~3 minutes before 
increasing to near original levels after ~6-7 minutes. The reduction was visible to the 
naked eye as a change from the purple coloured E09 to colourless on initiation of 
reaction, followed by regeneration of purple coloration. The reappearance of colour 
was initially evident at the reaction mixture / air interface but with the aid of a 
magnetic flea was made uniform throughout the cuvette.
3.3.2 The Effect of Hypoxia on DT-diaphorase Metabolism of Indoloquinones
The initial velocity of DT-diaphorase metabolism of E09, E08 (Fig 3.6 b), E07 and 
EO88 (Fig 3.6 a) was found to be almost identical under hypoxic and aerobic 
conditions as determined by the cytochrome c reduction assay.
3.3.3 The Effect of pH on DT-diaphorase Metabolism of E09
When Tris-Cl buffer and sodium phosphate buffer were compared at pH 7.4 with both 
the standard substrate menadione (50 jiM) and E09 (50 jiM and 10 jliM) only slight 
differences in rate were observed. The effect of changing pH to 5.8 was also 
examined. The rate of menadione reduction catalysed by purified rat Walker DT- 
diaphorase decreased by -30 % with lowering pH whereas that of E09 showed a 20% 
decrease at 50 JiM but no change at 10 JiM. Subsequent experiments were carried out 
to further investigate the effect of altering pH on E09 metabolism over a wider range 
including 7.8, 7.4, 7.0, 6.4, and 5.8. Results indicated that at concentrations of both 
50 jiM and 10 pM menadione, DT-diaphorase-catalysed metabolism was more rapid 
at pH 7.4 with activity decreasing both above and below this level (Fig 3.7 a). In 
contrast, E09 (50 pM and 10 pM) showed little variation over the range of pH values 
examined although if anything a slight optimum was seen at pH 7.0 (Fig 3.7 b).
Mitomycin C was also included in these experiments as studies carried out using 
HPLC analysis by Siegel and co-workers (1990b) had noted a profound effect of pH 
on reduction by purified rat hepatic DT-diaphorase. Interestingly, using the 
cytochrome c reduction assay, we observed no difference in the initial velocity of

3.3.4 DT-diaphorase Catalysed Reduction of E09: HPLC
HPLC experiments confirmed that E09 could undergo reduction catalysed by purified 
rat Walker cell DT-diaphorase. This was indicated by a decrease in peak height of 
NADH cofactor which eluted at 0.55-0.6 minutes (Fig 3.8). Interestingly, only a 
slight decrease in the peak height of E09 itself was observed. As in the case of 
spectrophotometric assays, increasing enzyme concentration increased the rate of 
reduction of E09 as measured by loss of cofactor (data not shown). Little change was 
noted for control incubations where either enzyme or drug were omitted.
The effect of hypoxia on DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of E 09 was also 
examined. Following reduction of E09 results revealed the formation of a colourless 
metabolite, as visualised by the naked eye. This was presumably the hydroquinone. 
However, when this sample was injected into the HPLC equipment the chromatogram 
again showed little or no decrease in E09 peak height, indicating that reoxidation had 
occurred during the analyses.
3.3.5 DT-diaphorase and NADPH: Cytochrome P450 Reductase Catalysed  
Reduction of Quinones: ESR Experiments
Radical Formation Following DT-diaphorase Reduction o fE 0 9
Aerobic incubation of E09 (800 pM), purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (0.25 pg) 
and cofactor NADPH (1 mM) in a total volume of 400 pi buffer (Tris Cl and 0.14% 
BSA) led to the production of a highly reproducible ESR spectrum. This was 
apparent 3 minutes after initiation of the reaction (Fig 3.9, spectrum a). Signal 
intensity increased over time and after 8 minutes it was clearly distinguishable as an 8 
line spectrum (Fig 3.9, spectrum b) which was stable over 30 minutes (not shown). 
The spectrum is characteristic of a drug-based radical, and by analogy with other 
quinones this almost certainly represents the semiquinone species. Interestingly, 
either decreasing the DT-diaphorase concentration to 0.007 pg or increasing it to 2 pg 
or 5 pg resulted in abrogation of the detection of drug-based radicals (data not 
shown).

A series of control experiments were carried out. The generation of a detectable 
signal was blocked by inclusion of the inhibitor dicoumarol (500 JiM) (Fig 3.9, 
spectrum c), pre-incubation with rabbit anti-rat DT-diaphorase antiserum (43 jil) (Fig 
3.9, spectrum d) and omission of the cofactor NADPH (Fig 3.9, spectrum e), E09 
(Fig 3.9, spectrum f) or DT-diaphorase (Fig 3.9, spectrum g).
Replacing the cofactor NADPH (1 mM) with NADH (1 mM) gave almost identical 
results (Fig 3.10). This Figure also illustrates that an increase in cofactor 
concentration to 2 mM gave a similar intensity of peak initially but after 9 minutes 
this began to decrease in a linear fashion, leaving no detectable peak after 24 minutes.
Given that DT-diaphorase is thought to catalyse direct two-electron reduction to the 
hydroquinone the presence of a drug-based radical here would suggest that auto­
oxidation may have occurred. Thus it would be expected that oxygen-based radicals 
would also have been generated. These radicals such as the superoxide anion are 
highly unstable and therefore due to their short life span are extremely difficult to 
detect by conventional ESR. For this reason spin traps are commonly included to 
permit detection of short lived oxygen-based radicals. The nitrone compound 
DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-l-oxide) has been used successfully in similar 
experiments involving the aziridinylbenzoquinone bioreductive agent AZQ (Fisher 
and Gutierrez, 1991a and b) and was therefore selected as the spintrap in these 
experiments. DMPO reacts with superoxide and hydroxyl radicals to form adducts 
with a longer lifetime and characteristic spectrum (Finkelstein, 1979). Following a 3 
minute reduction of E09 catalysed by DT-diaphorase a 6 line spectrum was observed 
(Fig 3.11, spectrum a). This is characteristic of a DMPO-CH 3 radical formed on 
reaction of DMSO, present as the drug solvent, with the DMPO-OH radical (Pou et 
al, 1989). On theoretical grounds, the methyl-DMPO radical should appear as a 
1:1:1:1:1:1 spectrum. However presumably, due to the short life span of the adduct, 
signal intensity decreased during the initial 3 minute scan resulting in peaks of 
unequal height. There is also some indication of a further radical present masked by 
the oxygen-related species. The 8 minute scan (Fig 3.11, spectra b and c), where total 
loss of oxygen radicals has occurred, revealed this to be the E09-based radical which 
then remained stable over 29 minutes (not shown).
Use of superoxide dismutase and catalase enabled more clear identification the source 
of oxygen radicals produced in the system (Fig 3.11). Inclusion of these two enzymes 
led to an inability to detect oxygen-based radicals (Fig 3.11, spectra d and e). The 
quality of the E09-based radical (Fig 3.11, spectrum e) remained unaffected by

addition of both superoxide dismutase and catalase but was delayed in appearance 
(not present at 3 minutes; Fig 3.11, spectrum d) and was diminished in size (Fig 3.11,

(Fig 3.11, spectra f and g). In contrast, superoxide dismutase alone resulted in no 
inhibition of oxygen radical - DMPO adducts and may have even increased the signal 
intensity to a small extent (Fig 3.11, spectrum h).

(Fig 3.11, spectrum k), E09 (Fig 3.11, spectrum 1 ) or DT-diaphorase (Fig 3.11, 
spectrum m), from the system also resulted in loss of signal.
Radical Formation Following NADPH: Cytochrome P450 Reductase Metabolism of  
E09
In addition to DT-diaphorase, other enzymes are likely to play a role in metabolism of 
E09. NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase, having been shown to catalyse 
metabolism of similar compounds was a probable candidate and was therefore 
examined here by ESR. Incubation of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase with E09 
in the presence of cofactor produced a detectable radical 4 minutes after initiation of 
the reaction (Fig 3.12, spectrum a). As with DT-diaphorase, this was an 8 line 
spectrum characteristic of a drug-based radical, presumably the semiquinone species. 
This was persistent over 30 minutes (not shown). Similarly, as in the case of DT- 
diaphorase, formation of the drug-based radical was dependent on the presence of 
NADPH (Fig 3.12, spectrum b), E09 (Fig 3.12, spectrum c) and cytochrome P450 
reductase (Fig 3.12, spectrum d) as removal of any one of these components resulted 
in abolition of the signal.
Spin trap studies with DMPO revealed the presence of oxygen-based radicals 
following 5 minutes activation of E09 by purified cytochrome P 450 reductase (Fig 
3.13, spectrum a). This was also a 6 line spectrum characteristic of a DMPO-methyl 
radical. Clearly superimposed upon this is the appearance of a semiquinone radical, 
more evident after 10 minutes where complete loss of the short lived oxygen-based 
radicals has occurred (Fig 3.13, spectrum b). This E09 radical was fairly stable over 
30 minutes (not shown). Oxygen-based radical production, like that of the drug, was 
also dependent on the presence of cofactor (Fig 3.13, spectrum c), drug (Fig 3.13, 
spectrum d) and NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (Fig 3.13, spectrum e).

Addition of either superoxide dismutase and catalase (Fig 3.13, spectra f and g), or 
catalase alone (Fig 3.13, spectrum j) resulted in inhibition of the oxygen-based radical 
although the presence of the drug-based radical was maintained. This was therefore 
similar to the pattern observed with DT-diaphorase. Where superoxide dismutase was 
included the DMPO- methyl radical was still apparent (Fig 3.13, spectra h and i), but 
was reduced in intensity.
3.4 Discussion
The structural similarity of E09 to other quinone substrates of DT-diaphorase 
suggested that this enzyme may play a role in metabolism of E09. At the outset of 
this thesis, previous work in our laboratory had shown that sonicates of rat Walker 
cells could catalyse reduction of E09 (Walton et al,  1991; 1992b). This activity was 
inhibitable by dicoumarol, thus indicating the involvement of DT-diaphorase. 
Preliminary experiments with human HT29 cells had given similar results (Walton et 
al, 1992b). For this reason, the studies described here examined the ability of DT- 
diaphorase present in sonicates of rat Walker tumour and human HT29 colon 
carcinoma cells, as well as a purified form of the enzyme, to catalyse reduction of 
E09 and related indoloquinone compounds.
A number of methods are available for analysing the reduction of agents by DT- 
diaphorase. Commonly used techniques include the use of HPLC or direct 
spectrophotometry to monitor the loss of the agent or NAD(P)H cofactor. Both of 
these methods have limitations. HPLC is fairly time consuming, particularly when 
determining kinetic parameters for a large number of substrates and tends to require 
relatively large quantities of drug and enzyme both of which were in limited supply. 
It does however have advantages of monitoring unambiguously the individual 
reaction components and often permits identification of the metabolites. The 
spectrophotometric method is even more direct but has complications for agents such 
as the aziridinylbenzoquinones which absorb at around 340 nm, a wavelength which 
is coincident with that of the cofactors NADH and NADPH. In addition, a large 
number of the quinone compounds have reduced metabolites which are oxygen 
sensitive and therefore it is difficult to determine kinetics by following the loss of 
parent drug unless anaerobic conditions are employed. One method of clarifying the 
levels of auto-oxidation is by also measuring oxygen consumption. Because of these 
complications, the cytochrome c reduction assay was employed routinely in this 
thesis. Although this is an indirect method because reduction of the quinone is
57
monitored via cytochrome c as the terminal electron acceptor and reporter molecule, it 
has the advantages of being rapid and widely acceptable, permitting screening of a 
large number of analogues, and also of high sensitivity, thus utilising less drug and 
enzyme.
Results presented in this chapter, using a variety of techniques, have provided strong 
evidence that DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of rat Walker and human HT29 
tumour cells is able to catalyse the metabolism of E09. Further unambiguous support 
in the case of the Walker tumour was provided by the observation that the reduction 
of E09 and certain analogues was also catalysed by the DT-diaphorase purified from 
this source.
E09 acted as an excellent substrate for DT-diaphorase being only 4-6 fold poorer in 
terms of Vmax than the conventional benchmark substrate menadione in the case of 
the rat Walker tumour sonicate and 14-16 fold poorer for the human sonicate. The 
Km values for E09 with both sonicates were also higher than those obtained with 
menadione. Similar results were obtained with the purified DT-diaphorase although 
in this case activity per mg of protein was obviously higher than that exhibited by 
sonicates. Interestingly this novel anticancer drug was very much more efficiently 
metabolised by DT-diaphorase at pH 7.4 than was mitomycin C, the prototype 
bioreductive alkylating agent. Overall these results compare well with those obtained 
by Walton and co-workers (1992b).
It was observed that rat Walker tumour cells were more active than the human HT29 
colon carcinoma cells with respect to DT-diaphorase activity. This may be due to 
differences in the concentrations of DT-diaphorase present in the two cell lines or 
alternatively to the enzymes differing in their ability to reduce the indoloquinones on 
a molecule to molecule basis. Western blotting experiments suggested that Walker 
cells possessed more DT-diaphorase protein than HT29 cells although this may reflect 
differences in cross-reactivity of antibody used (data not shown). In order to 
understand the basis of this difference a purified form of the human enzyme was 
required and was not available during the time course of this thesis. Subsequent 
experiments carried out by Dr A. Lewis in our laboratory have further investigated 
this issue by using recombinant forms of rat and human DT-diaphorase produced in 
bacteria (Lewis et al , 1994, Chen et al,  in press). The rat recombinant form of the 
enzyme was shown to compare well with the purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase with 
regard to its metabolism of E09. Importantly, the recombinant rat enzyme was able 
to catalyse reduction of E09 approximately seven times more efficiently than the
58
recombinant human enzyme. Providing that the recombinant human enzyme also acts 
as a good model for the intrinsic human cell DT-diaphorase, these data would support 
the hypothesis that the rat Walker enzyme was able to catalyse reduction of E09 more 
efficiently than the form of the enzyme present in HT29 colon carcinoma cells. A 
similar difference in the reducing ability of rat Walker cell DT-diaphorase and human 
Hep-G2 cell DT-diaphorase has also been observed with CB 1954 using purified 
forms of the enzyme (Boland et al,  1991).
It must be emphasised that experiments utilising sonicates of rat Walker and human 
HT29 cells as a source of enzyme rely on the inclusion of the inhibitor dicoumarol for 
determination of DT-diaphorase activity. Dicoumarol was originally thought to be a 
specific inhibitor of DT-diaphorase but more recently has been reported to inhibit a 
xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase (Gustafson and Pritsos, 1992b), carbonyl 
reductase (Wermuth, 1981), NADH cytochrome reductase (Hodnick and Sartorelli, 
1993) and a variety of other enzymes (for detailed references see Murray et al,  1982). 
Despite these concerns the affinity of DT-diaphorase for dicoumarol is however 
extremely high and it is expected that this would provide a reasonable measure of the 
role played by DT-diaphorase, particularly in the high expressing cell lines used here. 
Furthermore the involvement of DT-diaphorase in catalysing reduction of the 
indoloquinones was demonstrated unambiguously using the highly purified form of 
the rat Walker enzyme.
Structural modification of compounds has previously been reported to alter their 
ability to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase. An understanding of the 
key structural features may be important for future drug design to give optimal 
activity, advocated by the 'enzyme-directed approach' (Workman and Walton, 1990; 
Workman, 1994). For this reason the DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction of a range of 
structural analogues of E09 was examined.
Quite subtle structural modification of E09 resulted in an altered ability to be 
metabolised by purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase as well as that present in the rat 
Walker and human HT29 cell sonicates. Interestingly the 2-hydroxyethylamino 
derivative E05A, in which the aziridine ring of E09 has been opened was extremely 
poorly metabolised, if at all. A similar phenomenon has been described for the 
aziridine ring-opened analogue of CB 1954 2,4-dinitro-5-(2'-hydroxyethylamino)- 
benzamide (Knox et al,  1988b). This suggests a preference for an intact aziridine ring 
for DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction. However the results obtained with E07 
suggest that this is not a unique structural requirement. E07 has a methoxy
59
substituent in place of the aziridine moiety and yet still undergoes efficient 
metabolism catalysed by both human and rat DT-diaphorase. This conclusion is 
substantiated by experiments carried out by Knox and co-workers (1988b) which 
revealed that the analogues of CB 1954, 5-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzamide and 3,4- 
dinitrobenzamide, which also lack the aziridine group, are however still reduced by 
this enzyme. Nevertheless, E08, the methylaziridine analogue, and E07 both acted 
as poorer substrates for rat Walker and human HT29 cell DT-diaphorase than did 
E09. Interestingly, E088, an analogue which retains the aziridine moiety but also 
exhibits a carbamate leaving group at the X 2 position in place of the hydroxyl group 
of E 09 (Fig 3.1) was much more efficiently metabolised by the enzyme when 
comparing both Km and Vmax values. This observation highlights an additional area 
of the molecule where relatively minor structural modification can result in an 
unexpected enhancement of DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction.
The reduction potential of a compound, which might be expected to determine its 
ability to undergo enzymatic reduction, will clearly be influenced by the nature of the 
molecular substituents. In the case of the indoloquinones related to E 09 all the 
groups at the R\ and R .2 position of the molecule are electron donating. The greater 
the capacity of the particular substituent to donate electrons the nore negative will be 
its reduction potential and the more readily it would be predicted to undergo 
reduction. A limited amount of data are available regarding the half-wave potentials 
(Ei^) of the indoloquinones (on file at the EORTC). These values were determined 
electrochemically at pH 8 using a Ag/Ag Cl reference electrode. Reduction potentials 
determined in this way may have some limitations but serve to give a relative order 
for predicted ease of reduction which was, from most to least electronegative, 
E09>E08>E07 for the indoloquinones. Although no value was available for EO 88 it 
would be expected to be similar to E09 as substituents at the leaving groups would be 
unlikely to have much effect on the redox potential of the quinone. Interestingly, 
despite only small differences in the Ej^ values, large differences were observed in the 
ability of the indoloquinones to undergo DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction. 
Moreover, the order of metabolism does not directly follow that predicted by 
reduction potential. Thus, redox potentials do not appear to be of great benefit in 
predicting DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of indoloquinone compounds within 
the range examined. It is likely however, that a threshold level for reduction potential 
will exist beyond which reduction becomes more difficult. This could be examined 
using other analogues with far more negative reduction potentials. Such a threshold 
level has been suggested for quinone epoxides between -500 mV and -600 mV 
(Brunmark et al,  1988). A lack of correlation of redox potential and DT-diaphorase
60
mediated reduction has been reported for a variety of other compounds such as 1,4- 
napthoquinones (Buffington et al,  1989) and quinone epoxides (Brunmark et al,  1988)
In addition to reduction potential, other factors would be expected to influence the 
ability to undergo reductive metabolism. These include steric considerations, in 
particular substrate fit in to the active site of the enzyme and lipophilicity. The effect 
of these parameters could be determined by examination of additional analogues.
DT-diaphorase, being an obligate two-electron reducing enzyme would be expected to 
convert quinones directly through to hydroquinones, thus avoiding the oxygen 
sensitive semiquinone radical stage. For this reason some authors have suggested that 
reduction catalysed by this enzyme should be unaffected by oxygen (see Workman, 
1992a). However, depending on the stability of the hydroquinone product, auto­
oxidation may or may not occur generating oxygen radicals and the semiquinone 
radical. In addition, comproportionation-disproportionation reactions may also 
generate radical products. Results presented in this chapter show that in the case of 
E09 and the analogues E08, E07 and EOS8 there was clearly no difference in the 
initial rate of DT-diaphorase reduction between aerobic and hypoxic conditions, as 
determined by the cytochrome c reduction assay. A similar lack of differential 
between aerobic and hypoxic metabolism catalysed by DT-diaphorase has also been 
reported for other bioreductive compounds including mitomycin C (Siegel et al,  
1990b), AZQ (Siegel et al,  1990a) and CB 1954 (Knox et al,  1988b). Hypoxia may 
however affect the nature and levels of the metabolites formed by affecting their 
stability. It must be emphasised that the present results were obtained using very brief 
reaction times.
Controversy exists over the pH status of solid tumours. Current opinion supports the 
view that the pH of extracellular fluid in tumours is more acidic than normal cells but 
that intracellular pH is well regulated (see Chapter 1). In light of these reports and the 
observation that activity of the quinone agent mitomycin C is enhanced under acidic 
conditions it was decided to investigate the effect of pH on the reduction of E09. 
Results obtained using the cytochrome c reduction assay showed that the rate of DT- 
diaphorase-mediated metabolism of E09 remained relatively constant over the pH 
range 5.8 - 7.8. These pH values were selected as pH values in human tumours as low 
as 5.8 have been reported (Vaupel et al,  1989). In addition, this was the range used in 
experiments carried out by Siegel and co-workers (1990b) on mitomycin C. 
Menadione, the conventional substrate for DT-diaphorase, was also examined as a 
control. The reduction rate as monitored by the cytochrome c reduction assay
61
decreased only slightly with decreasing pH over the range 7.4 - 5.8. This is consistent 
with the lack of appreciable decrease in menadione metabolism reported by Siegel 
and co-workers (1990b) at equivalent pH values. However, in contrast, to results 
obtained from Siegel and co-workers (1990b) data presented here showed no effect of 
pH on the DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of mitomycin C. A major difference is 
that Siegel and co-workers (1990b) used HPLC to monitor reduction in mitomycin C 
concentration after 30 minutes sample incubation. They suggested that the reason for 
the enhanced metabolism at lower pH values involved the pH dependent formation of 
the quinone methide metabolite. At high pH (above 7.4) this may alkylate DT- 
diaphorase thus inactivating it catalytically, whereas at lower pH values protonation 
of the metabolite may occur, thereby converting the quinone methide to 2,7- 
diaminomitosene which may be released from the enzyme permitting ongoing 
metabolism to proceed. In the present studies, the cytochrome c reduction assay was 
carried out over a 1-2 minute period. It is therefore possible that this gave insufficient 
time for extensive enzyme inactivation to occur, thus resulting in apparent lack of 
effect of pH on metabolism.
Phillips and co-workers (1992) found that the cytotoxic potency of E09 increased 
when extracellular pH was decreased from 7.5 to 5.8 (Phillips et al,  1992). In 
addition, they observed E09 to be unstable in media at acid pH at 37°C and identified 
E05A as a breakdown product. These authors suggested that the increased potency of 
E09 under acidic conditions may be due to either enhanced enzymatic activation of 
the indoloquinone in a similar manner to that reported for mitomycin C, or 
alternatively to chemical modification of E09. However, results presented in this 
chapter suggest that the initial rate of DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction is not 
affected within this pH range. In addition, intracellular pH has been reported to be 
well regulated and thus is unlikely to be affected by the low extracellular pH in 
tumours. Furthermore, the results discussed in this chapter have shown that the 
breakdown product E05A acts as a very poor substrate for DT-diaphorase. One 
explanation for the increased cytotoxicity observed by Phillips and co-workers (1992) 
is that a reactive intermediate may have been formed during breakdown of E09 to 
E05A which has not so far been detected. There is, however, no data to support this 
possibility.
In addition to the spectroscopy studies, HPLC experiments confirmed that E09 could 
be metabolised by purified rat Walker cell DT-diaphorase and that all components of 
the reaction mixture, i.e. enzyme, drug and cofactor, were required for this process to 
proceed. This evidence relied on a decrease in cofactor concentration. In contrast
62
relatively little decrease in E09 concentration was noted. It is likely that this ajgarent 
discrepancy was due to formation of a highly oxygen-sensitive metabolised DT- 
diaphorase, presumably the hydroquinone which, in the presence of molecular 
oxygen, was auto-oxidised to regenerate the parent compound. This would result in 
little overall loss in E09 while supporting a consumption of cofactor. Similar 
tendencies to undergo rapid auto-oxidation following metabolism by DT-diaphorase 
have been reported for the aziridinylbenzoquinone AZQ (Siegel et al, 1990a) but data 
reported by Siegel and co-workers (1990b) suggested that, in contrast, mitomycin C 
metabolites are insensitive to oxygen. In the case of experiments carried out under 
hypoxic conditions, the metabolite should have been stabilised and therefore have 
been detectable. Again the lack of decrease in E09 peak height suggested that auto­
oxidation was occurring during sample injection of the reduced metabolite on to the 
column implying extreme oxygen sensitivity. Spectrophotometric analysis of DT- 
diaphorase-catalysed reduction of E09 in the absence of cytochrome c revealed a 
decrease in absorbance of E09 at 500 nm wavelength immediately after initiation of 
the reaction. Following a lag period of a couple of minutes reappearance of a peak at 
500 nm was observed when air was introduced in to the system indicating formation 
of the parent compound. This reaction was visible with the naked eye as a conversion 
of the purple coloured E09 solution to colourless and then subsequent reappearance 
of the purple form. It is possible that a metabolite of E09 could also absorb light at 
500 nm however the HPLC data showing little loss of E09 supports the view that a 
E09 is reduced to a highly oxygen sensitive metabolite which is then reoxidised to 
E09 itself.
In order to further investigate the mechanism of the DT-diaphorase-catalysed 
reduction of E09 and to identify the nature of the metabolites, ESR studies were 
carried out. These revealed that DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of E 09 to 
generate a drug-based radical. This exhibited an 8 line spectrum and by analogy with 
other quinones this is likely to be the semiquinone radical. However, without further 
sophisticated computer analysis, it is not possible to definitively confirm the identity 
of this species.
DT-diaphorase, widely considered to be an obligate two-electron reducing 
flavoenzyme (Iyanagi and Yamazaki, 1970) would be expected to catalyse 
metabolism of E09 directly to a hydroquinone. On this simple model one would not 
have expected to see evidence of a semiquinone radical during this reduction process. 
However, similar results have been obtained following DT-diaphorase catalysed 
reduction of AZQ (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a). In this case it has been suggested
63
that the hydroquinone generated auto-oxidises to produce the semiquinone and parent 
compound. HPLC and spectrophotometric data presented in this chapter indicates a 
similar oxygen sensitivity of E09 metabolites and may provide an explanation for the 
generation of the semiquinone (Fig 3.14; Equation 1). An additional method by 
which the semiquinone radical could be generated under these conditions are by 
comproportionation : disproportionation reactions (Fig. 3.14; Equation 6). This may 
also contribute to the production of the semiquinone radical.
Controls where either drug, enzyme or cofactor were omitted showed no evidence of 
radical formation. This strongly supports the view that both oxygen radicals and 
drug-based radicals are generated following reduction of E09 catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase using NADPH as an electron donor. In addition, experiments where the 
DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol or anti-DT-diaphorase anti-serum were pre­
incubated with the enzyme, did not generate an ESR signal. These results further 
confirm the involvement of DT-diaphorase in reduction of E 09 and radical 
generation.
It is interesting that in experiments where either the enzyme concentration was 
lowered to 0.007 pg (in 400 j l lI reaction volume) or increased to 2 or 5 pg (in 400 pi) 
the drug-based radical was no longer observed. At lower enzyme concentrations it is 
likely that the hydroquinone is produced more slowly and therefore auto-oxidation 
occurs to generate the semiquinone and quinone without permitting sufficient 
amounts of semiquinone to build up to form a detectable signal. At higher enzyme 
concentrations, reduction of E09 would be very rapid and thus may quickly consume 
the oxygen present in the system causing the sealed flat cell to become hypoxic. 
Under these conditions the hydroquinone would be stabilised by preventing auto­
oxidation and therefore once again reducing the levels of semiquinone. This 
phenomenon would also suggest that the drug-based radical is predominantly formed 
by auto-oxidation rather than comproportionation : disproportionation reactions. 
Visible evidence existed for the occurrence of E09 metabolism at these higher 
enzyme concentrations in that the contents of the flat cell were observed to be 
colourless rather than possessing the purple coloration of the parent compound.
Consistent with the idea that the drug-based radical results from metabolism of E09 
catalysed by DT-diaphorase is the finding that replacing the cofactor NADPH with 
NADH gave almost identical results. As discussed previously (Chapter 1) a 
characteristic of this enzyme is its ability to utilise NADH and NADPH with equal 
efficiency. Increasing NADH concentration to 2 mM resulted in a similar initial peak

intensity to that obtained with 1  mM; however, in contrast to the result with 1  mM 
cofactor the signal began to decrease after 9 minutes giving no detectable peak after 
24 minutes (Fig 3.10). Based on the presumption that E09 is being reduced to the 
hydroquinone by DT-diaphorase and that auto-oxidation subsequently occurs, the 
additional amount of reducing equivalent may continue to drive the forward reaction 
until hypoxia prevails. This would stabilise the hydroquinone and result in negation 
of the radical species.
If the proposed mechanism (Fig 3.14; Equation 1) for the generation of semiquinone 
following DT-diaphorase metabolism of E09 is correct, oxygen-based radicals should 
also have been generated as a by-product (Fig 3.14; Equation 1). As previously 
discussed, due to the short life span of these species they are largely undetectable by 
conventional ESR. For this reason, the spin trap DMPO was employed. As expected, 
where DMPO was included a 6 line methyl-DMPO radical (Fig 3.14; Equation 8) was 
observed. This had an extremely short life span and rapidly disappeared being no 
longer present after 8 minutes. At this stage it was evident that the drug-based free 
radical was also present. The detection of oxygen radicals therefore confirmed that 
auto-oxidation of a DT-diaphorase metabolite, presumably the semiquinone, was 
occurring.
Identification of the oxygen radicals produced was possible by inclusion of 
superoxide dismutase and catalase. Superoxide is expected to be generated as a by­
product during auto-oxidation of the hydroquinone and semiquinone species (Fig 
3.14; Equation 1). This spontaneously dismutates to produce hydrogen peroxide and 
oxygen (Fig 3.14; Equation 2). Superoxide dismutase catalyses this reaction thus 
removing superoxide from the system. In addition superoxide dismutase should 
inhibit the reduction of Fe3+ which is part of the Haber-Weiss reaction (Fig 3.14; 
Equation 4 and 5). Catalase is involved in conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water 
and oxygen (Fig 3.14; Equation 3) and thus removes hydrogen peroxide from the 
system preventing the Fenton reaction (Fig 3.14; Equation 5). In the experiments 
described in this chapter superoxide dismutase did not result in inhibition of either the 
drug radical species or the DMPO-methyl radical. This would suggest that there was 
already sufficient reduced ferric ions present in the incubation to permit the Haber- 
Weiss reaction to occur. Inclusion of a metal ion chelator such as diethylenetriamine 
pentaacetic acid (DETEPAC) could clarify this issue by removing the ferric ions and 
thus abolish the signal observed. The lack of inhibition of the DMPO-methyl radical 
signal also indicates that H 2O2 is not generated significantly by hydroquinone 
oxidation by superoxide (Fig 3.14; Equation 7). Catalase inhibited the generation of
65
the DMPO-methyl radical (Fig 3.11), thus suggesting that hydrogen peroxide reacts 
with Fe2+  to generate OH" and OH*. The hydroxyl radical then reacts with DMSO to 
produce a methyl radical which reacts with DMPO to generate the DMPO-CH 3  
radical observed.
In addition to DT-diaphorase, other enzymes are likely to be involved in the reductive 
metabolism of E09. For this reason, and the fact that NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase has been reported to metabolise structurally similar substrates, this enzyme 
was investigated here. ESR studies carried out with NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase showed the generation of a drug-based radical similar to that produced 
following DT-diaphorase reduction. However, in contrast to DT-diaphorase this one- 
electron reducing enzyme would however be expected to catalyse the formation of 
E09 to the semiquinone radical in a single one-electron step (Fig 3.14, Equation 1). 
Once at its optimum intensity the radical remained stable over 30 minutes. It is likely 
that the semiquinone is highly oxygen sensitive and may be auto-oxidised to the 
parent compound but that an equilibrium situation is achieved thus enabling its 
visualisation. It is also possible that initial redox cycling of semiquinone could utilise 
oxygen present in the closed system generating hypoxia and thus stabilising the 
radical species.
As in the case of DT-diaphorase catalysed activation of E09, the presence of a radical 
was dependent on cofactor, E09 and NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase. These 
data have therefore provided the first evidence to show that NADPH :  cytochrome 
P450 reductase can catalyse reduction of E09.
Experiments where spin trap DMPO was included also resulted in detection of a 
methyl radical, identical to that observed for DT-diaphorase metabolism of E09. This 
suggested the generation of an oxygen sensitive metabolite.
ESR experiments have served to confirm the metabolism of E09 catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase as well as providing the first evidence that NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase may also catalyse reduction of this compound. In addition they have 
provided valuable insight into the nature of the reaction, detecting and putitatively 
identifying the radical metabolites which may be involved in the mechanism of E09 
toxicity under aerobic conditions. This will be further discussed in Chapter 5. Some 
authors have reported ESR studies involving incubation of whole cells with various 
compounds (Gutierrez et al,  1986; Butler et al,  1990; Dzielendziak et al,  1990). This 
would be a useful experiment to carry out with E09 as it would indicate whether
66
radicals were generated in a whole cell system containing a variety of enzymes as 
well as mechanisms to protect against free radical damage. Various inhibitors could 
be used together with cells of differing enzyme content.
To conclude, data presented in this chapter have confirmed that E09 can undergo 
reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase derived from both rat and human tumour cells 
and has to some extent elucidated the mechanism of reaction. Results indicated that 
this reduction generates a highly oxygen-sensitive metabolite which, under aerobic 
conditions, is rapidly auto-oxidised to yield the semiquinone radical and ultimately 
the parent quinone. The latter is then available for further reduction. This process of 
redox cycling concomitantly produces potentially damaging oxygen-based radicals. 
Results of ESR experiments have also provided the first evidence that E09 can be 
reduced by NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase. This also generates semiquinone 
and oxygen-based radicals similar to those formed by DT-diaphorase reduction 
although these are likely to result from a direct one-electron reduction process. 
Hypoxia did not affect the initial rate of reduction of the indoloquinones by DT- 
diaphorase but it is likely to affect the stability of metabolites so generated as well as 
of those produced following reduction by other enzymes such as NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase. The nature of the substituent groups have been reported 
to affect the auto-oxidation rate of 1,4-napthoquinones (Brunmark et al,  1988). It is 
therefore possible that analogues of E09 may differ in their stability under oxic 
conditions. Altering pH also had no effect on the rate of DT-diaphorase reduction of 
E09. It may however alter the chemical nature of either E09 itself or of its 
metabolites. For example in the case of the quinone compound AZQ, protonation of 
the aziridine ring may be facilitated upon reduction of the quinone group and acidic 
conditions may encourage the protonation (Mossaba et al,  1985). Thus hypoxic and 
acidic conditions which have been reported to occur in solid tumours may result in a 
different spectrum of metabolites to those produced by the same enzyme reactions 
under aerobic conditions. This may have consequences for the degree of cytotoxicity 
seen in the different environments.
The limited structure-activity relationship studies also reported in this chapter clearly 
showed that structural modification of E09 had major effects on the ability of 
indoloquinones to be metabolised by DT-diaphorase. The information gained from 
such studies may lead to the optimisation of drug structure for enhanced or reduced 
metabolism by DT-diaphorase depending on whether it is found to activate or 
detoxify the indoloquinone anticancer agents. In this regard it is promising that, 
within the limited number of analogues studied here, individual compounds were
67
identified which were either very much poorer or alternatively better substrates for 
DT-diaphorase than E09 itself. In order to demonstrate the cellular consequences of 
a varying ability to act as a substrate for DT-diaphorase it is necessary to investigate 
also the cytotoxicity of the indoloquinones. These studies are described in the 
following chapter.
Chapter 4  
Cytotoxicity of Indoloquinones
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 Cytotoxicity of Indoloquinones
At the outset of the work described in this thesis only limited information was 
available concerning the in vitro  cytotoxicity of E09. Subsequently however, this 
issue has been extensively studied by a number of investigators in a large range of cell 
lines. The effect of hypoxia, pH, exposure time and cell density amongst other factors 
have also been characterised.
In initial experiments, the aerobic cytotoxicity of E09 was determined in vitro  
against cell lines derived from human small cell lung cancer (Roed et al,  1989), rat 
Walker tumour, human colon carcinoma (this thesis published in Bailey et al,  1992; 
Walton et al,  1992a) in addition to leukaemia, colon and breast tumours (Collard et al,  
1992). More extensive analyses followed which documented the sensitivity of larger 
panels of cell lines to E09. These included, in particular, studies carried out by 
Robertson et al  (1992; 1994) of 23 human tumour cell lines (breast, lung and colon) 
as well as 8 rodent lines and those of Plumb and co-workers involving 8 human lung 
cancer cell lines (Plumb et al,  1994a) and 23 cell lines derived from breast, glioma, 
ovary and lung tumours (Plumb et al,  1994b). Similar experiments were conducted 
by Phillips and co-workers (1992) and by Smitskamp-Wilms et al  (1994). In the 
largest survey conducted to date, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 
collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC), has determined the in vitro  aerobic cytotoxicity of E09 in its panel of 56 
human tumour cell lines (reported in Hendriks et al,  1993). These included eight 
different tumour types, namely leukaemic, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung 
cancer, colon cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer in 
addition to the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and P388 murine leukaemia cell 
lines and their multidrug resistant variants. The cytotoxic potency was obtained using 
the sulpharhodamine B (SRB) protein assay with a 48 hour continuous drug exposure. 
In general E09 was found to be highly cytotoxic with a mean GI 50 value (the 
concentration at which 50% growth inhibition occurred) of 17 nM taken from all the
69
lines in the panel. Colon, melanoma and CNS tumour lines exhibited particular 
sensitivity to E09 with GI 50 values generally being 10 nM or below. Similar levels of 
response were also observed in individual cell lines derived from renal and non-small 
cell lung cancer. In this survey (Hendriks et al,  1993) and in other studies referred to 
above it was generally found that cell lines derived from solid tumours tended to be 
more sensitive to E09 than leukaemic cell lines . However, Phillips et al  (1992) did 
not observe such a preference in their investigation. In support of the general in vitro  
trend, some selectivity for solid tumours compared with leukaemias has also been 
noted in in vivo  studies (Hendriks et al,  1993; Walton etal,  1992a).
Experiments carried out with E09 on the small cell lung cancer tumours, OC-tol and 
NCI-N592 (Roed et al,  1989) and mouse colon adenocarcinomas MAC 16 and 26 
(Walton et al,  1992a) in vivo  correlated well with the sensitivity of the equivalent in 
vitro  cell lines. This supports the potential usefulness of these cell lines as an in vitro  
screen for the prediction of antitumour activity.
Under identical conditions to those described for E09, mitomycin C, the prototype 
bioreductive alkylating agent, exhibited a totally different antitumour profile to that of 
E09 when examined in the NCI panel of cell lines. A similar lack of correlation 
between the aerobic cytotoxic potency of mitomycin C and E09 was noted in a range 
of cell lines by Phillips and co-workers (1992) and by Robertson and co-workers 
(1992; 1994) again using a hour continuous exposure time. Mitomycin C was in 
general less potent (mean GI 50 value 71 nM) in the NCI panel, showed no preference 
for any particular tumour type with the exception of melanoma, and was not selective 
for solid tumour versus leukaemic cell lines. In addition, E09 did not exhibit 
differential sensitivity between the CHO-K1 cell line and its mitomycin C resistant 
variant (Stratford and Stephens, 1989). These data would suggest possible differences 
in the mode of drug activation and / or cytotoxicity between E09 and mitomycin C.
A number of experiments have examined the effect of oxygen status on the toxicity of 
E09 (Adams et al,  1992; Hendriks et al,  1993; Plumb and Workman, 1994; Plumb et 
al, 1994a and b; Robertson et al,  1994). These have revealed an enhancement of 
toxicity in some cell lines, but not others, under hypoxic conditions in vitro  with 
hypoxic cytotoxicity ratios as large as 1700 in the case of BE colon carcinoma cells 
(Plumb and Workman, 1994). This is much greater than that observed for other 
bioreductive compounds such as mitomycin C which showed only a 9 fold 
potentiation of toxicity under hypoxia using the BE cell line. A high degree of E09 
sensitivity towards hypoxic cells has also been observed in vivo  with the KHT
70
II
sarcoma (Adams et al , 1992). Interestingly, studies involving the use of the 
vasoactive agent hydralazine have shown an enhancement in sensitivity of MAC 26 
murine colon adenocarcinoma to E09 in vivo  (Bibby et al, 1993). This may be due to 
increased levels of hypoxia induced by the modulation of blood flow with 
hydralazine, although pharmacokinetic effects can not be ruled out.
Data presented in Chapter 3 showed that structural analogues of E09 varied in their 
ability to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase. No publications were 
available regarding the cytotoxic potency of these compounds. Thus experiments 
described in this chapter were designed primarily to investigate whether these 
analogues also varied in their cytotoxic potency and in particular the extent to which 
the structure-activity relationships for DT-diaphorase metabolism versus cytotoxicity 
were related. This in turn allowed initial evaluation of the relationship between 
indoloquinone sensitivity and metabolism by DT-diaphorase.
4.1.2 Chemosensitivity Assays
A number of methods are available for determining the sensitivity of cell lines to 
particular agents. These include clonogenic assays, cell counting following trypan 
blue exclusion, 3H thymidine incorporation, MTT and related tetrazolium dye 
reduction and protein staining assays such as crystal violet amongst others.
These various methods actually measure different parameters. For example, the 
clonogenic assay determines the ability of cells to undergo clonogenic proliferation 
whereas the 3H thymidine incorporation assay measures the number of cells which are 
actively synthesising DNA. Depending on how the tetrazolium dye reduction assays 
are carried out this may measure predominantly either cytotoxicity or cytotstasis, or a 
combination of these. In addition, some compounds, due to their mode of action may 
not be suited to particular assay types. The choice of assay employed will therefore 
depend both on the nature of the compounds under examination as well as the type of 
information required. The chemosensitivity assays employed in this thesis are 
discussed in more detail below.
MTT Assay
A tetrazolium dye-based microtitration assay was first described by Mossman (1983). 
This assay is based on the conversion of a yellow, water soluble monotetrazolium salt 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MTT) to an insoluble
71
purple formazan when reduced. The mitochondrial dehydrogenases are involved in 
MTT reduction via electron transport from NAD or NADP diaphorases and therefore 
active, viable mitochondria are required for this reduction to occur. Thus only living, 
not dead cells are able to reduce MTT (Mossman, 1983).
The MTT assay employed in this thesis is a rapid, semi-automated method by which a 
large number of samples can be easily screened. It has been shown to be highly 
reproducible and in general it correlates well with results obtained by other assays 
(Alley et al,  1988; Carmichael et al,  1987). Unlike some methods it does not require 
the use of radioactivity or expensive equipment. In addition to giving an immediate 
visual qualitative result, quantitative information may also be obtained. This requires 
prior determination of the formazan production for a known cell number. Despite the 
large benefits of the MTT assay there are also a few disadvantages. The procedures 
employed are often unable to distinguish between cytotoxicity and cytostasis. 
Caution must also be taken when dealing with compounds which either reduce MTT 
directly or which may interfere with the reductive systems involved in MTT 
metabolism. A relevant example of this is dicoumarol which has been reported to act 
as an uncoupler of mitochondrial enzymes and inhibit a number of reductive enzymes 
(Wermuth, 1981; Gustafson and Pritsos, 1992b; Hodnick and Sartorelli, 1993; Murray 
et al , 1982). In addition, the quinone compound menadione, following reduction 
catalysed by DT-diaphorase, generated a metabolite which could directly reduce MTT 
(Prochaska and Santamara, 1988). It is important to validate the MTT assay for 
individual cell lines and compounds, and in view of the above comments, this is 
particularly true in the case of quinone-type agents.
The MTT assay was selected as the principal method for determining cytotoxic 
potency in this work as it was commonly employed in our laboratory because it 
provides rapid and easy screening of large numbers of compounds in different cell 
lines.
Crystal Violet Staining
Crystal violet stains protein and may therefore be used to determine cell number. 
This may be quantitative if optical absorbance is determined for known cell densities. 
It must however be noted that if an agent induces an increase in cell size this may be 
misinterpreted as an increase in cell number (a feature which can also apply to the 
tetrazolium dye reduction assays). In addition dead cells may to some extent remain
72
adherent to the substratum leading to further errors. Despite these possible limitations 
the assay was used here solely to confirm the data obtained by MTT assay.
Clonogenic Assay
The clonogenic assay measures the ability of cells to undergo clonogenic proliferation 
and is thus able to distinguish between cytotoxic and cytostatic effects. This method 
is however time consuming and was therefore only employed to provide further data 
on Walker cell sensitivity to E09. It would have been extremely difficult to confirm 
the MTT assay results in the Walker cell line by crystal violet staining due to the fact 
that the cells are grown in suspension culture.
4.2 Methods
4.2.1 MTT Dye Reduction Assay
The cytotoxicity of a number of the indoloquinones was determined by means of the 
MTT dye reduction assay. The method employed was based on that described by 
Mossman (1983). As discussed by Carmichael and co-workers (1987) cells must be 
in an exponential phase of growth when MTT is added and MTT dye reduction should 
be linear with respect to cell number. It was therefore important that the optimum cell 
number and length of assay were determined for each cell line used. As both the 
HT29 and Walker cell lines were routinely used in the MTT assay in our laboratory 
optimum conditions had already been determined by J. Donaldson but were 
reconfirmed in the present work (data not shown). These optimal conditions were 
employed in the experiments detailed in this chapter.
Walker and HT29 cells cultured routinely as described in Chapter 2 were harvested 
for assay during log phase of growth. A single cell suspension was prepared and the 
cell number determined using a haemocytometer. Samples were resuspended in fresh 
medium to give a density of 1  x 10 4 cells / ml for HT29 cells and 5 x 10 3 cells / ml for 
Walker cells. Aliquots (200 jil) of the cell suspension were placed in to each of 88 
wells of a 96 well microtitre plate (Falcon). The initial row of 8 wells was filled with 
200 jl lI of medium alone to act as a blank. Plates were then incubated at 37°C, 8% 
CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere for 4-6 hours to permit recovery of cells from 
mechanical disruption and, in the case of HT29 cells, to allow adhesion to the 
substratum before drug treatment. Compounds were diluted in DMSO (to give a
73
maximum final concentration of 0.05%) and applied to the cells in 20 pi aliquots to 
provide the required range of concentrations. Cells were exposed to drug 
continuously over a nominal period of 72 or 96 hours for Walker and HT29 cells 
respectively under standard incubation conditions. No particular allowance was made 
for any decrease in drug concentration during the period of the assay. At the end of 
the exposure time 20 pi of MTT dye solution (5 mg / ml in sterile PBS) was added to 
each well and the plates returned to incubate for a further 2 hours. This time had been 
determined to be within the linear range of the MTT dye reduction curve for each cell 
line. The medium containing MTT solution was then gently removed from the wells 
by aspiration leaving the reduced tetrazolium salt present as blue crystals in the cells 
adherent to the microtitre plate. As Walker cells grow in suspension culture it was 
necessary to pellet the cells before aspiration. This was carried out by centrifugation 
of the plates at 200g for a period of 5 minutes at 4°C. The tetrazolium salt was then 
solubilised by addition of 200 pi of DMSO to each of the 96 wells of the microtitre 
plate followed by agitation using a plate shaker (10 minutes). Absorbance at 540 nm 
was determined by use of a Titertek Multiscan MCC ELISA plate reader (Flow 
laboratories, Helsinki, Finland) with a reference beam of 690 nm. The medium blank 
was automatically subtracted. Results were expressed in terms of absorbance as a 
percentage of the vehicle control. Each drug concentration was repeated 4-8 times per 
experiment and in general 3 between day repeats were carried out. The results of 
repeat wells within the same experiment were averaged and the data were expressed 
graphically as log of the drug concentration (x axis) plotted against absorbance as a % 
of vehicle control (y axis). The IC 50 (concentration which reduces the absorbance to 
50% of the control wells) was then determined by ,&yt.
In order to investigate the involvement of DT-diaphorase in the cytotoxicity of the 
indoloquinones experiments were carried out where the DT-diaphorase inhibitor 
dicoumarol was included. In general this was dissolved in DMSO (final 
concentration of 0.05%) although experiments were also carried out where 0.05 M 
sodium hydroxide was used as the solvent (giving a final concentration of 227 pM) 
and this was found to give similar results. Dicoumarol was used at the highest non­
toxic concentration which was determined to be in general around 50 pM for HT29 
and 10 pM for Walker cells. In occasional experiments some degree of toxicity was 
apparent at these concentrations and therefore 25 pM dicoumarol for HT29 cells and 
5 pM for Walker cells were also employed. Inhibitor was applied 30 minutes prior to 
addition of the test drug and remained present throughout the exposure period. Due to 
the complications of dicoumarol in the MTT assay described in the Introduction to
74
this chapter the cytotoxic levels of dicoumarol were confirmed by the crystal violet 
assay.
The modulation of cytotoxicity exerted by dicoumarol was expressed as the dose 
modification factor (DMF) determined by the formula:-
DMF = ____________ IC50_______________
IC50 in the presence of dicoumarol
Validation o f MTT Assay for Drugs Used
Literature precedent had indicated the possibility of both quinone compounds 
(Prochaska and Santamaria, 1988) and dicoumarol, by virtue of its inhibition of 
reductive enzymes (Ernster 1987; Wermuth, 1981; Gustafson and Pritsos, 1992b; 
Hodnick and Sartorelli, 1993), interfering with MTT reduction by cells. Hence 
experiments were carried out to determine the extent of this effect. Menadione was 
selected as a representative quinone for these studies.
Quinones
For menadione, HT29 cells were plated out as described for the MTT assay but at 
densities of 1  x 10 4 and 5 x 10 3 cells / ml. Following 96 hours incubation various 
concentrations of menadione ranging from 4 pM - 100 pM were applied to each of 
three identical plates which were then incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. The plates 
were subsequently treated individually as described below:-
1. MTT was added immediately to cells.
2. Medium containing drugs was removed from cells, the plate was 
washed twice to remove residual drug and metabolites and fresh 
medium plus MTT were added.
3. Cells were treated as for plate 2 except that, following washing, 
medium containing fresh drug was added.
The plates were then incubated for a period of 2 hours and optical density of the 
formazan product was determined as described previously.
75
Dicoumarol
Walker cells were plated out at densities of 5 x 10 3 and 10 3 cells / ml and were 
incubated with 0.39 pM-100 (iM dicoumarol for various lengths of time before adding 
MTT and determining the optical density of the formazan product. The times were 
chosen to be insufficient to cause cytotoxicity, thus any effect seen should result from 
a direct influence on MTT formazan development.
4.2.2 Crystal Violet Staining for Determination of Cytotoxicity
Crystal violet is a protein stain which has been used to determine cell number 
(Drysdale et al , 1986). In order to confirm results obtained by the MTT assay, crystal 
violet staining was also carried out on HT29 cells which had been treated under 
identical conditions. Following drug treatment (see Section 4.2.1) medium was 
decanted and an excess of crystal violet solution was applied (200  jul; 0.2% in 2% 
ethanol in distilled water). This was left for 10 minutes prior to removal and thorough 
rinsing in tap water for 2 minutes. Solvent (200 |il ; 0.5% SDS; 50% ethanol in 
distilled water) was then added to each well and the plates returned to the incubator 
for 1  hour at 37°C before agitating for 10 minutes using a plate shaker. Absorbance 
was determined on a plate reader at 610 nm wavelength.
In order to determine whether absorbance of crystal violet remained in the linear 
range, cells were plated out at various densities, incubated for periods of 24, 48, 72 
and 96 hours and the optical density measured with crystal violet as described above.
4.2.3 Clonogenic Assay
Cytotoxicity of the indoloquinones was also determined in both Sensitive and 
Resistant forms of the rat Walker UK 256 tumour cells by clonogenic assay. Cells 
which had been cultured routinely (Chapter 2) were harvested during log phase of 
growth and were diluted to give a cell density of 2 x 10 5 cells / ml. Aliquots (10 ml) 
were taken and placed in 15 ml tubes (Falcon) for drug treatment. Various 
concentrations of the test compounds (in DMSO; maximum final concentration of 
1%) were applied to the cells and the latter incubated under standard conditions for 2 
hours. Control samples were treated with an equivalent amount of solvent. Drug was 
then removed by centrifugation (7 minutes at lOg in a Beckman centrifuge), washing 
twice in medium and resuspension in 10 ml of fresh medium. Serial dilutions were 
made of the cells to give 2 x 105, 2 x 104>  2 x 103, 2 x 102 and 2 x 10 cells / ml and 2
76
I
II
ml aliquots of each of these were mixed with 3 ml of semi-solid agar (0.12% in 
McCoys 5A medium supplemented with glutamine [1 mM] and horse serum [20%]). 
This was carried out in quadruplet for each treatment. Tubes were then placed in ice 
water to allow solidification of the agar prior to incubation under standard conditions 
for a period of -10 days. On reaching a size of over approximately 50 cells, colonies 
were counted using a dissecting microscope. Quadruplet values were averaged and 
results were corrected for the plating efficiency determined from the control. Data 
were expressed as a % survival and were illustrated graphically by plotting log % 
survival against drug concentration.
Clonogenic assays were also carried out including the various concentrations of the 
inhibitor dicoumarol (100 pM - 600 pM) which had previously been determined to be 
sub-cytotoxic over the two hour exposure period employed. This was solubilised in 
DMSO (to give an maximum final concentration of 3%; which had also previously 
been determined to have no effect on the plating efficiency) and was applied 10 
minutes prior to addition of the test compound. Two controls were employed, one 
containing dicoumarol alone and the second vehicle alone.
4.3 Results
4.3.1 Validation and Optimisation of Assay Conditions
Crystal Violet Assay
In addition to reconfirming conditions for the previously optimised MTT assay 
(Section 4.2.1) it was also necessary to determine an optimum cell density for use in 
the crystal violet assay. Fig 4.1 illustrates that a fairly linear relationship exists for 
optical absorbance of crystal violet with increasing cell number over the range 1 x 103  
to 4 x 10 4 cells / ml. Thus the cell density of 1  x 10 4 cells / ml was selected as 
optimum for use in cell survival assays.

As mentioned in Section 4.1 it was possible that dicoumarol as well as quinone 
compounds could have an effect on the MTT assay. The results revealed that, where 
low concentrations of dicoumarol (< 5 pM) were incubated with Walker cells, optical 
density of the formazan was either reduced to a minimal extent (in general < 10%) or

unchanged compared with the control over the 0-2 hour incubation time. In contrast, 
with increasing dicoumarol concentration above 5 jiM, an increase in optical density 
corresponding to enhanced formazan production was observed over time. No effect 
of dicoumarol on the production of formazan was noted in the absence of cells, thus 
indicating that this observation was not due to any direct effect of the compound on 
MTT. Both DMSO and sodium hydroxide were employed as solvents in these 
experiments with little difference being observed between results. In addition 
controls examining the effect of the appropriate amounts of these vehicles revealed 
little / no effect on MTT reduction in the absence of dicoumarol. Despite these 
observed differences in formazan production at higher (>5pM) dicoumarol 
concentrations, IC 50 values obtained using HT29 cells were similar for both the MTT 
dye reduction assay and crystal violet staining (with mean values ± SD of 95 ± 13.23
l*i* A
and 76.67 ± 2.89 respectively). In the one experiment using the Walker cell line A
where the MTT assay was compared with direct cell counting, similar results were 
again obtained (IC 50 values of 33 pM and 30 pM respectively). This would indicate 
that although dicoumarol affects MTT dye reduction in the short term it may not 
significantly alter the IC 50 values obtained over a longer exposure time.
Effect of Quinone Drugs on the MTT Assay
The effect of the quinone menadione on MTT reduction was also examined. Cells 
were incubated with menadione for 30 minutes before either analysing directly with 
MTT or rinsing, replacing with either medium alone or medium containing fresh drug 
and then adding MTT. Reduction of MTT was found to be highest for cells where 
drug had not been rinsed off before incubation with the formazan (95-130% of the 
vehicle control for 2x l03 cells) over the range of menadione concentrations examined 
(4-100 pM). Where cell supernatant had been replaced with fresh medium 
absorbance was lower (48-90% of vehicle control) whereas an intermediate degree of 
MTT reduction was observed for cells where the medium had been replaced with 
medium containing fresh drug (59-119%). Thus, over the 30 minute exposure time 
employed in these assays, menadione did appear to affect the production of formazan 
from MTT. However, the cytotoxicity of menadione determined by the MTT dye 
reduction assay gave almost identical results to those obtained using the crystal violet 
assay. This suggested that, while menadione metabolites may affect MTT dye 
reduction in the short incubation periods used in these validation assays, it may not 
have an important effect over the longer incubation times used for cytotoxicity 
testing.

Determination of Sub-cytotoxic Concentration of Dicoumarol for Inhibition Assays
In order to use dicoumarol to investigate the effect of DT-diaphorase inhibition on the 
toxicity of the quinone compounds it was necessary to determine the highest sub- 
cytotoxic concentration. Concentration-response curves determined by the MTT 
assay are shown in Fig 4.2 for both the rat Walker and human HT29 cell lines. It is 
evident that the Walker cells are far more sensitive to dicoumarol than the HT29 cells 
with mean IC 50 values of 16.8 pM and 90 pM respectively. Little difference was 
observed between the results obtained using sodium hydroxide and DMSO as a 
solvent (data not shown). In general toxic affects were noted in the HT29 cell line at 
concentrations above 50 pM and in the Walker cell line above 5-10 pM. For this 
reason 50 pM and 25 pM dicoumarol were selected as inhibitor concentrations for 
quinone toxicity modulation experiments for HT29 cells and 10 pM and 5 pM for 
Walker cells.
4.3.2 Toxicity of Quinone Compounds
Both the human HT29 colon carcinoma and rat Walker tumour cells were found to be 
relatively sensitive to menadione, the conventional substrate for DT-diaphorase, when 
compared with published data for a number of anticancer agents. Values obtained 
from MTT assays in HT29 cells compare closely with those obtained by crystal violet 
staining; for example the mean IC 50 values for menadione using the MTT and crystal 
violet assay were 15.8 pM ± 5.15 and 10.2 pM ± 2.91 respectively (mean ± SE of a 
minimum of four repeat experiments). These results therefore indicated the validity 
of the MTT method. Interestingly, both cell lines exhibited equal sensitivity to 
menadione with mean IC 50 values as determined by MTT assay of 15.8 pM for HT29 
cells and 13.7 pM for Walker cells (Table 4.1).
The indoloquinone E09 was found to be an extremely potent cytotoxin in both the 
human HT29 and rat Walker tumour cells (Fig 4.3 and Table 4.1). In contrast to 
menadione a marked differential toxicity was observed between the two cell lines, the 
Walker cells being more sensitive to E09 with an IC 50 of 0.047 nM compared with an 
IC50 of 14.8 nM for HT29 cells. As with menadione, results obtained with the MTT 
assay for HT29 cells compared well with those obtained using the crystal violet assay 
(mean IC 50 values ± SE of 14.8 nM ± 0.35 and 10 nM ± 0.22 respectively)
Despite the fairly modest changes in chemical structure, the 9 analogues of E09 
examined were observed to vary to a considerable extent in their cytotoxic potency to

both rat Walker and human HT29 cell lines (Table 4.1). E09 and also EO 88, the 
compound in which one of the hydroxyl leaving groups (in the X 2 position, Chapter 3, 
Fig 3.1) of E09 was substituted with a carbamate group, were the most toxic. In 
striking contrast HT29 cells were far less sensitive to E05A, which had a ring-opened 
aziridine ( 2-hydroxyethyl amino group) in place of the intact ring, than to all other 
analogues examined. The IC 50 value was greater than 327 pM compared with a value 
of 14.8 nM for E09. Other analogues with various substituents were intermediate 
between these two extremes (Table 4.1). In general all compounds which possessed 
the aziridine moieties including E09, EO 8 8, E08 and E072 exhibited greater 
cytotoxicity than those lacking this functional group. Similar to menadione, some 
analogues appeared to exert equal potency towards both rat Walker and human HT29 
tumour cells whereas others showed a differential sensitivity between the two cell 
lines.
Dicoumarol modulation
In general, fairly small differences if any in the toxicity of quinones were seen in the 
presence of dicoumarol. Inclusion of dicoumarol (50 pM) in the toxicity assay for 
menadione resulted in a 1.5 fold decrease of the IC 50 value obtained in HT29 cells 
(Table 4.2, Fig 4.4 a). Thus dicoumarol potentiated menadione toxicity, consistent 
with the view that DT-diaphorase functions to detoxify menadione. The results 
obtained for modulation of indoloquinone cytotoxicity by dicoumarol were fairly 
variable with some difference being observed between data obtained using the crystal 
violet assay and those using the MTT assay (Table 4.2). In general however, little 
alteration in cytotoxicity was observed with E09 (Fig 4.4 b and Table 4.2) or the 
analogues examined in the presence of inhibitor. The main exception being EO20 
which showed a consistent potentiation of cytotoxicity in the presence of dicoumarol 
of 1.2-2 fold. The sensitivity of HT29 cells to E08 was also consistently greater in 
the presence of dicoumarol (Table 4.2). The concentration-response curve for HT29 
cells in the presence of E09 and modulation by dicoumarol are shown in Fig 4.4 b.
Clonogenic Assay
Clonogenic assays examining the effect of E09 on Walker Sensitive and Resistant 
lines confirmed that E09 was an extremely potent cytotoxin (Fig 4.5 a). The IC 50 
values were however higher than those obtained using the MTT assay for the Walker 
Sensitive cell line. Preliminary data with EO 88 revealed a similar cytotoxic potency 
to E09 in both these cell lines (Fig 4.5 a and b).

IIr
A differential in toxicity was demonstrated between the Resistant and Sensitive 
strains of Walker cells in response to E09 (Fig 4.5 a) and EO 88 (Fig 4.5 b) suggesting 
that these compounds may act as bifunctional alkylating agents. Where dicoumarol 
was included in the cell survival assays for E09 (Fig 4.6) and EO 88 (data not shown) 
some protection against cytotoxicity was noted. These results were generally similar 
to those obtained with HT29 cells by the MTT and crystal violet assay.
4.4 Discussion
Having determined in Chapter 3 that E09 was able to undergo metabolism catalysed 
by DT-diaphorase, experiments described in this chapter were designed to elucidate 
whether this may represent an activation or detoxification process. The cytotoxicity 
of E09 was therefore investigated in two cell lines which express high levels of DT- 
diaphorase, namely HT29 human colon carcinoma and Walker rat tumour cells. In 
addition the effect of structural modification on cytotoxicity was also examined, since 
this also represents a means of relating metabolism to cytotoxicity and may 
potentially lead to further improvements over E09.
4.4.1 Validation of Assays
Effect o f Quinones on the MTT Aassay
Because tetrazolium dye assays are based on metabolic reduction, experiments were 
carried out to determine the effect of menadione, as a representative quinone, on MTT 
dye reduction. These revealed some increase in formazan production where 
menadione was present before and during incubation with MTT, suggesting that 
metabolites might facilitate reduction of MTT. This finding is consistent with reports 
that menadione metabolites could directly reduce MTT (Prochaska and Santamaria, 
1988). It is possible that over the 72 or 96 hour period of drug exposure employed in 
the assay such an effect would not occur or would be insignificant. Results obtained 
using the MTT assay for these quinone compounds agree well with data obtained 
using the crystal violet assay. This shows that any interference of quinones with MTT 
dye reduction does not affect the IC 50 value obtained.

Data are taken from an individual experiment and were confirmed in at

three or more repeat assays carried out within the same experiment.
Effect of Dicoumarol on the MTT Assay
Where dicoumarol was applied to Walker cells at low concentrations (<5 pM) a 
decrease in MTT formazan production was observed. This was indicated by a 
decrease in absorbance of this product at 590 nm ranging from 7 - 40 % depending on 
the concentration and exposure time. Surprisingly, however, at higher dicoumarol 
concentrations MTT dye reduction increased both with increasing time of exposure 
and concentration of compound. This implied that dicoumarol interfered with 
enzymes involved in MTT dye reduction. Dicoumarol is known to inhibit DT- 
diaphorase (Ernster, 1987), an enzyme implicated in tetrazolium dye reduction 
(Romyhr, 1987; Schor and Comelisse, 1983), in addition to acting as a mitochondrial 
uncoupler (Murray et al,  1982). This would explain the observed decrease in 
formazan production at low concentrations of dicoumarol. Recent reports by 
Gustafson and Pritsos (1992b) have suggested that dicoumarol may also inhibit the 
enzymes xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase. This results in an increase in 
metabolism of mitomycin C. If MTT were able to act as a substrate for xanthine 
oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase it is possible that a similar effect may occur at 
higher concentrations of dicoumarol. These data would indicate that over a short 
exposure time dicoumarol effects the MTT dye reduction process, presumably by 
virtue of its inhibition of bioreductive enzymes. Whether dicoumarol would exert any 
effect on MTT dye reduction following a 72-96 hour incubation period remains 
unknown. An alternative method for determining cell viability, crystal violet staining, 
did however result in a similar IC50 values. This indicates that any effect is not 
significant. At lower concentrations of dicoumarol the MTT assay sometimes gave 
higher values for cell survival than did the crystal violet assay.
One approach that could be employed to reduce the effect of both quinone metabolites 
and dicoumarol on the MTT assay would be to wash the cells before adding the dye. 
This would however incur greater variability in the assay, particularly for suspension 
cultures. In view of the relatively small effects involved it was decided that this 
precaution was not necessary.
Determination of a Sub-cytotoxic Concentration of Dicoumarol
Sub-cytotoxic concentrations of dicoumarol needed to be established for inhibition 
assays. A decrease in cell survival following exposure to dicoumarol was in general 
evident above 50 pM for the HT29 cell line and thus both 50 pM and 25 pM 
dicoumarol concentrations were selected. Walker cells were far more sensitive to
82
dicoumarol with an IC 50 value of around 16 jiM and cytotoxic effects occurring at 
concentrations above 5 JiM. The reason for this difference is not known.
4.4.2 Quinone Toxicity
Both the rat Walker and human HT29 tumour cell lines were highly sensitive to E09 
with IC 50 values of 0.047 nM and 14.8 nM respectively (Table 4.1). These data are 
consistent with the findings of the NCI in vitro  screening programme where the 
compound was found to be extremely potent towards human solid tumour cell lines in 
general. A GI 50 value (concentration which inhibits 50% of growth) of 10 nM was 
quoted for the HT29 cells in the NCI screen which is similar to the value presented in 
this chapter despite the difference in assay and exposure time. Other authors have 
reported IC 50 values of 62.5 nM (Phillips etal,  1992), 160 nM (Robertson etal,  1994) 
and 33 nM (Van Ark-otte et al,  1994) in this cell line. Extending the exposure time of 
HT29 cells to E09 from 24 to 72 hours has however been found to have little effect 
on cytotoxicity although there was a 10 fold difference in IC 50 values between a 1  
hour and 24 hour incubation period (Van Ark-otte et al,  1994). To date there have 
been no publications reporting the cytotoxicity of E09 in the rat Walker tumour cells.
Structural modification of E09 resulted in very significant alterations in the cytotoxic 
potency (Table 4.1). E09 and EO 88, the analogue in which one of the hydroxyl 
leaving groups of E09 has been replaced by a carbamate group, were observed to be 
the most potent cytotoxins of the 9 analogues investigated in both the HT29 and 
Walker cell lines. Although an absolute IC 50 value was not obtained for EO 88 using 
the MTT assay, data obtained using the clonogenic assay revealed that EO 88 had a 
similar cytotoxic potency to E09 in Walker Sensitive cells. In striking contrast 
E05A, the analogue containing a ring-opened and thereby deactivated aziridine 
group, was at least 22,000 fold less toxic than E09 (Table 4.1). During the course of 
this work Phillips and co-workers (1992) reported similar results where E05A is 84 
fold less toxic to DLD-1 human colon adenocarcinoma cells compared to E09. The 
only structural difference between E09 and E05A involves the aziridine ring. It is 
possible that this may be responsible for the differences in cytotoxicity observed 
either by altering the ability of the compound to a) be metabolised and / or b) to cause 
bifunctional adducts as the activated aziridine is a potent alkylating species. E09 and 
EO88 possess an aziridine ring and were both efficiently metabolised by DT- 
diaphorase (Chapter 3) and acted as potent cytotoxins to HT29 and Walker cells. This 
may indicate the importance of an aziridine ring in catalysing reduction of the 
indoloquinones to a cytotoxic species. However, E07 lacks the aziridine moiety
83
(Chapter 3 Fig 3.1) and yet is also well metabolised by DT-diaphorase (Chapter 3) 
and is a potent cytotoxin. These data therefore provided the first indication that DT- 
diaphorase metabolism may be important for the activation of the indoloquinones. 
Moreover, the results with E07 show that the aziridine moiety is not an essential 
structural requirement for metabolism catalysed by DT-diaphorase. Consistent with 
the idea that cytotoxic potency may result from ability of the aziridine moiety to 
confer alkylating ability is the finding that analogues E08, E072, E09 and E088 all 
possess the aziridine group and exhibit comparatively low IC 50 values. In contrast the 
other 6 analogues examined lacked the aziridine moiety and had higher IC 50 values of 
1-30 pM. Results obtained with E07 suggest that the possession of the aziridine 
moiety may not be totally responsible for cytotoxic effects as this compound lacks the 
aziridine ring but retains a similar potency to the aziridine ring-containing compound 
E08. Thus cytotoxic potency appears to be a combination of both ability to be 
activated by enzymes such as DT-diaphorase and possession of the aziridine ring. 
The latter most probably acts to alkylate critical molecules within the cell and 
facilitates DNA cross-linking. The complication in this analysis is that the aziridine 
will contribute to the ability to act as a substrate for DT-diaphorase and to the ability 
to cross-link DNA.
Structure-activity relationships have been examined for other series of bioreductive 
compounds such as the dinitrobenzamide CB 1954. In a similar manner to E09, 
Knox and co-workers (1988) observed that the aziridine moiety was not necessary for 
metabolism of dinitrophenyl aziridine compounds related to CB 1954 by DT- 
diaphorase. Interestingly the aziridine ring opened derivative of this agent has also 
been found to be far less potent in vivo  than the parent compound (Khan and Ross, 
1969 / 1970) in addition to acting as a very poor substrate for DT-diaphorase (Knox et 
al, 1988). Intact aziridine rings have similarly been reported to be important for 
growth inhibition of the quinone agent AZQ in human leukaemic cell lines (Egorin et 
al, 1985).
As discussed above, data presented in this thesis have shown that HT29 and Walker 
cells which possess high levels of DT-diaphorase are extremely sensitive to E09. In 
addition, structure-activity relationship studies found that analogues better 
metabolised by DT-diaphorase acted as more potent cytotoxins than those which were 
more poorly reduced. These data provide the first strong evidence for the 
involvement of DT-diaphorase in the activation of E09. This hypothesis has been 
further substantiated in studies carried out by other investigators. In a pair of colon 
carcinoma cell lines, HT29 cells which express high levels of DT-diaphorase were
84
found to be 15-30 fold more sensitive to E09 than the BE cell line (Walton et al,  
1992a; Plumb and Workman, 1994) which does not express a functional form of the 
enzyme due to a mutation in the NQOl gene (Traver et al,  1992). In the same study a 
correlation between DT-diaphorase expression and sensitivity to E 09 was also 
observed in vivo  in a pair of mouse colon tumours. Studies on large panels of cell 
lines which cover a variety of tumour types of both human and rodent origin 
continued to show a correlation between aerobic sensitivity to E 09 and DT- 
diaphorase expression (Robertson et al,  1992, 1994; Phillips et al,  1992; Plumb et al,  
1994a and b; Smitskamp-Wilms et al,  1994; Fitzsimmons et al,  1994; Pauli et al,  
1994).
Data presented in this chapter have also given a strong indication that DNA damage 
may be involved in the cytotoxic mechanism of E09. A differential sensitivity was 
observed between rat Walker Sensitive and Resistant cells to both E09 and EO 88, the 
analogue with a modified pendant leaving group. This is a characteristic feature of 
difunctional alkylating agents (Knox etal,  1991).
It may be that data obtained with other cell lines may also aid elucidation of the 
mechanism of cytotoxicity exerted by a particular compound. A 315 fold differential 
in sensitivity was observed with E09 between the rat Walker and human HT29 cell 
lines. However, in contrast to E09, certain quinone compounds such as menadione 
and the indoloquinone analogue E07 exhibited equal cytotoxic potency towards both 
the Walker and HT29 cell lines. It is possible that this observation may result from 
variation in the activating enzymes between the two cell lines which alter their ability 
to metabolise some compounds and not others. Alternatively it may reflect a 
difference in the mechanism of cytotoxicity exerted by the various quinones. 
Menadione is thought to induce cell death by oxidative stress and DNA damage 
following redox cycling (Ngo et al,  1991). If the two cell lines were to possess 
similar levels of relevant activating and protective enzymes, or alternatively the same 
overall balance of these enzymes, a similar sensitivity to menadione would be 
expected. Alternatively, for compounds such as E09, the mechanism of toxicity may 
include alkylation as well as free radical damage and oxidative stress. Walker 
Sensitive cells are known to be particularly sensitive to damage caused by 
bifunctional alkylating agents (Knox et al,  1991). Results obtained in this chapter 
revealed a differential in sensitivity between Walker Sensitive and Resistant strains to 
E09 suggesting that this drug acted as a bifunctional alkylating agent which induced 
DNA interstrand cross-links. For a similar reason, compounds which induce toxicity 
primarily by DNA alkylation may show an enhanced cytotoxic potency in the Walker
85
cells as compared with HT29. Menadione and E07 both lack the aziridine moieties 
which are potent alkylating groups and thus may be less likely to mediate toxicity by 
bifunctional alkylation than would E09 and E08 which possess this group. 
Interestingly the former two compounds are those which exhibit similar cytotoxic 
potency in the HT29 and Walker cell lines and the latter those which do not. This 
would substantiate the theory that where a differential is observed the compound is 
more likely to act as an alkylating agent. If, upon examination of a wider range of 
compounds, this phenomenon were to remain consistent comparison of the HT29 and 
Walker cells in cell survival experiments may provide a useful screen for indication of 
the mechanisms of toxicity.
Some information on the redox potentials of the indoloquinones (E1 ^ ) as determined 
by polarography was available from the EORTC (unpublished data on file). As 
reported in Chapter 3, the order of reduction potential from most to least 
electronegative was E012, E08, E 09-E 088, E07. The order of cytotoxicity was 
from most to least cytotoxic E012, E07, E08, E09-E088. Therefore, although there 
is some weak relationship between the reduction potential and aerobic cytotoxicity the 
correlation is not absolute. As discussed in Chapter 3 however the ease of reduction 
did not correlate well with that predicted by redox potential and the half-wave 
potential values are within a fairly narrow range such that little effect on metabolism 
would be expected. A similar lack of correlation between E ^2 values and in vitro  
cytotoxicity was observed with mitosene compounds related to mitomycin C 
(Malipaard et al,  1992). Thus one-electron reduction potentials determined by 
polarography may not be a very useful measure of ability to undergo reduction 
catalysed by DT-diaphorase or of cytotoxicity. As discussed in a recent review by 
Workman (1994) a long-standing view was that the redox potential of the 
bioreductive drug would determine its efficacy as a hypoxic-cell cytotoxin. Although 
the hypoxic sensitivity of cell lines to E09 has not been evaluated in the work 
presented in this thesis, data obtained under aerobic conditions suggests that factors 
other than redox potential may also be important in determining both ability to be 
reduced and cytotoxic potency.
In addition to ability to undergo reductive activation, a number of other factors will 
affect the cytotoxic potency of the indoloquinone compounds. These may include 
other physicochemical characteristics such as solubility, lipophilicity, cellular uptake 
and efflux, as well as the levels of and relative affinities for and maximum velocities 
of different activating and detoxifying enzymes. Depending on the mechanisms of
86
damage involved, systems for protection against oxidative stress, and various DNA 
repair enzymes will also play a role in determining cellular sensitivity to these agents.
Inclusion of dicoumarol in MTT viability assays of the effect of menadione, the 
classical substrate for DT-diaphorase, resulted in ~ 1.5 fold increase in toxicity (Fig 
4.4 a). Although the degree of modulation is fairly small these data were reproducible 
and are in fact consistent with classical results obtained in hepatocytes at the 
Karolinska laboratory (Thor et al,  1982). The protection conferred by dicoumarol 
would suggest that DT-diaphorase is able to detoxify menadione. The relatively 
modest degree of protection is likely to be due to the ability of the hydroquinone 
formed by DT-diaphorase to generate the semiquinone free radical, by reoxidation or 
comproportionation : disproportionation reactions, before the hydroquinone can be 
eliminated by glucuronide or sulphate conjugation. It is also possible that a higher 
degree concentration of dicoumarol, if it had been tolerated, would have given more 
protection.
In contrast to the result obtained with menadione, E09 showed a 1.4 fold decrease in 
toxicity where 50 fiM dicoumarol was included, whereas at 25 JiM dicoumarol little 
modification was observed. Repeating these experiments using the crystal violet 
assay resulted in an apparent increase in toxicity by dicoumarol. Due to the variation 
between the repeat experiments using crystal violet assays the slightly more consistent 
results obtained with the MTT assay appear more reliable. E08 and E07 also showed 
an approximate 1.5 fold decrease in toxicity where dicoumarol was included. These 
were again compounds which were highly cytotoxic to HT29 cells and were well 
metabolised by DT-diaphorase. Thus although the modification of indoloquinone 
toxicity observed in the presence of dicoumarol was small it was of a similar range to 
that observed with menadione.
Clonogenic assays with Walker Sensitive cells confirmed that dicoumarol caused a 
decrease in the cytotoxicity of E09 but not complete protection (Fig 4.6). 
Dicoumarol could bind to serum protein and it is therefore possible that the lack of 
complete inhibition of cytotoxicity is due to low concentrations of the compound 
being achieved in cells. As the cytotoxicity of the compound CB 1954 was almost 
totally alleviated by these concentrations of dicoumarol (data not shown) this would 
be an unlikely explanation. Thus data obtained using both the MTT assay and 
clonogenic assay are supportive of a role for DT-diaphorase in activation of E09, 
E08 and E07 but the lack of complete protection conferred by dicoumarol against 
their toxicity would suggest the additional involvement of other enzymes. Indeed
data obtained from ESR experiments (see Chapter 3) provided evidence for the 
metabolism of E09 by cytochrome P450 reductase to generate potentially toxic drug 
and oxygen-based radicals. In addition, caution must be taken when interpreting data 
obtained using dicoumarol due to the pleiotropic effects seen with this compound (see 
Chapter 3 and Workman et al,  1989).
Hypoxia may enhance the selectivity of bioreductive drugs towards hypoxic tumours 
(Chapter 1). Although the effect of hypoxia and pH on the cytotoxicity of E09 and 
hypoxia have not been examined in this chapter they have been examined by other 
investigators. Cell survival assays have indicated an enhancement in sensitivity of 
HT29, BE (Plumb and Workman, 1994), V I^ (Stratford and Stephens, 1989), KHT 
(Adams et al,  1992), V79 and CHO (Hendriks et al,  1993) cells towards E09 under 
hypoxia compared with aerobic conditions. The ratio of hypoxic :  oxic sensitivity to 
E09 does however vary greatly between cell lines. Interestingly, recent data have 
shown that whereas the aerobic sensitivity of cells to E09 correlate well with DT- 
diaphorase activity an inverse correlation has been observed for DT-diaphorase 
expression and hypoxic sensitivity (Plumb et al,  1994b; Robertson et al,  1994). Data 
presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis showed no difference in the rate of DT- 
diaphorase metabolism between aerobic and hypoxic conditions as determined by the 
cytochrome c reduction assay. In addition, results of ESR experiments revealed that 
an oxygen-sensitive metabolite is generated following reduction of E09 catalysed by 
DT-diaphorase. Thus it is likely that hypoxia influences the stability of the metabolite 
produced by this reduction process and that this may explain the hypoxic 
enhancement of E09 cytotoxicity observed by other investigators. Hypoxia may also 
affect metabolites generated by enzymes other than DT-diaphorase, particularly as BE 
cells do not possess a functional form of DT-diaphorase and showed an extremely 
large hypoxic cytotoxicity ratio (HCR).
To conclude, data presented in this chapter have shown E09 to act as a highly potent 
toxin to both the rat Walker and human HT29 cell lines which express high levels of 
DT-diaphorase. Studies of structural analogues of E09 found a correlation between 
cytotoxicity and ability to undergo DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction. Thus, taken 
together, these results provide the first strong evidence to suggest the importance of 
DT-diaphorase in activation of indoloquinones. Further support of this involvement 
has been provided by dicoumarol inhibition studies and more recently by data from a 
number of laboratories in which sensitivity of cells have been correlated with their 
levels of DT-diaphorase activity. The lack of complete inhibition of toxicity observed 
with dicoumarol suggests the additional involvement of other enzymes in activation
88
of these compounds. Another good candidate enzyme would be NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase as data presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis have shown that in air it 
also can metabolise E09 to generate similar metabolites to those formed by DT- 
diaphorase. In addition to this important link between DT-diaphorase and 
cytotoxicity, structure-activity relationships have revealed other significant findings. 
They show that small modifications to E09 can profoundly alter the cytotoxic 
potency of the compound, thus indicating a potential for new drug development. 
Areas of the molecule which favour both metabolism and toxicity have been 
highlighted with the aziridine group being of particular importance although not 
absolutely essential. Finally, despite the fact that redox potential is often considered 
to be a determinant of cytotoxicity, these experiments have not shown a direct 
correlation but have emphasised the necessity to examine other parameters such as 
enzymatic reduction. The differential toxicity between the rat Walker Sensitive and 
Resistant cells suggested that the mechanism of E09-induced cytotoxicity may 
involve DNA damage. For this reason experiments described in the following chapter 
examined different forms of DNA damage both in intact cells at pharmacologically 
relevant concentrations and in cell free systems to enable the role of individual 
enzymes to be determined.
89
Chapter 5  
DNA Damage
5.1 Introduction
The chemistry of E09 suggests that its mechanism of cytotoxicity may involve DNA 
damage. As discussed previously (Chapter 3) reduction of E09 could generate the 
semiquinone radical with concomitant formation of oxygen radicals under aerobic 
conditions. Both these species may be potentially damaging to DNA by inducing 
DNA strand breaks. In addition, reduction of E09 may facilitate activation of the 
aziridine ring and / or one or both of the hydroxyl leaving groups (Fig 5.1) to produce 
monofunctional or bifunctional alkylating species which could form adducts with 
DNA. Results of clonogenic assays described in Chapter 4 of this thesis further 
suggested the ability of E09 to induce DNA damage. These studies showed a clear 
differential in cytotoxicity between Walker Sensitive and Resistant cells, a feature 
which is typical of a large number of known bifunctional alkylating agents. 
Therefore, the experiments described in this chapter were designed firstly to examine 
whether DNA damage was evident in cells following exposure to pharmacologically 
relevant concentrations of E09 in order to determine whether this could be a possible 
mechanism of E09-induced cell kill. A second aim was to use of cell free assays, to 
investigate the possible involvement of DT-diaphorase and NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase in induction of this DNA damage. A final objective was to 
characterise the damage at a more molecular level by examination of the sequence 
selectivity of E09 binding to DNA both before and following activation by DT- 
diaphorase.

DNA damage was assessed in intact cells by the technique of alkaline elution using a 
method similar to that described by Kohn and co-workers (1981). The rat Walker 
mammary tumour cell line and two human colon carcinoma cell lines, HT29 and BE, 
were selected for theses studies because the cytotoxicity of E09 and DT-diaphorase 
catalysed metabolism of the drug had been characterised precisely in these cells 
(Chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis and Plumb and Workman, 1994). Utilisation of 
irradiated and unirradiated cells permitted both the DNA strand break and interstrand 
cross-link frequency to be determined. Studies carried out by Plumb and Workman 
(1994) had found a 2-5 fold increase in the cytotoxic potency of E09 in HT29 cells 
and 1000-3000 fold in BE cells under hypoxic compared with oxic conditions. If 
DNA damage were involved in the cytotoxic mechanism of E09 the degree of this 
damage would also be expected to change under hypoxia. For this reason the effect 
of hypoxia on DNA damage was investigated in the HT29 and BE cells.
Alkaline elution data obtained with the high DT-diaphorase expressing cell line HT29 
were compared with those for the BE cell line which does not express a functional 
form of the enzyme. This gave an indication of the role played by DT-diaphorase in 
activation of E09 to a DNA-damaging species. However, in order to clarify the 
involvement of DT-diaphorase and the one-electron reducing enzyme NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase in this activation process, cell free assays were also 
carried out. Two agarose gel electrophoresis methods were employed for this, one to 
examine DNA strand breaks and the other to measure DNA interstrand cross-links. In 
addition the selectivity of E09 binding to DNA was investigated using a Taq 
polymerase gel assay.
The DNA strand break assay was similar to that described by Walton and co-workers 
(1991) and is based on conformational changes of pBR 322 supercoiled plasmid DNA 
when it is subject to strand breaks, resulting in an altered electrophoretic mobility. A 
single strand break converts the supercoiled plasmid to the relaxed, open circular 
conformation (form II), whereas a double strand break produces the linear form (III) 
(Fig 5.2). These three species of DNA were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
Gels were visualised by staining with ethidium bromide and quantified by 
densitometry.

DNA cross-links can be detected by a variety of techniques in a cell free system 
including alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation and fluorescence methods amongst 
others. These techniques do, however, have disadvantages. The agarose gel method 
described by Hartley and co-workers (1991) has the advantage of being highly 
sensitive and requires relatively little DNA and drug. Following treatment, DNA is 
heat denatured at 95°C and cooled on ice to provide the single stranded form. In the 
presence of a cross-link, however, DNA remains double stranded. The double and 
single strands of DNA are resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis due to their 
different electrophoretic mobility. The amount of cross-linking induced can be 
quantified by densitometry.
92
Having examined DNA strand breaks and cross-links, DNA damage was examined at 
a molecular level by determining the sequence selectivity of E09 binding to DNA in 
order to more fully understand the mechanism of action of E09. Selectivity of DNA 
binding has been reported for a number of antitumour agents (Mattes et al,  1986; 
Hartley et al,  1986; Hartley et al,  1991b) and it is possible that this preferential 
binding may be related to their antitumour activity (D'Incalci et al,  1992). An 
understanding of the sequence selectivity may therefore allow design of compounds 
with enhanced binding to specific DNA sequences important in eliciting an 
antitumour response. An example of such rational design is clomesome (2- 
chloroethyl(methylsulphonyl) methanesulphonate) which is currently undergoing 
clinical trial in the UK. This compound is based on the chloroethylnitrosoureas and 
possesses chloroethylating potential, which is thought to be related to antitumour 
activity, but lacks hydroxyethylating or carbamoylating activity which are not 
believed to be important and may contribute to toxicity (Hartley, 1993). Another 
point of interest is that many alkylating agents bind to guanines present in GC 
sequences. The human genome has a rich GC content and these regions exist in some 
oncogenes as well as being common in genes associated with proliferation (Mattes et 
al, 1988). It is possible that the antitumour activity observed may be related to the 
sequence-specific binding exhibited by these compounds, but this issue is 
controversial and remains to be clarified.
The specificity of E09 binding to DNA was examined using the Taq polymerase 
assay described by Ponti and co-workers (1991). This method is based on the ability 
of a thermostable DNA polymerase isolated from Thermus aquaticus  to synthesise 
new strands of DNA in vitro.  In the presence of a lesion the polymerase is unable to 
continue DNA strand elongation and thus the newly synthesised strand of DNA 
becomes truncated at a site corresponding to the adduct. Products are subject to linear 
amplification using the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and are 
analysed on polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Fragment mobility and band thickness 
will relate to the site of adduct formation and the frequency of that lesion 
respectively. The method has been reported to give consistent results to those 
obtained using other procedures (Ponti et al,  1991). In addition it is more sensitive, 
does not require a strand breakage step and can detect lesions at any base. The assay 
has also been suggested to have a potential use for examining sequence selectivity of 
binding in intact cells which have been exposed to drug at pharmacologically relevant 
concentrations (D'incalci et al,  1992)

5.2. Methods
5.2.1 Alkaline Elution
Aerobic DNA Alkaline Filter Elution with Rat Walker UK 256 Tumour Cells
Rat Walker UK 256 tumour cells, cultured as described in Chapter 2, Section 2, were 
harvested on reaching a log phase of growth and were resuspended in fresh medium 
to give a density of 3 x 10 5 cells / ml. Flasks containing 50 ml of these cells were 
then radiolabelled with either 3H (plus 0.48 jig / ml of cold thymidine) or 14C at a 
specific activity of 1  pCi / ml. Following a 24 hour incubation period at 37°C, 
radiolabelled cells were pelleted by centrifugation (Beckman TJ 6) at 150 g for 7 
minutes in 25 ml Falcon tubes. Medium was decanted and cells were washed twice in 
PBS before resuspending to a cell density of 2 x 10 5 cells / ml. Aliquots of 10 ml of 
these Walker cells were then transferred to 15 ml tubes (Falcon) for drug treatment.
Alkaline elution experiments generally involve exposing cells to a single dose of drug 
for a set period of time. In the case of the Walker cells a range of conditions were 
investigated before finally optimising the doses to favour detection of cross-links. 
Drug concentrations which had previously been found to be cytotoxic in clonogenic 
assay (Chapter 4) were employed. Initially cells were incubated for a period of two 
hours with E09 at a final concentration of either 80 nM or 400 nM (dissolved in a 
maximum final concentration of 0.1% DMSO). Following treatment half of the cells 
were harvested for immediate examination of DNA damage and the remaining half 
were resuspended in fresh medium and returned to the incubator for a further 24 hour 
period to allow DNA repair. In a second experiment a final concentration of 10 nM 
E09 was applied to cells for varying continuous exposure times ( 2, 4, 7.25, 12, 18 
and 24 hours) before elution. In order to further optimise conditions the amount of 
E09 was increased to 20 nM for continuous exposures of 2, 6 or 20 hours. In a final 
experiment four repeat doses of either 4 nM or 20 nM (dissolved in a maximum final 
concentration of 0.02% DMSO) E09 were applied to cells at four hourly intervals. 
Following a further 12 hour incubation period drug was removed by centrifugation (7 
minutes at 150 g) and cells were washed twice in medium. Half of the cells were then 
taken, resuspended in 10 ml of medium and returned to the incubator at 37°C for a 
further 24 hours in order to examine DNA repair. The remaining cells were prepared 
for elution as described later in this Section. Control incubations involved exposing 
cells to the solvent DMSO at the same concentration as that applied to treated cells. 
The dinitrophenyl aziridine compound CB 1954 has been shown to induce a high
94
frequency of DNA interstrand cross-links in Walker cell DNA using alkaline elution 
(Knox et al,  1991). For this reason CB 1954 treated cells were included in the 
experiment as positive controls. These had been treated with a single dose of 
compound at a final concentration of 10 |iM for a period of 1.5 hours before elution.
DNA Alkaline Filter Elution with HT29 and BE Tumour Cells
HT29 and BE cells were routinely cultured as described in Chapter 2, Section 2. On 
reaching log phase of growth these were harvested by trypsinisation, washed, 
resuspended in medium and seeded at a density of 10 6 cells in 75 cm 2 tissue culture 
flasks. Cells were left for a period of 6-12 hours to permit adherence to the 
substratum before addition of radiolabel. Labelling was carried out as described 
previously in this Section but for a period of 72 hours. Following removal of the 
radiolabel, cells were resuspended in medium, seeded on to sterile, glass petri dishes 
(5 cm diameter) at a density of 1  x 10 6 cells / dish and incubated at 37°C for a chase 
period of 24 hours. This allowed adherence of cells and ensured incorporation of 
label into high molecular weight DNA. Cultures were then treated with E09 or 
vehicle (DMSO in PBS) as a control.
As experiments with Walker cells (detailed above) had been able to detect cross-links 
following multiple additions of drug at four hourly intervals, initial studies with HT29 
and BE cells adopted a similar procedure. Cells were exposed under aerobic 
conditions, to three repeat aliquots of 20 nM E09 (dissolved in DMSO to give a final 
concentration of 0.0 2%) at four hourly intervals followed by a further incubation 
period before eluting 24 hours after the first addition of drug. In a second experiment 
the concentration was further increased to 100 nM but this was applied in a single 
dose for a 20 hour continuous incubation period. Finally, for experiments where 
hypoxic conditions were compared with aerobic ones a short incubation period was 
required. Concentrations of 0.25 pM E09 and 10 |iM E09 were therefore selected as 
these had been previously shown to be around the IC 50 values of E09 in HT29 and 
BE cells respectively for a 3 hour exposure under aerobic conditions (Plumb and 
Workman, 1994). Incubations were carried out within a plastic cake box adapted to 
include two tubes which acted as an inlet and outlet for the appropriate gas. Before 
entering the box, gas was passed through a dreshall bottle containing sterile, distilled, 
deionised water incubated at ~39°C. A pregassing period of 30 minutes allowed the 
water to become saturated with nitrogen and acted to humidify the gas so reducing 
evaporation of the incubation medium. Tissue culture medium was removed from the 
petri dishes and was replaced by 2 ml of sample in PBS which had previously been
95
gassed for a period of 20 minutes with either nitrogen or air/C02 for hypoxic and 
aerobic experiments respectively. Petri dishes were rapidly placed in the box which 
was then tightly sealed with tape and connected to the gas supply. For hypoxic 
incubations nitrogen was used (British Oxygen Company) and for aerobic incubations 
5 % CO 2 in air was employed. Incubations were carried out for a period of 2 hours at 
37°C in the warm room before rapidly removing medium using a Pasteur pipette. The 
cells were then trypsinised and treated as described below.
Preparation of Cells for Alkaline Elution Following Treatment
Harvested cells were counted on a haemocytometer and were resuspended in ice cold, 
sterile PBS to give a final concentration of 1  x 10 6 cells / ml in 15 ml tubes (Falcon). 
These were kept on ice to prevent DNA repair. Samples were divided to provide cells 
for irradiation and those to remain unirradiated to allow the examination of both 
interstrand cross-links and strand breaks. The l4C labelled, treated samples for 
irradiation were given a dose of 6 Gy. A 0.2 ml aliquot of treated cell suspension was 
mixed with 10 ml of ice cold PBS in a 15 ml tube to give a final cell concentration of 
2 x 10 4 cells / ml. In order to compensate for any difference in elution rate between(u K v c W  hood nor o£fi.o \r<LO^oa  W k|k  c*rvyp
columns of the apparatus an internal standard of 3H labelled cells ^jvas employed, 
these were exposed to 1.5 Gy. Where internal standard was included, 0.1 ml of 3H 
labelled cells were added to 0.1 ml of 14C labelled cells in 10 ml of ice cold PBS 
again resulting in a concentration of 2 x 10 4 cells / ml. Similar dilutions were made 
for unirradiated cells to examine DNA strand break formation. Samples were then 
maintained in the dark on ice until they were eluted as described below.
Alkaline Elution Procedure
The elution apparatus consisted of a Swinnex type 50 ml syringe barrel and Swinnex 
filter holder mounted vertically in groups of eight channels per apparatus. DNA was 
eluted through a polycarbonate filter of 2 pm pore size (25 mm diameter, Nucleopore, 
High Wycombe, Bucks., UK.), placed on the filter holder. Elution rate was regulated 
using an 8 channel peristaltic pump (Miniplus 2, Gilson, Anachem, Luton, Beds., 
UK) fitted with 0.38 mm internal diameter PVC miniplus 3 tubing (Anachem). The 
latter was attached to the filter holder via a stainless steel needle. Fractions were 
collected in 6.5 ml scintillation vials (Packard Instrument Co., Gronigen, 
Netherlands) using an LKB Ultrorac II fraction collector (LKB Instruments Ltd, 
Selsdon, Surrey, UK).
96
Before sample elution the polycarbonate filters were moistened with distilled water, 
placed over the filter holder grid, overlaid with rubber O rings to form a tight seal and 
holders were screwed into the Swinnex barrels. Correct functioning of the equipment 
was checked by addition of 5 ml of ice cold PBS to each channel. Cell samples(5 ml) 
were then gently loaded on to the filters and permitted to flow through by gravity 
leaving a total of 10 5 cells deposited on each filter. In all cases samples and solutions 
were added gently in order to avoid introduction of air bubbles and disruption of the 
DNA. All procedures were carried out in the dark and with the apparatus covered 
during elution in order to avoid degradation of naked DNA by UV light. Lysis 
solution (5 ml: glycine [0.2 M; pH 10]; Na2EDTA [0.05 M; pH 9.7]; SDS [0.07 M]) 
containing 0.5 mg / ml of proteinase K was added to each channel. The latter 
constituent digested and removed protein thus allowing measurement of DNA-DNA 
interstrand cross-links without interference caused by DNA-protein cross-links. This 
was followed by 5 ml of lysis solution and 5 ml of wash (Na2EDTA 2H20  [20 mM], 
tetraethylammoniumhydroxide [0.4 % w/v; pH 9]) which served to remove the high 
salt concentration and detergent. When all of the wash solution had passed through 
the columns they were connected to the pump tubing and 10 ml of elution solution 
(Na2EDTA 2H20  [20 mM], tetraethylammoniumhydroxide [7.5 % w/v; pH 12]) was 
added. The high pH of the elution solution disrupts hydrogen bonds between parallel 
strands of DNA converting them to single strands and permitting them to pass 
through the filter. Samples were eluted overnight in the dark at room temperature 
using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1  ml / 90 minutes and 10 x 1  ml fractions 
were collected over 15 hours.
Having completed the elution procedure the filters were gently removed from their 
holders using a pair of blunt tweezers and were placed in scintillation vials. The 
solvent, Soluene 350 (1 ml; Packard Instrument Co.) was added to each of the 
samples which were then placed in a Grant heater (Grant, Cambridge, UK) at 50°C 
for 20-30 minutes before vortexing for a short time to ensure complete solubilisation 
of the filters. To both the eluted fractions and solubilised filters 4 ml of the liquid 
scintillation cocktail, Hionic-Fluor (Packard Instrument Co.) was added and mixed 
thoroughly. The radioactivity (1 4C and 3H content) of the samples was determined 
using a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter (Pharmacia Ltd., St Albans, Herts., U K ).
Calculations and Presentation o f Data
The data obtained from alkaline elution experiments are conventionally displayed 
graphically as an elution profile where the fraction of 3H DNA remaining on the filter
97
(y-axis) is plotted against the fraction of 14C DNA remaining on the filter (x-axis). 
These values are obtained by use of the following equation.
F(i) = T - (Afm 
T
Where F is the fraction of DNA retained on the filter, T is the total number of counts 
per channel (those eluted plus those remaining on the filter) and A is the sum of the 
counts eluted from the first fraction up to and including fraction i.
The rate at which DNA is eluted from the filter is represented by the slope of the 
elution profile. Where DNA strand breaks are present the DNA will elute more 
rapidly than the control unirradiated DNA whereas the presence of DNA interstrand 
cross-links will cause a decrease in the rate of elution compared with the control.
The DNA damage induced was quantified with the application of published formulae 
(O'Connor and Kohn, 1990). This may be expressed as either damage occurring per 
109 daltons of DNA or in rad equivalents. For compounds which induce both DNA 
strand breaks and DNA interstrand cross-links the situation becomes more complex as 
cross-linked DNA which has also received strand breaks will elute more rapidly than 
in the absence of DNA strand breaks and therefore the extent of DNA cross-linking is 
masked. Inclusion of unirradiated samples permits calculation of the DNA strand 
break frequency. This value may be used to correct the calculated DNA cross-link 
frequencies.
DNA Strand Break Frequency
Calculations to quantify the DNA damage frequencies are carried out using only one, 
arbitrarily selected, value for the fraction of DNA retained on the filter. The value 
selected is the retention of the 1 4 C label where that of the internal standard ( 3H) is 0.5. 
This value is known as the "relative retention" and is denoted as Ro and ro for the 
irradiated and unirradiated controls and R1 and rl for the irradiated and unirradiated, 
drug treated samples respectively.
98
The apparent drug induced probability of a strand break (PBD) is calculated using the 
following formula.
PBD = PBR flog trl / ro)
(log (Ro / ro)
PBR is the probability of a single strand break produced by the X-ray dose alone. 
This value for 6 Gy is 5.3 (Roberts and Friedlos, 1987).
5.2.2 Plasmid Strand Break Assay
Aerobic Incubations o f pBR 322 with Purified DT-diaphorase Activating System
Plasmid pBR 322 DNA (Boeringer Manheim UK Ltd., Lewis, East Sussex, UK) was 
supplied in the supercoiled form although some batches contained a small percentage 
of linearised DNA. The extent of contamination was determined by running a control 
lane of untreated plasmid on each gel. Assay conditions were based on those 
described by Walton and co-workers (1991) and were similar to those employed in 
enzymatic assays (Chapter 3, Section 2.1). Reactions were carried out in a 1  ml 
Ependorff tube and standard conditions included: pBR 322 supercoiled DNA (1.6 
jig), E09 (100 JiM), purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (2 jug) and bovine serum 
albumin (0.14%) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 to give a total reaction 
volume of 100 jil. Initial experiments used Tris-Cl (50 mM; pH 7.5) buffer but as a 
result of the high background damage this was substituted by sodium phosphate. The 
reaction was initiated by addition of the cofactor NADH (2 mM) and pulse spinning 
briefly using a microfuge to bring reaction components together. Incubation was 
carried out in a warm room at 37°C for 30 minutes although initial experiments had a 
one hour incubation period. The reaction mixture was agitated at frequent intervals 
during the experiment to ensure complete aeration. In order to stop the reaction 20 jil 
aliquots were taken and added to 5 jil of stop buffer (SDS [0.5%], EDTA [5 mM], 
glycerol [60% v/v] and bromophenol blue [0.001%]). Samples were gently mixed, 
briefly microfuged and kept on ice before loading on to a 1% agarose gel. Assays 
were also carried out where concentrations of DT-diaphorase (0.002, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 4, 8 
and 12 jig), E09 (0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 200 JiM) and incubation time (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 
45 and 60 minutes) were varied. Control incubations involved omitting individual 
components or adding either prior boiled enzyme or dicoumarol (100 JiM in DMSO). 
In order to identify the species responsible for the DNA damage observed, superoxide 
dismutase (300U) and catalase (300U) were included in some assays.

Aerobic Incubations o f pBR 322 with Purified NADPH: cytochrome P450 Reductase  
Activating System
NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase incubations were carried out under almost 
identical conditions to those described for DT-diaphorase assays previously in this 
Section. Standard reaction conditions included E09 (100 pM), pBR 322 (1 pg), 
purified rat NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (0.1 jig), NADPH (2 mM) in 100 
mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 made up to a total reaction volume of 60 j l lI. 
The effect of varying the concentrations of NADPHrcytochrome P450 reductase (0, 
0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 1  pg), E09 (1, 50, 100, 200 and 400 j l iM) and incubation 
time (0, 5, 10, 20, 30,45, 60, 90 minutes) was also investigated.
Hypoxic Plasmid Strand Break Assays
Hypoxic incubations were again almost identical to those carried out in air. The 
apparatus employed to obtain hypoxia consisted of a metal 'pig' attached to a nitrogen 
cylinder (0 grade with < 5 ppm O 2; British Oxygen Co.) via an oxygen trap 
(Oxytrap). The latter acted to remove any trace contamination of oxygen. Reactions 
were carried out in sealed 1  ml glass HPLC vials. Plastic was avoided due to possible 
absorption of oxygen on to the surface. Syringe needles connected the multiple 
outlets of the pig with the reaction vials. A second syringe needle perforated the seals 
of each tube to permit removal of gas. Samples were pregassed with nitrogen for a 
period of 10 minutes before initiation of the reaction by injection of pregassed 
NADH. In order to confirm that this period of time was sufficient to remove a 
significant amount of oxygen comparisons were made with samples gassed for 30 
minutes. An optimum time for gassing was required which permitted removal of 
oxygen without significant evaporation occurring. Reactions were terminated by 
removing 20 pi aliquots of the reaction mixture using a Hamilton syringe and mixing 
with 5 pi of stop buffer.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Samples were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The three possible forms of 
plasmid present supercoiled, open circular and linear have different mobilities when 
electrophoresed and therefore run as distinct bands on an agarose gel. The latter was 
prepared by making a 1% (w/v) agarose solution in TAE buffer (Tris base [40 mM], 
glacial acetic acid [20 mM] and EDTA [1 mM]; pH 8.1). This was placed in a 
microwave oven and heated for 5 minutes on medium power to ensure solubilisation
100
of the agarose before pouring into the gel tank with a 15 well comb. On solidification 
of the gel TAE running buffer was added to the tank and the comb removed. Samples 
and lambda hind III restriction fragments (Gibco BRL Life Sciences, Paisley, 
Scotland, UK) were mixed with loading buffer and were loaded on to the gel. 
Electrophoresis was carried out overnight at 40 volts for 14-16 hours.
The gel was examined by staining with ethidium bromide in TAE (2 jig/ml for 1
hour), rinsing in TAE and viewing under a UV transilluminator. A record of the gel
was taken in both positive and negative form using polaroid type 55 film and a
P olaroid cam era fitted above the transillum inator. On rem oval o f the film  the
negative was washed for 5 minutes in a solution of sodium sulphite and rinsed for a
further 5 minutes in distilled water before drying. The density of bands was a
quantified using^laser densitometer. Due to differential binding capacity of ethidium 
bromide with supercoiled plasmid compared with open circular and linear forms a 
standard correction factor was applied. This involved multiplying density values for 
the supercoiled form by 1.22 (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a).
5.2.3 Plasmid Cross-linking Assay
Cutting and Labelling Plasmid
Plasmid pBR 322 DNA (20 pg) (Northumbria Biologicals Limited, Cramlington, 
Northumbria, UK) was linearised by digesting with 3 p,l of the restriction 
endonuclease Bam HI (Gibco BRL) and 17 pi of lOx reaction buffer 3 (Gibco BRL) 
made up to 170 j l lI in distilled deionised water at 37°C for 1  hour. The reaction was 
terminated by precipitation of DNA by addition of 1/10th volume of sodium acetate 
(7 M) and 3 volumes of 95% cold ethanol, mixing thoroughly, chilling for 10 minutes 
in a dry ice / ethanol bath and centrifugation at 150 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant 
was carefully removed and the DNA pellet dried by lyophilisation (10-15 minutes, 
Edwards freeze drier). Following resuspension in TE (Triethanolamine [25 mM] and 
EDTA [1 mM]) buffer, linearised DNA was then dephosphorylated by incubation at 
65°C for 1  hour with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (62.5 Units; Gibco BRL) and 20 
pi of 5x bacterial alkaline phosphate buffer (to give final concentrations of: Tris-HCl 
[50 mM; pH 8.0] and NaCl [600 mM]) made up to a total volume of 100 pi in 
distilled deionised water. A phenol and chloroform wash was used to extract the 
dephosphorylated DNA. An equal volume of phenol was added, mixed thoroughly 
and the sample briefly centrifuged. The aqueous layer then removed and added to a 
mixture of isoamyl alcohol and chloroform, mixed thoroughly, centrifuged and the
101
water layer again removed. A second chloroform / isoamyl alcohol wash was carried 
out. The DNA present in the water layer was precipitated with alcohol, pelleted by 
centrifugation and the supernatant removed. It was then dried by lyophilisation (5-10 
minutes). Finally the DNA was resuspended in distilled deionised water to give a 
final concentration of 0.5 jL L g /|o .l. Linearisation was confirmed by agarose gel 
electrophoresis (Section 5.2.2).
Having been linearised and dephosphorylated the plasmid DNA was 3' end labelled 
with [y- 32P] ATP (5000 Ci/m mol, Amersham International, Amersham, Bucks, UK). 
This involved incubation of 5 (ig DNA (prepared as described above), 5x forward 
buffer (to give a final concentration o f : Tris-HCl [70 mM; pH 7.6], MgCl 2 [10 mM], 
DTT [5 mM]) supplied in the labelling kit (20 % v/v), [y- 32P] ATP (10 |iCi) and T4 
polynucleotide kinase (5U units) in distilled deionised water at 37°C for 30 minutes. 
Unincorporated ATP was them removed by precipitating the DNA with 1/10 th 
volume of ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of 95% ethanol (as described above), 
removing the supernatant and drying by lyophilisation for 5 minutes. DNA was 
resuspended in 50 j l lI of distilled, deionised water and was precipitated with 1/10th of 
the volume of sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol as described above. The dried 
pellet was resuspended in distilled deionised water to give a final concentration of 
100 ng/jLil and was maintained frozen at -20°C until required.
Aerobic Incubations of Plasmid DNA with Purified DT-diaphorase Activating System.
Approximately 10 ng of end-labelled DNA was incubated with E09 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 
and 100 |iM final concentration), purified rat Walker cell DT-diaphorase (0.0175, 
0.175, 1.75, 17.5 and 175 ng) and 100 j l iM NADH in TE buffer. Control experiments 
involved omission of either drug, cofactor or enzyme as well as a sample of untreated 
DNA. Reactions were carried out for 2 hours at 37°C before termination by addition 
of an equal volume of stop solution (sodium acetate [0.6 M], EDTA [20 mM], tRNA 
[100 |ig/ml]). Cold ethanol 95% (3 volumes) was then used to precipitate DNA as 
described above. The DNA pellets obtained were dried by lyophilisation 
(approximately 15 minutes) and were resuspended in 10 pi of strand separation buffer 
(DMSO [30%], EDTA [1 mM], bromophenol blue [0.04%], xylene cylanol [0.04%]). 
Samples were then denatured at 95°C for 2 minutes and chilled immediately in an ice- 
water bath before loading on to an agarose gel for electrophoresis. One sample, the 
undenatured control was resuspended in 10 (xl loading buffer (sucrose [ 6%], 
bromophenol blue [0.04%]) in place of strand separation buffer and was not heated.
102
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Samples were loaded on to a 0.8 % agarose gel and electrophoresed in TAE buffer at 
40V for 16 hours. The gel was removed and dried on to a sheet of 3 MM Whattman 
filter paper covering a layer of DE81  filter paper at 80°C for 2 hours using a gel drier 
(Bio-rad model 583). Bands were visualised by autoradiography with a hyperfilm 
MP (Amersham) film, exposed for approximately 4 hours using an intensifying 
screen (DuPont-Cronex Lightening-plus intensifying screen).
5.2.4 Taq DNA Polymerase Assay
Preparation of DNA
pBR322 DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme Bam HI and 
dephosphorylated as described in Section 5.2.3.
Drug Treatment of DNA
Bam HI digested pBR322 was incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in the presence of E09 
(0.1, 1, 10 and 100 pM in DMSO at 1% final DMSO concentration), 1  mM NADH 
and purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (0.175 pg) in TEA buffer pH 7.2 to give a 
final volume of 50 pi. Control reactions involved omission of one or more of the 
reaction constituents. In addition a positive control, chlorambucil (100 pM in DMSO 
1% final concentration), was included.
Following drug treatment the reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume 
(50 pi) of stop buffer (sodium acetate [0.6 M], EDTA [20 mM], tRNA [100 pg/ml]) 
and DNA was precipitated with three volumes of ethanol (300 pi) as described in 
Section 5.2.3. The supernatant was then gently removed using a Pasteur pipette and 
the remaining pellet vacuum dried (at least 10 minutes, Edwards Freeze drier). 
Finally the pellet was resuspended in 50 pi of TE buffer.
DNA Amplification
A sy n th etic o lig o n u cleo tid e prim er w ith the sequence 5' 
TATGCGACTCCTGCATTAGG 3' was employed. This was selected as it provides a 
relatively GC rich fragment of desirable strand length for optimal resolution. The 
primer was 5'- end labelled by incubation for 1  hour at 37°C with 20% (V/V) 5x
103
forward buffer (to give a final concentration of :  Tris-HCl [70 mM; pH 7.6], MgCl 2  
[10 mM], DTT [5 mM]), [y-^P] ATP (10 p,Ci), 4% V/V T4 Kinase in a total volume 
of 25 pi of distilled water. This was then passed through spin columns to remove 
unincorporated label. The drug treated DNA samples were mixed with 2.5 mM dNTP 
mix, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% gelatin, labelled primer (5%), 1U Taq polymerase (all 
from Advanced Biotechnologies, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) in buffer and were 
amplified using a Perkin Elmer Cetus PCR machine (30 cycles consisting of 1  minute 
denaturation at 94°C, 2 minutes annealing 60°C, 2 minutes chain elongation at 72°C).
Following linear amplification the samples were transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf 
tube and the DNA precipitated and dried by addition of 1/10 volume of sodium 
acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol as described previously (Section 5.2.3). Finally the 
DNA pellet was resuspended in 3 pi formamide loading dye (98% formamide [98%], 
EDTA [10 mM; pH 8.0], bromophenol blue [0.025%], xylene cyanol [0.025%]), 
denatured by heating for 2 minutes at 90°C, cooled in an ice water bath and loaded on 
to a 6% polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis.
Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
The principal employed was similar to that described in Chapter 2 for Western 
blotting. The Bio-rad sequencing gel kit was assembled and 5 ml of the 6% 
polyacrylamide gel was poured in to the base of the casting tray to seal the apparatus. 
A 6% gel was then poured and left to set before addition of TBE buffer (Tris base, [90 
mM], boric acid [90 mM] and EDTA pH 8.3 [20 mM]) and prewarming at 55°C for 3 
hours. Following loading of samples electrophoresis was carried out at 3000V for 3 
hours. The gel was dried and an autoradiogram developed as described for agarose 
gels in Section 5.2.3.
5.3 Results
5.3.1 Alkaline Elution
DNA Damage in Walker Cells
With the purpose of obtaining optimal conditions for the detection of cross-links, a 
variety of drug concentrations were investigated. Initial experiments utilised 80 nM 
and 400 nM E09 applied to cells for a period of 2 hours with elution being carried out
104
either immediately or after a 24 hour recovery period. Under these particular 
conditions a significant amount of DNA strand breaks were indicated by the more 
rapid elution of treated samples as compared to the control. No DNA cross-links 
were clearly evident although the biphasic appearance of the curve suggested that 
they may be present but masked by DNA strand breaks. When applied to Walker 
tumour cells the positive control CB 1954 showed a high DNA interstrand cross-link 
frequency of approximately 3.18 cross-links / 10 9 daltons of DNA.
In order to optimise conditions for detection of cross-links with E09, varying 
exposure regimes were adopted. Cells subjected to continuous exposure of 10 nM 
E09 were examined at various incubation times (2-12 hours). DNA cross-links 
which increased in extent over time were detected in these experiments but their 
frequency was still fairly low, with a maximum of 0.18 cross-links / 10 9 daltons DNA 
present at 18 hours drug incubation when compared with that of CB 1954 which gave 
a cross-link frequency of 2.88 cross-links / 10 9 daltons of DNA. A further change 
was therefore made where 20 nM E09 was applied continuously over 2-20 hours. 
Unirradiated cells were also employed to permit determination of DNA strand break 
frequency and to correct for this occurrence when calculating DNA cross-link 
frequency. For the shorter exposure times DNA strand breaks were significant with 
no cross-links being apparent (Fig 5.3). After 20 hours treatment a small quantity of 
DNA cross-links were detectable but the amount of DNA strand breaks were less than 
observed with the short exposure times (Fig 5.3). In a final attempt to detect DNA 
cross-links either 4 nM or 20 nM E09 was added to cells on four occasions at four 
hour intervals. This resulted in an enhancement in the DNA cross-link frequency 
detected (Fig 5.4). With repeat doses of 20 nM E09 the cross-link frequency, 
following correction for DNA strand breaks, was 1.14 links / 10 9 daltons of DNA and 
for 4 nM E09 the frequency was 0.658 cross-links / 10 9 daltons of DNA for samples 
eluted 12 hours after initial addition of drug. Repeat assays carried out within the 
same day were found to be highly reproducible.
DNA Damage in HT29 Cells
In attempt to optimise the drug exposure conditions for alkaline elution of HT29 cells 
a variety of drug concentrations were investigated. Initial experiments used 3 repeat 
doses of 20 nM E09 at four hourly intervals followed by a further incubation period 
before harvesting cells 24 hours after the addition of the first aliquot of E09. This 
resulted in a DNA cross-link frequency, when corrected for DNA strand breaks, of 
0.45 links / 10 9 daltons of DNA. E09 concentration was then increased to 100 nM

5.4 Alkaline elution profiles for rat Walker tumour cells exposed to four 
repeat doses of 4 or 20 nm E09 given at four hourly intervals under 
aerobic conditions, (a) shows data obtained using unirradiated cells and 
(b) results seen with irradiated cells. CB 1954 was also included as a 
positive control due to its known ability to induce DNA interstrand cross­
links in this system. Data were taken from an individual experiment and 
were typical of the trend seen in other similar experiments during 
optimisation of the protocol.
given as a single dose over a 20 hour continuous exposure time. This resulted in a 
slight further increase in DNA interstrand cross-link frequency (data not shown). 
Finally conditions were optimised to allow DNA cross-links to be visualised 
following only a 2 hour drug exposure which was necessary to permit comparison of 
aerobic and hypoxic conditions. In these experiments HT29 cells were exposed, 
under aerobic conditions to 0.25 pM E09, a concentration shown to be around the 
IC50 value for HT29 cells by clonogenic assay (Plumb and Workman, 1994). Results 
presented in Fig 5.5 a show that DNA damage was evident as detected by alkaline 
filter elution. The unirradiated, treated sample eluted more rapidly than the respective 
control, as indicated by a steeper elution curve. This is characteristic of the presence 
of DNA strand breaks. Calculations show that the average DNA strand break 
frequency taken from a number of experiments is 4.62 DNA strand breaks / 10 9 
daltons DNA. A possibility of DNA cross-link formation was also indicated from the 
elution profile of irradiated samples. However, on calculation of the DNA cross-link 
frequencies it became evident that none were present. Although no DNA interstrand 
cross-links were evident from initial calculations some of these lesions were detected 
when correcting for the DNA strand breaks thus indicating that the extensive DNA 
strand breaks masked cross-link detection by increasing the flow of linked DNA 
fragments through the filter. Correcting for this effect revealed a small incidence of 
cross-links 0.59 lesions / 10 9 daltons DNA.
The amount of E09 to which HT29 cells were exposed was increased to 10 pM. This 
concentration was previously found to be around the IC 50 value for E09 with BE 
cells following a three hour exposure under aerobic conditions (Plumb and Workman, 
1994). In contrast to results obtained with BE cells (see below) this resulted in little 
further increase in DNA damage above that induced by 0.25 pM under aerobic 
conditions (data are not shown).
Finally, experiments were carried out to compare the DNA damage under aerobic and 
hypoxic conditions. Results (Fig 5.5 a and b) showed a similar degree of DNA strand 
breaks were induced under hypoxic conditions as in the presence of air. However, in 
certain experiments a slight increase in DNA interstrand cross-link frequency was 
observed under hypoxia.
BE Cell DNA Damage
In contrast to HT29 cells, BE cells treated for 2 hours with a concentration of 0.25 
pM E09 under aerobic conditions showed little or no evidence of any DNA damage

Fig. 5.5 Alkaline elution profiles for human (a and b) HT29 and (c and d) BE cells 
exposed to 0.25 pM E09 for a period of 2 hours under (a and c) aerobic or

experiment although similar trends were seen in repeat experiments 
carried out under identical conditions.
(Fig 5.5 c). This was indicated in the elution profiles where curves of both irradiated 
and unirradiated treated samples were almost coincident with those of their respective 
controls. The frequency of DNA damage was low at 0.147 cross-links / 10 9 daltons 
of DNA and 0.247 strand breaks / 10 9 daltons of DNA respectively.
Where E09 concentration was increased to 10 pM, a concentration previously shown 
to be toxic over a 3 hour exposure under aerobic conditions (Plumb and Workman, 
1994), DNA damage was evident (elution profiles not shown). A significant quantity 
of DNA strand breaks were induced with a frequency of 6.42 strand breaks / 10 9 
daltons of DNA. DNA cross-link induction was however still low at 0.37 lesions / 
109 daltons of DNA
In contrast to results seen with HT29 cells, hypoxia dramatically altered the DNA 
damage induced by E09/ V in terms of both DNA interstrand cross-links and DNA 
strand breaks. The difference between aerobic and hypoxic DNA damage was greater 
at the lower concentration of 0.25 pM E09. Fig 5.5 d illustrates the elution profile 
for 0.25 pM E09 exposure to BE cells under hypoxic conditions. The curve for the 
irradiated treated cell sample now lies well above that of the control, indicating a 
retarded rate of elution, characteristic of DNA interstrand cross-links. A larger 
proportion of DNA strand breaks were also apparent as shown by a faster rate of 
elution of the unirradiated sample as compared to the control. Calculation of the 
frequencies revealed a strand break frequency of 1.98 lesions / 10 9 daltons DNA and 
DNA interstrand cross-link frequency of 3.36 lesions / 10 9 daltons DNA.
5.3.2 Plasmid Strand Break Assay
Following aerobic incubation of plasmid DNA with E09, DT-diaphorase and NADH 
cofactor, DNA strand breaks were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figs 5.6 
5.7 and 5.8). Plasmid DNA in the supercoiled form is converted to open circular and 
finally linear DNA following single or double strand break induction respectively. As 
a result of their differing conformation these migrate unequally in the gel and are 
therefore resolvable. The extent of DNA strand breaks was found to increase with 
increasing drug (Fig 5.6) or enzyme concentration (Fig 5.7) as well as with increasing 
incubation time (Fig 5.8) up to 90 minutes. Control incubations where either drug, 
enzyme or cofactor were omitted showed little or no evidence of DNA damage (Figs 
5.6, 5.7 and 5.8).

Inclusion of superoxide dismutase in the reaction mixture resulted in approximately 
30-40% decrease in DNA strandbreak formation (Fig 5.9). However, where either 
catalase was added alone or in combination with superoxide dismutase, DNA strand 
breaks were completely abolished (Fig 5.9).
When DT-diaphorase was replaced with NAD(P)H: cytochrome P450 reductase 
similar results were obtained. An increase in the quantity of single DNA strand 
breaks occurred with increasing drug (Fig 5.10) and enzyme concentration (Fig 5.11) 
as well as with incubation time (Fig 5.12).
Experiments were also carried out to investigate DNA strand break formation under 
hypoxic conditions. Results (data not shown) showed that damage was caused to 
DNA when it was incubated with drug and cofactor in the presence of DT-diaphorase. 
Surprisingly this was inhibitable by superoxide dismutase and catalase suggesting that 
damage resulted from oxygen radicals. Some degree of protection against DNA 
strand break formation was also detected with SR 4233 using the same system. These 
data would therefore suggest that conditions were not sufficiently anoxic and 
contained a low percentage of oxygen or alternatively that oxygen could cause DNA

Following incubation of E09 with DT-diaphorase in the presence of cofactor 
(NADH) cross-link formation in plasmid pBR 322 DNA was detected using the 
plasmid cross-link assay (Fig 5.13). This was indicated by conversion of single 
stranded denatured DNA to the double stranded form. The two bands present in the 
denatured control correspond to the two single strands of DNA which differ in 
electrophoretic mobility. Cross-link formation increased with increasing drug 
concentration from 0-1 |iM but then decreased again from 1-100 JiM. The extent of 
DNA-cross-links also increased with increasing enzyme concentration and was not 
evident in controls where drug, enzyme or cofactor were omitted. Interestingly, E09 
induced a greater extent of cross-links than equivalent concentrations of the 
established bifunctional alkylating agent chlorambucil.

complete chain elongation and thus a strong band corresponding to a full length 
fragment of 263 base pairs was visible at the top of the gel with additional feint bands 
corresponding to a few shorter length fragments arising from random polymerase 
detachment (Fig 14 (a), Lane A). Chlorambucil, the positive control, exhibited a 
number of distinct bands along the length of the gel (Fig 14 (a), Lane B) indicating 
the occurrence of covalent DNA lesions resulting in the synthesis of shortened 
fragments of DNA. In general, chlorambucil bands correspond to lesions at guanine 
residues, particularly in runs of consecutive guanines. Where E09 alone was 
incubated with the plasmid, DNA modification was again observed (Fig 14 (a), Lane 
E). Some of the lesions observed for E09 were co-incident with those of 
chlorambucil, with E09 also showing a preference for guanines although fewer were 
modified. However, the banding pattern was in general, different from that of 
chlorambucil with E09 binding more specifically. In particular, a number of bases 
modified by chlorambucil either were not alkylated or were alkylated to a lesser 
degree by unactivated E09 e.g. adenines in the sequence GCA. E09 did however 
alkylate some bases more strongly than chlorambucil such as the adenine in the 
sequence GTATC (base pair number 515 in pBR 322 DNA), two cytosines in the 
sequence GCA and three cytosines in the sequence pu pu C pu (where pu denotes 
purine). Where cofactor was included with drug (Fig 14 (a), Lane D), but still in the 
absence of enzyme an almost identical pattern was observed to that of drug alone. 
For incubations containing enzyme, either in the presence (Fig 14 (a), Lanes G, H, I 
and J) or absence of cofactor (Fig 14 (a), Lane C), a reduction in band intensity was 
observed indicative of fewer lesions. When E09 was omitted (Fig 14 (a), Lane F) or 
was at low concentration (Fig 14 (a), Lane G) no damage above the control (Lane A) 
was observed. Interestingly, where E09 had been incubated with a complete 
activating system consisting of cofactor, NADH and DT-diaphorase (Fig 14 (a), 
Lanes G, H, I and J) a different banding pattern was observed to that of drug alone 
(Fig 14 (a), Lane E). As can be seen from Fig 5.14 (a) there were distinct areas of 
difference with binding being more specific following activation. Some bases were 
modified with activated E09 that were not alkylated by either chlorambucil or 
unactivated drug (Fig 14, (a), (b) and (c)). These included principally, four changes 
in cytosines, two of which were in the sequence TGC (positions 562 and 566) and one 
adenine in the sequence CAT (position 491). Further distinct differences were visible 
however, unfortunately these were towards the top of the gel which was less clearly 
resolvable and therefore difficult to determine the base number.

5.4 Discussion
The chemistry of E09 suggests that upon reduction it could generate potentially 
damaging radicals. These may exert a range of cellular effects including the 
induction of DNA strand breaks. In addition, the presence of the aziridine moiety and 
hydroxyl leaving groups confer the potential to act as a bifunctional alkylating agent. 
Thus it was expected that the cytotoxic mechanism of E09 may involve DNA 
damage as has been suggested for a number of other related agents such as AZQ 
(Siegel et al,  1990a) and mitomycin C (for review see Powis, 1987). Experiments 
described in this chapter were therefore designed to investigate whether cytotoxic 
concentrations of E09 caused DNA damage. The involvement of individual enzymes 
in activation of E09 to a DNA damaging species was also examined using cell free 
systems.
Alkaline elution experiments investigated DNA strand break and interstrand cross­
link induction in DNA following exposure of intact tumour cells to E09. Initial 
experiments examined DNA damage in rat Walker tumour cells. This cell line was 
selected for a two reasons: a) the differential toxicity to E09 between sensitive and 
resistant cells seen in cytotoxicity studies which indicate the likely presence of cross­
links: b) DT-diaphorase used in enzyme studies had been purified from Walker cells. 
Following continuous exposure to E09 a significant amount of strand-breaks were 
detected but DNA cross-link frequency appeared to be extremely low. This was due 
to the DNA strand breaks obscuring detection of DNA cross-links. By optimising the 
dose schedule to 4 nM applied four times at four hourly intervals cross-links were 
detectable. It is likely that both DNA strand breaks and cross-links are formed 
following each addition of E09 but that during the interval between doses DNA 
repair occurs. This is more efficient for DNA strand breaks than for DNA interstrand 
cross-links and thus cross-links accumulate with successive doses whilst DNA strand 
breaks frequency is maintained at a lower level.
It must be noted that this alkaline elution procedure does not distinguish between 
frank DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. These are areas where a drug-DNA 
adduct has been formed which renders the DNA sensitive to breakage under the 
alkaline conditions present during the elution process. These sites may also undergo 
repair within the cell but the kinetics of repair are likely to differ from those of frank 
breaks. The data presented in this chapter have shown that a large extent of the E09- 
induced strand breaks formed in Walker cell DNA were repaired over a 20 hour
110
recovery period and it is therefore likely that these were due to frank breaks rather 
than the presence of alkali labile sites.
Walker cells have large amounts of DT-diaphorase, an enzyme shown to metabolise 
E09 (Chapter 3) and are very sensitive to this drug (Chapter 4). It was therefore 
possible that this enzyme may play a role in activation of E09 to a DNA damaging 
species which is responsible for the cytotoxicity observed. The involvement of DT- 
diaphorase in the cytotoxic mechanism was also indicated from studies using a pair of 
human colon carcinoma cell lines, HT29 and BE tumour cells. HT29 cells contain a 
high level of DT-diaphorase and were found to be more sensitive to E 09 under 
aerobic conditions than are BE cells which do not express a functional form of the 
enzyme (Walton et al , 1992a; Plumb and Workman, 1994). A similar correlation 
between levels of DT-diaphorase and sensitivity to E09 has also been reported for a 
large range of cell lines by a number of other investigators (Robertson et al,  1994; 
Smitskamp-Wilms et al,  1994). Interestingly, under hypoxia the BE cells were 
greatly sensitised to E09 whereas little effect was observed with the HT29 cells 
(Plumb and Workman, 1994).
Results from alkaline elution experiments (Section 5.3.1) show that following 
treatment with 0.25 pM E09 both DNA strand breaks and DNA interstrand cross­
links were formed in HT29 cells but little damage was evident in BE cells. This 
concentration of drug is around the IC 50 value for E09 in HT29 cells with a 3 hour 
exposure (Plumb and Workman, 1994). Alkaline elution experiments used a 2 hour 
exposure time although little difference in toxicity would be expected between 2 and 
3 hours. Under identical treatment conditions little cell kill was noted in BE cells 
(Plumb and Workman, 1994), thus the trend in DNA damage correlates well to the 
cytotoxic potency of E09. Increasing the concentration of E09 to 10 pM, which is 
around the IC50 value (3 hour exposure) for BE cells, caused a large amount of strand 
breaks in their DNA. Hence again a correlation between DNA damage and 
cytotoxicity was apparent. The small extent of cross-links induced in BE cell DNA at 
this cytotoxic concentration of E09 may reflect a different mechanism of cytotoxicity 
to that occurring with HT29 cells under aerobic conditions. Little further increase in 
DNA damage of HT29 cells was observed at 10 pM E09 compared with 0.25 pM.
Incubations carried out under hypoxic conditions showed little or no increase in 
strand break induction in HT29 cell DNA although a small increase in DNA cross­
link frequency was observed in some experiments. This correlates with the small (2.9 
fold) increase in cytotoxicity seen under hypoxia in HT29 cells (Plumb and
111
Workman, 1994). Interestingly, BE cells showed a dramatic 30 fold increase in the 
extent of cross-links formed when hypoxic conditions prevailed. This may explain 
the 1000-3000 hypoxic cytotoxicity differential reported by Plumb and Workman 
(1994).
As well as the difference in DT-diaphorase activity, HT29 cells posses the DNA 
repair enzyme 06-alkyl guanine alkyl transferase whereas the BE cells do not. It is 
however unlikely that this enzyme would be involved in the repair of adducts formed 
by E09 although it has been implicated in mitomycin C damage repair (Dusre et al , 
1989). In addition if the alkyl transferase deficiency were important in repair of E09 
induced DNA damage the HT29 cells would be expected to be less sensitive to E09 
than the repair deficient BE cells and in fact the opposite situation is observed under 
aerobic conditions (Plumb and Workman, 1994).
To summarise, DNA damage was detected at pharmacologically relevant, cytotoxic 
concentrations in both human and rat tumour cell lines following exposure to E09 
under aerobic conditions. Hypoxia increased the level of DNA damage moderately in 
HT29 cells but considerably in the BE cells thus the trend in DNA damage followed 
that of cytotoxicity. This suggested that DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross­
links may be involved in the mechanism of E09 induced cell kill. The greater 
aerobic cell sensitivity and DNA damage observed in the high DT-diaphorase 
expressing cell lines, Walker and HT29, as compared to that of the BE cells which 
does not posses a functional form of the enzyme, supports the involvement of DT- 
diaphorase in the activation of E09 to a cytotoxic species. One way of examining 
this involvement further would be to include dicoumarol, an inhibitor of DT- 
diaphorase, in the damage assays. The problems involved with using this compound 
have however been outlined previously (Chapter 3). For this reason the ability of 
both DT-diaphorase and of NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase, which has also 
been shown to metabolise E09 (Chapter 3) to activate E09 to a DNA damaging 
species has been determined in cell free systems. In these cell free studies the 
concentrations of reaction constituents were optimised to suit the sensitivity of the 
assay and therefore were not of direct pharmacological relevance.
An agarose gel method employing plasmid DNA was used to examine strand break 
induction by E09 following its activation by DT-diaphorase and NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase. In addition to showing that both these enzymes can 
metabolise E09, ESR experiments (Chapter 3) have indicated that the reduction 
generates both drug and oxygen-based radicals. These are potentially damaging
112
species and may be responsible for the DNA strand breaks observed in alkaline 
elution experiments. Results obtained using the plasmid agarose gel method (Section
5.3.2) confirmed the findings of Walton and co-workers (1991) that, in a cell free 
system, DT-diaphorase is able to activate E09 to a DNA strand breaking species. 
The extent of this form of DNA damage was dependent on the concentration of 
enzyme and E09 up to saturating levels at which point no further increase was 
observed. The level of damage also increased with increasing incubation time. 
Inclusion of both superoxide dismutase and catalase together decreased the proportion 
of DNA strand breaks to near background levels. These enzymes function to remove 
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide from the system, thus this would indicate that 
oxygen radicals, rather than drug-based radical species, were responsible for the 
damage observed. This is consistent with the finding that superoxide dismutase and 
catalase abolished the oxygen radical signal but not drug radical signal obtained by 
ESR (Chapter 3). Walton and co-workers (1991) had not previously investigated the 
addition of catalase as well as superoxide dismutase to the system. In the experiments 
described here, inclusion of superoxide dismutase alone in the incubation of DT- 
diaphorase with E09 and cofactor led to a small if any reduction in the amount of 
DNA strand breaks induced. These results are also in good agreement with those 
obtained by Walton and co-workers (1991).
Interestingly, in preliminary experiments where Tris-Cl buffer was employed in place 
of phosphate buffer a high level of background DNA damage was observed where 
DT-diaphorase was incubated with DNA and cofactor alone in the absence of drug. 
Other investigators have observed the generation of oxygen radicals by ESR 
following incubation of cofactor with DT-diaphorase in the absence of drug (Knox et 
al, personal communication). It appears that DT-diaphorase, in the presence of 
cofactor, may be able to reduce molecular oxygen. Due to this activity subsequent 
experiments utilised phosphate buffer and followed the method described by Walton 
and co-workers (1991) where no background damage had been reported.
The original intentions of these studies were firstly to confirm the results obtained by 
Walton and co-workers (1991) and then to further characterise the involvement of 
oxygen radicals involved in DNA damage by using superoxide dismutase and 
catalase. A further aim was to examine the effect of hypoxia on DNA strand break 
induction. In Chapter 3 it was suggested that both oxygen and drug-based radicals 
were formed following DT-diaphorase reduction of E09, predominantly by auto­
oxidation of the metabolite in the presence of molecular oxygen. Theory would 
therefore suggest that under hypoxic conditions little or no oxygen radicals should be
113
generated. The proportion of drug-based radicals should also be reduced although 
some may be formed by comproportionation :  disproportionation reactions. Thus a 
reduction in DNA damage would be expected under low oxygen conditions. 
Surprisingly, assays carried out under hypoxia also showed evidence of DNA strand 
break induction which was inhibitable by superoxide dismutase and catalase. Fewer 
(1.5 to 2 fold) DNA strand breaks were formed under hypoxia than in air and these 
were inhibitable by about 50 % with superoxide dismutase and catalase compared 
with about 70 % inhibition experienced in aerobic incubations. Interestingly the 
amount of damage remaining in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase 
was similar when incubations were carried out under either air or hypoxia and the 
levels were only slightly higher than the background of the assay. The hypoxic 
protection conferred by superoxide dismutase and catalase could be due to the 
presence of residual oxygen in the system despite the stringent conditions used, 
although this seems unlikely as increasing the pregassing time from 10 to 30 minutes 
did not significantly alter damage observed. The extreme oxygen sensitivity of the 
E09 metabolite formed by DT-diaphorase reduction has been discussed in Chapter 3 
Following termination of the assay by addition of stop buffer the sample is loaded on 
to the agarose gel for electrophoresis, during which time it inevitably comes in to 
contact with oxygen. It is possible that the high oxygen sensitivity of the metabolite 
permits auto-oxidation to occur at this stage generating strand breaking oxygen-based 
radicals. Experiments carried out by other investigators using the benzotriazine di-N- 
oxide SR4233 in the same system showed DNA damage following activation by DT- 
diaphorase under hypoxic but not aerobic conditions. This was partially inhibited by 
superoxide dismutase and catalase indicating that the a sufficient degree of hypoxia 
prevailed to stabilise the DNA damaging metabolite to some extent. Thus the assay 
system may be suitable for some compounds but not others depending upon the 
oxygen sensitivity of the metabolites generated.
ESR studies (Chapter 3) have shown that in addition to DT-diaphorase, 
NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase could activate E 09 to generate drug and 
oxygen-based radicals in the presence of cofactor. For this reason the involvement of 
this enzyme in activation of E09 to a DNA damaging species was also investigated. 
The results showed that DNA strand breaks were induced where E09 was incubated 
under aerobic conditions with NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase and cofactor. As 
in the case of DT-diaphorase, controls where drug, cofactor or enzyme were omitted 
resulted in no or very low level of DNA strand break induction. In addition, the 
extent of damage was dependent on the concentration of drug and enzyme as well as 
incubation time. In the case of NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase the drug radical
114
should be formed directly by one-electron reduction rather than by auto-oxidation of 
the metabolites. ESR experiments have shown that the radical, presumably the 
semiquinone, is also oxygen sensitive and auto-oxidises to generate oxygen radicals. 
Due to the lack of time and problems encountered with hypoxic DNA strand break 
assays these were not carried out for cytochrome P450 reductase.
Experiments to investigate the effect of DT-diaphorase and NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase on activation of AZQ to a DNA strand breaking species were 
performed by Fisher and Gutierrez (1991a). Similar results were obtained to those 
presented in this chapter for E09, i.e. DT-diaphorase and NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase activation of AZQ led to DNA strand break formation. Protection by 
superoxide dismutase and catalase along with results of ESR experiments suggested 
that oxygen radicals generated via auto-oxidation of metabolites were the damaging 
species.
Alkaline elution experiments have shown DNA cross-link induction following E09 
treatment of cell lines high in DT-diaphorase whereas the BE cells which do not 
express a functional form of the enzyme showed comparatively low levels of DNA 
damage. This would indicate the possible involvement of DT-diaphorase in 
activation of E09 to a DNA cross-linking species. A cell free, plasmid cross-link 
assay was employed to investigate this. Despite the fact that, as with the DNA strand 
break assay, pharmacologically relevant concentrations could not be employed, the 
experiments provided a model system for determination of the ability of particular 
enzymes to catalyse metabolism of E09 to a DNA cross-linking species.
As discussed in Section 5.1. the plasmid cross-link assay is based on the facilitated 
reannealing of single stranded DNA to double stranded DNA in the presence of cross­
links. Where E09 (100|iM) was incubated with DT-diaphorase and cofactor an 
increase in the percentage of double stranded DNA was observed compared with the 
control (Fig 5.13) indicating that DNA cross-links had been induced. The level of 
this damage increased with increasing DT-diaphorase concentration up to certain 
levels at which complete conversion of single stranded to double stranded DNA was 
observed. DNA cross-link frequency also increased with drug concentration up to 1  
|iM. Above this molarity the extent of this DNA damage decreased slightly. In 
control incubations where either drug or cofactor were omitted no double stranded 
DNA was evident implying that neither enzyme combined with cofactor nor enzyme 
combined with drug could cause the DNA interstrand cross-links. However, where 
drug was incubated in the presence of cofactor but in the absence of enzyme a small
115
quantity of double stranded form was observed suggesting that cofactor alone can 
slowly reduce E09 to a difunctional alkylating species. Following reductive 
activation, E09 was found to cross-link plasmid DNA more efficiently than an 
equivalent concentration of the bifunctional alkylating agent chlorambucil.
Thus these experiments have confirmed that DT-diaphorase reduction of E09 
functions to activate the compound to a difunctional alkylating species capable of 
cross-linking plasmid DNA. In a similar manner the aziridinylbenzoquinones related 
to AZQ (Hartley et al,  1991a; Lee et al,  1992) have also been found to require 
activation catalysed by DT-diaphorase to induce DNA cross-links at physiological pH 
(Hartley et al,  1991a; Lee et al,  1992). Some DNA damage was however observed at 
pH 7 in the absence of activation by the related compounds BZQ (3,6-Bis[(2- 
hydroxyethyl)amino]-2,5-diaziridinyl-l,4-benzoquinone and DZQ (2,5-diaziridinyl- 
1,4-benzoquinone). As in the case of E09, cross-links were however formed at 
physiological pH when drugs were incubated with 0.173 p,g of DT-diaphorase 
purified from rat liver (Lee et al,  1992). For the methyl AZQ analogue, as with E09, 
the frequency of these lesions increased with increasing drug concentration from 2.5 
jxM to 50 |iM (Lee et al,  1992). The effect of pH and chemical reduction was also 
investigated by these authors on the DNA damage caused by the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones. These parameters were not examined for E09. When pH 
was decreased the percentage of cross-links induced by the aziridinylbenzoquinones 
increased to a small degree (Hartley et al,  1991a) whereas chemical reduction with 
ascorbic acid gave cross-links in the case of AZQ and methyl AZQ only. Where both 
reducing conditions and low pH prevailed a significant level of cross-linking was 
observed for all analogues. The extent of this damage, in general, decreased with 
increasing size of substituent.
The enhanced cross-linking ability of both aziridinylbenzoquinones and 
indoloquinones following reduction is likely to result from aziridine ring activation. 
This process is assisted by the change in electron distribution upon quinone reduction 
to either the semiquinone or hydroquinone species (Butler et al,  1989). Low pH may 
also assist aziridine ring activation by protonation.
As discussed in Section 5.1 the specificity of drug binding to particular sequences in 
DNA may be relevant to antitumour activity. The Taq polymerase assay was 
employed to examine the sequence selectivity of covalent modification to DNA by 
E09. It was hoped that this would further the understanding of E09 induced DNA
116
damage at a more molecular level. In addition, it is possible that by understanding 
this selectivity compounds may be rationally designed to target specific nucleotides.
Untreated DNA ran predominantly as a single band corresponding to a 263 base pair 
fragment due to the absence of DNA adducts. Additional bands of very low intensity 
were also observed and may be due to random lesions or the Taq falling off the DNA 
in the absence of lesions.
Chlorambucil is an established alkylating agent which predominantly forms covalent 
adducts with guanine residues resulting in the characteristic banding pattern seen in 
Fig 5.14. This result is consistent with that obtained by other investigators (Wyatt et 
al, unpublished data). Lesions were observed to be more common in runs of 
contiguous guanines than with isolated, bases as has been reported for a number of 
alkylating agents (Ponti et al,  1991)
Surprisingly, perhaps, where E09 was incubated with DNA in the absence of an 
activating system DNA modifications did occur. It is likely that these covalent 
adducts are due to monofunctional alkylation through the aziridine moiety. 
Aziridines are known to be highly reactive groups which can readily bind to 
nucleophiles. Results presented in this chapter show that binding predominantly 
occurs at guanine residues which is consistent with results obtained for other aziridine 
containing compounds (Mattes et al,  1986; Lee et al,  1992). This may be explained 
by the fact that alkylation has been suggested to be related to the electrostatic 
potential of guanine N-7 (Kohn et al,  1988). This differs according to the base 
adjacent to the molecule with the most negative bases being runs of guanines 
(Pullman and Pullman, 1981). Interestingly, the banding pattern seen with E09 is 
distinct from that of chlorambucil with lesions being more specific. Notably, fewer 
bases were modified and all of the adenines in the sequence GCA were alkylated 
more strongly by chlorambucil than by unactivated E09. This could possibly result 
from steric hindrance. E09 was able to alkylate some bases more strongly than 
chlorambucil including an adenine in the sequence GTATC, two cytosines in the 
sequence GCA and three cytosines in the sequence pu pu C pu (where pu indicates a 
purine). Hartley (1993) reported that the non-alkylating portion of the molecule could 
influence the sequence selectivity of alkylation and thus this may to some extent 
explain the differences between E09 and chlorambucil. Where the cofactor, NADH, 
was also included in the presence of drug a similar pattern of DNA adducts was 
obtained. This indicated that if any chemical reduction of the compound was 
occurring by NADH it did not alter the affinity or sequence selectivity of E09 for
117
DNA. For incubations containing the enzyme DT-diaphorase and E 09 but in the 
absence of a complete activating system a similar pattern of DNA modification was 
once again observed but the intensity of binding was decreased. The phenomenon of 
reduced intensity remained consistent wherever enzyme was present even in the 
presence of complete activating system. The reason for the reduction in band 
intensity is unknown. One possibility is that E09 may be binding to the active site of 
the protein and thus the concentration of free drug available for DNA binding is 
reduced.
The effect of DT-diaphorase activation on the sequence selectivity of DNA binding of 
E09 was investigated for various concentrations of drug. The results revealed that, in 
the presence of the enzyme activating system E09 was still able to bind covalently to 
DNA although the amount of adducts appeared to be reduced. Of considerable 
potential importance is the observation that the DNA sequence specificity was 
distinctly different to that obtained in controls where components of the activating 
system had been omitted. In addition to a reduction of band intensity, the compound 
appeared more selective, binding to fewer and different sequences than when 
unactivated. In particular, a few bases were alkylated by the activated drug that were 
not modified by either the unactivated drug or by chlorambucil. These included four 
cytosines of which two were in the sequence TGC, one adenine in the sequence CAT 
and two thymines. Additional distinct differences were in regions of the gel which 
were difficult to interpret as they were less clearly resolved hence the identity of the 
modified bases remain undetermined. In future experiments, running the gel further 
would permit resolution of this region. A change in sequence selectivity following 
activation by DT-diaphorase has been reported during the course of this work for the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones methyl DZQ and DZQ (Lee et al,  1992). A number of 
theories may advanced to explain these observations, (i) The chemistry of E09 
suggests that upon reduction, activation of one or both of the two leaving groups to an 
alkylating species may occur. These themselves may be binding to DNA in 
preference to the aziridine group or alternatively may change the shape or 
electrostatic potential of the molecule and thus alter its binding capacity, (ii) It is 
likely that E09 may be activated to a bifunctional alkylating agent capable of 
inducing DNA cross-links under these conditions. Indeed the results of the agarose 
gel cross-link assay (Section 5.3.3 of this chapter) have confirmed that such a reaction 
occurs. Activation to a bifunctional alkylating agent may result in drug only being 
able to cause cross-links at certain sequences and thus restricting lesions to fewer but 
more specific sites, (iii) Activation to a bifunctional alkylating agent which has 
bound to the protein (enzyme) present in the system to form a DNA-protein cross­
118
link. A further complication may exist in the fact that these concentrations of reaction 
constituents would be expected to generate damaging oxygen radical species which 
have been shown to induce strand breaks in DNA under aerobic conditions (Section
5.3.2). Strand breaks could potentially shorten the fragments of DNA and thus give 
artifactual results mimicking those of a covalent lesion.
One point of concern, as with all the cell free assays, is whether the sequence 
specificity obtained with naked DNA is similar to that which occurs in the whole cell 
system. Experiments carried out by Hartley and co-workers (1992) showed that the 
sequence selectivity seen with mechlorethamine, uracil and quinacrine mustard using 
an isolated 340 base pair a sequence of human DNA was maintained when DNA was 
analysed following extraction from cells treated with these compounds. This would 
indicate that in vitro  assays using naked DNA may be useful in predicting the nature 
of cellular damage.
It has been suggested that chemical substituents may alter the selectivity of binding of 
compounds to DNA (Hartley, 1990); thus the possibility of modifying an agent to 
obtain an analogue with enhanced specificity exists. Unfortunately due to time 
restrictions analogues of E09 were not examined using this assay. This may have 
yielded valuable information and it is suggested that these are carried out in the 
future.
Experiments described in this chapter have confirmed that E09 is able to cause DNA 
damage in the form of strand breaks and DNA interstrand cross-links in human and 
rat cell DNA when applied at cytotoxic doses. The enhanced DNA damage observed 
with increasing cytotoxicity indicates that this may be one mechanism by which E09 
induces cell kill. Results obtained by comparing the high and low DT-diaphorase 
expressing cell lines, HT29 and BE respectively implicates this enzyme in reductive 
activation of E09 to a DNA damaging and cytotoxic species. Indeed, data presented 
in previous chapters of this thesis have shown that E09 is metabolised by DT- 
diaphorase derived from both rat and human tumour cells and that this leads to the 
formation of potentially damaging drug and oxygen-based radicals under aerobic 
conditions. Results from the plasmid DNA strand break and cross-link assays show 
that purified DT-diaphorase in a cell free system can activate E09 to a species which 
can cause both DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links. Using superoxide 
dismutase and catalase, it appears that DNA strand break formation may result from 
oxygen radicals rather than drug-based radicals. NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase has also been shown to metabolise E09 to generate oxygen and drug-based
119
radicals (Chapter 3). Strand break assays confirmed that this reduction may also 
activate E09 to a species capable of inducing strand breaks in plasmid DNA. Due to 
lack of time the involvement of this enzyme in activation of E09 to a cross-linking 
species was not investigated.
The use of these cell free systems has permitted identification of enzymes which can 
metabolise E09 to a DNA damaging species. These have also shown that E09 in the 
absence of an activating system, at physiological pH, cannot cause significant strand 
breaks or interstrand cross-links in naked DNA. Monofunctional adducts were 
however detected. The significance of these activating systems in eliciting cellular 
DNA damage does however remain to be elucidated. The involvement of a particular 
enzyme in metabolism of E09 will depend on the levels of other bioreducing 
enzymes present as well as their relative affinities for E09. It must also be noted that 
the experiments described in this chapter used plasmid DNA which may differ from 
the reactions experienced with human DNA. DNA repair systems within the cell will 
also be a determining factor in the level and importance of the various forms of 
damage induced.
In the case of HT29 and Walker cells both one and two-electron reduction may occur. 
Under aerobic conditions it is likely that both the semiquinone and hydroquinone 
products will auto-oxidise to generate the toxic radicals which may cause DNA strand 
breaks. Strand break experiments suggest that this form of DNA damage is generated 
by oxygen-based radicals rather than drug-based radicals. In the isolated cell system 
DNA cross-links were also formed under oxic conditions following aerobic reduction 
of E 09 by DT-diaphorase. This may indicate that the one-electron reduced 
metabolite formed by auto-oxidation of the two-electron reduced product is the DNA 
cross-linking species. Alternatively it is possible that, due to the close proximity of 
the strong nucleophile, the hydroquinone binds to DNA causing a cross-link before 
oxidation can occur. Hypoxia should favour formation of the hydroquinone over the 
semiquinone. Thus if this two-electron reduced metabolite were the DNA damaging 
species DNA interstrand cross-links should be enhanced in the absence of oxygen. In 
fact only a small increase in DNA damage was observed in HT29 cells. In contrast 
BE cells showed a large increase in DNA cross-link formation under hypoxia. The 
semiquinone formed by one-electron reduction would be stabilised under these 
conditions which would suggest that this was the product responsible for DNA cross­
links. However, by stabilising the semiquinone, further one-electron reduction may 
be permitted to generate the hydroquinone. Thus the nature of the DNA cross-linking 
species remains unclear. One point of note is that under low oxygen conditions the
120
sensitivity of BE cells to E09 is greatly increased beyond that of HT29 cells. It is 
possible that although the BE and HT29 cells posses relatively similar levels of 
NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase, the lack of DT-diaphorase in the BE cells 
favours the one-electron reduction pathway to generates more semiquinone than 
hydroquinone and that it is this metabolite which is the more toxic.
To conclude, results presented in this chapter have shown that DNA damage in the 
form of both DNA interstrand cross-links and DNA strand breaks are induced in rat 
Walker tumour cell lines and human HT29 and BE cell lines following treatment with 
E09. The occurrence of these lesions at concentrations of E 09 relevant to 
cytotoxicity indicate that DNA damage may be an important mechanism of E09 
induced cell kill. Results of cell free assays suggest that both DT-diaphorase and 
NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase may be involved in activation of E09 to these 
cytotoxic, DNA damaging metabolites, the identity of which remains to be clarified.

Chapter 6
Metabolism of Aziridinylbenzoquinone Compounds
by DT-diaphorase
6.1 Introduction
The structurally related quinone compound AZQ has the potential to undergo 
bioreductive activation in a similar manner to that described earlier in this thesis for 
E09 (Chapter 3). This may involve either one or two-electron reduction generating 
the semiquinone or the hydroquinone species respectively. Toxicity may then result 
from oxidative stress and / or alkylation of critical biological components.
AZQ has been shown to be reduced electrochemically, chemically, by intact cells and 
by microsomes, as well as by certain isolated enzyme systems (for references see 
below). Electrochemical reduction experiments (Mossaba et al,  1985) have revealed 
a number of important features of AZQ and its reduced products. In aqueous medium 
electrochemical reduction leads to the formation of the two-electron reduced dianion 
which is auto-oxidised to the semiquinone and parent compound. In DMSO one- 
electron reduction steps are possible; this permitted characterisation of AZQ and the 
one and two-electron reduced species by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy 
(Mossaba et al,  1985). Further experiments carried out by Mossaba and co-workers 
(1985) using ESR have characterised the semiquinone formed by electrochemical 
reduction. These investigators also suggested that the reduction of AZQ to the 
dihydroquinone occurred more rapidly at lower pH values. Results from cyclic 
voltammetry experiments indicate that aziridine ring opening is assisted following 
reduction of the quinone (Mossaba et al,  1985).
Reduction of AZQ can also be carried out chemically using sodium borohydride. 
ESR studies with low concentrations of this reducing agent have detected the yellow 
AZQ free radical anion which is stable under anaerobic conditions. Higher 
concentrations of reducing agent yield the hydroquinone which is capable of 
undergoing auto-oxidation to the free radical form. This may then react further to 
yield a monoaziridine (Guttierez et al,  1987). Studies using either sodium 
borohydride or NADPH have revealed that reduction of AZQ is required for the 
induction of DNA interstrand cross-linking (King et al,  1984; Szmigiero and Kohn,
122
1984). These reactions are pH dependent with greater DNA damage being exhibited 
at low pH.
Evidence of AZQ reduction within intact cells has again been provided by ESR 
studies which have detected free radicals following exposure of cells to AZQ. The 
cell lines in which this has been demonstrated include K562 and L1210 (Egorin et al,  
1985; Lea et al,  1988; Butler et al,  1990; Dzielendziak et al,  1990), Hep-2
(Gutierrez, 1986), HL 60 (Egorin et al,  1985) and BSM and RAJI cells (Dzielendziak 
et al,  1990).
The ability of particular subcellular fractions and of certain purified enzymes to 
catalyse reduction of AZQ has also been determined. Metabolism of AZQ catalysed 
by rat liver microsomes and rat liver nuclei, as well as by purified NADPH :  
cytochrome P450 reductase, was indicated by NADPH-dependent oxygen 
consumption and by production of a free radical intermediate as detected by ESR 
(Gutierrez et al,  1982; Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991b).
Initial studies employing HT29 colon carcinoma cells revealed that AZQ could 
undergo metabolism and exert cytotoxicity in a fashion which was inhibitable by 
dicoumarol (Ross et al,  1990). This suggested a role for DT-diaphorase in both the 
reduction and bioactivation of AZQ in this cell line. Further support for the 
involvement of DT-diaphorase came from experiments in which HT29 cells were 
compared with the BE colon carcinoma cell line which, due to a mutation in the 
NQOl gene encoding DT-diaphorase, does not express a functional form of DT- 
diaphorase (Traver et al,  1992). In addition to cytotoxicity, interstrand cross-linking 
was reduced by dicoumarol in the HT29 cell line whereas no effect was seen with this 
inhibitor in the case of the less sensitive BE cells (Siegel et al,  1990a). Subsequent 
experiments involving use of a highly purified form of the HT29 cell human DT- 
diaphorase confirmed that AZQ could act as a substrate for this enzyme. Further 
examination of the DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction of AZQ was carried out using 
a more readily available purified rat hepatic enzyme (Siegel et al,  1990a).
Flavin reductases including DT-diaphorase present in the S9 fraction of MCF-7 
human breast cancer cells have also been shown to metabolise AZQ under both 
aerobic and hypoxic conditions (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991b). DT-diaphorase 
reduction generated both the drug free radical anion and oxygen radicals. It appears 
that these are formed from auto-oxidation of the metabolite presumed to be the 
hydroquinone, as well as from comproportionation reactions.
123
A number of studies carried out on compounds structurally related to AZQ have 
indicated that modification alters many characteristics including metabolism. One 
example is BZQ, the analogue in which the carboethoxyamino groups have been 
substituted with ethanolamine groups. This differed from AZQ in stability, one- 
electron reduction potential, enzymatic reduction, DNA alkylation, cellular uptake 
and efflux (Butler et al,  1990) as well as in cytotoxicity (Lea et al,  1988). For this 
reason Dr John Butler and co-workers at the Patterson Institute, Manchester, 
synthesised a set of novel diaziridinylbenzoquinones in which the carboethoxyamino 
moieties were substituted by a variety of different hydrocarbon groups as illustrated 
in Fig 6.1 (Dzielendziak and Butler, 1989). Initial experiments carried out on these 
analogues revealed differences in their cytotoxicity, free radical generation, DNA 
cross-linking ability, one-electron reduction potential and metabolism by NADPH- 
requiring enzymes in cell sonicates (Dzielendziak et al,  1990).
At the time of carrying out the studies outlined in this chapter there had been no 
publications reporting the metabolism of these AZQ analogues by DT-diaphorase. 
We were particularly interested in the relevance of this enzyme due to its ability to 
metabolise AZQ (Siegel et al,  1992) as well as its increased expression and activity in 
some tumours (see Chapter 1) but most importantly to complement the work carried 
out on E09 analogues (Chapter 3). The purpose of the work described in this chapter 
was therefore to investigate the ability of the AZQ analogues to be metabolised by 
DT-diaphorase. It was hoped that this may aid elucidation of structural features 
which may optimise the reductive activation of AZQ by DT-diaphorase.
6.2 Methods
6.2.1 Metabolism of Aziridinylbenzoquinones
The metabolism of AZQ and related analogues was analysed spectrophotometrically 
using the cytochrome c reduction assay. The method was identical to that described 
in Chapter 2 except that full kinetics were carried out using 0.1 fig of purified rat 
Walker DT-diaphorase in a total volume of 1  ml of buffer. Linearity of the substrate 
with respect to enzyme concentration was examined by varying the concentration of 
DT-diaphorase between 0 and 0.1 jig / ml. The cofactor NADH concentration was 
also optimised. A slight lag phase occurred during the progress of the reaction and 
the initial activity was calculated from the linear portion of the curve.

6.3 Results
6.3.1 General Features of the Cytochrome c Reduction Assay
Results obtained using the cytochrome c reduction assay demonstrated that AZQ was 
able to undergo metabolism catalysed by purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (Fig 6.2 
and Table 6.1). Typical progress curves obtained during this reduction process with 
various concentrations of AZQ are shown in Fig 6.2 a. These illustrate that the rate of 
reduction was linear throughout the two minute duration of the assay, and this was 
also true for reactions carried out over 4 minutes (data not shown). Increasing AZQ 
concentration increased the rate of reaction whilst still retaining a linear progress 
curve (Fig 6.2 a). Controls carried out where drug was omitted resulted in an 
extremely low level of activity (0.47 nmoles cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg) and 
this was therefore disregarded for calculation purposes. Exclusion of enzyme did 
give a fairly high background but for all analogues the activity in the absence of 
enzyme was similar if not slightly higher than that in the presence of dicoumarol. 
This non-enzymatic, dicoumarol insensitive activity could therefore be attributable to 
direct chemical reduction of the quinones by NADH. For the experiments where 
NADH was omitted no activity was noted.
Structural modification of AZQ resulted in an altered ability to be metabolised by 
DT-diaphorase (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). It was also observed that for some AZQ 
analogues, particularly sec-butyl AZQ and /so-butyl AZQ, a completely linear 
progress curve was not always obtained but an initial lag phase was present (Fig 6.2). 
The length of this varied to a small extent between repeat experiments carried out for 
individual analogues for a given drug concentration. The progress curves for AZQ 
and methyl AZQ, which in contrast did give a linear progress curve are also 
illustrated in Fig 6.2. The most striking lag phase was noted with sec-butyl and iso­
butyl  AZQ (Fig 6.2) where this persisted for approximately 60 seconds. In standard 
fashion, all activities were calculated from the linear part of the curve. Experiments 
where the reaction was initiated by cofactor, enzyme or substrate all showed a similar 
lag phase. Where dicoumarol was included again a lag phase was observed.
Effect of Altering Cofactor Concentration
The effect of altering the concentration of the NADH cofactor on the rate of reaction 
was investigated for each analogue in order to confirm that this was optimum. In 
general increasing NADH concentration did not result in any significant increase in

the dicoumarol inhibitable activity as exemplified by AZQ in Table 6.3. In most 
cases the overall activity did rise but the background obtained in the presence of 
dicoumarol similarly increased, resulting in no overall change. In the case of iso- 
propyl AZQ reducing the concentration of cofactor NADH did however decrease the 
activity obtained (Table 6.3). The results therefore indicated that 2 mM NADH, in 
addition to being optimum concentration for menadione metabolism, was also 
favourable for the majority of the aziridinylbenzoquinones analysed. In the case of 
fso-butyl AZQ, the dicoumarol inhibitable activity obtained on use of 4 mM and 8 
mM NADH was actually lower than that at 2 mM, thus suggesting some inhibition 
due to cofactor. Seobutyl AZQ was exceptional. This analogue continued to show 
an increase in dicoumarol inhibitable activity up to 10 mM before a slight decrease in 
activity was again observed at 20 mM, this indicating an optimum of around 10 mM 
NADH.
Effect o f Altering Enzyme Concentration
Selected experiments to examine the effect of altered enzyme concentration were also 
performed. Due to shortage of compound these were repeated only for the wo-propyl 
and sec-butyl analogues but similar results were seen for the other compounds. In 
general at least three enzyme concentrations were studied in addition to the minus 
enzyme control. A 400 pM substrate concentration was employed for all compounds 
with the exception of AZQ for which 200 pM was used. The n-butyl and iso-butyl 
analogues showed good linearity with respect to enzyme concentration within the 
range 0.02-0. lpg / ml, AZQ and the methyl, rc-propyl, and sec-butyl analogues were 
reasonably linear within this range. Initial studies with the /so-propyl analogue 
showed a deviation from this trend with little increase in activity when enzyme 
concentration was doubled from 0.05 pg / ml to 0.1 pg / ml. Repeat experiments 
using 50 pM wo-propyl AZQ did reveal linearity within the range 0.0083-0.1 pg / ml. 
The sec-butyl analogue was also re-examined due to the limited number of 
concentrations used initially. Again a 50 pM concentration was employed which 
resulted in linearity although the activity obtained was extremely low.
Effect of Altering Substrate Concentration
The effect of increasing the concentration of each compound on the rate of reduction 
is shown in Fig 6.3. In the case of AZQ, activity increased in a linear fashion with 
increasing substrate concentration up to 800 pM. A similar type of result was 
obtained with «-propyl AZQ. A linear increase in activity was also seen for iso-

rate of reduction (v, n moles of cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg 
protein) catalysed by rat Walker DT-diaphorase. Data are taken from an 
individual experiment and in general (except where drug availability was 
limiting) were confirmed in an independent repeat study. Repeats were 
however also carried out for several of the data points within the assay.
propyl AZQ up to 200 jxM drug concentration, however at 400 pM the profile curved 
upwards in a more exponential manner. The lack of evidence for substrate saturation 
observed with AZQ and analogues n-propyl and iso-propyl AZQ would suggest a 
high Km value. In contrast, the curves obtained for n-butyl, methyl and iso-butyl 
AZQ were linear up to concentrations of 200 - 400 |iM after which they began to 
plateau, indicative of substrate saturation occurring. The Km values for these 
compounds are likely to be high compared with certain other quinone compounds 
such as E09 (see Chapter 3) but lower than for AZQ and its rc-propyl and iso-propyl 
analogues. Seobutyl AZQ was exceptional in the fact that activity decreased when 
increasing the substrate concentration above 400 (iM. It is however probable that this 
phenomenon resulted from the limited solubility of the compound#
6.3.2 Enzyme Kinetic Parameters
A number of methods of graphical analysis exist for the determination of enzyme 
kinetic parameters. Displaying the data as a Lineweaver Burk plot (where 1/v is 
plotted against 1/S) reveals a linear relationship for AZQ (Fig 6.4 b) and also the n- 
butyl and /so-propyl analogues (data not shown). Other structural analogues deviated 
to a varying degree from linearity (e.g. Fig 6.5 b). As previously discussed (Chapter 
2) the Hanes Woolf plot (S/v against S) has been considered the most accurate 
method for determination of the Km and Vmax values. When the data are displayed 
in this manner, a linear relationship is again observed for AZQ (Fig 6.4 c) in addition 
to the rc-butyl analogue (data not shown). However, the iso-butyl compound (Fig 6.5 
c) deviates from linearity as do the sec-butyl, iso-propyl, methyl and n-propyl 
analogues indicating that in general these aziridinylbenzoquinones do not conform to 
simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. For this reason Km and Vmax values could not be 
obtained.
Because of this, in order to compare the relative abilities of the compounds to be 
reduced by DT-diaphorase, the activities have been reported in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 at 
two concentrations of drug, that is 200 and 400 fiM. Different batches of enzyme 
may vary slightly in activity for equivalent amounts of protein due to a number of 
factors including the age of the preparation. In addition, small differences may also 
be observed in reaction constituents between days leading to a different activity being 
obtained for the same concentration of enzyme and compound. For this reason the 
benchmark quinone menadione was included as a positive control in each set of 
assays carried out. Thus in addition to expressing the activities in mg of protein

Metabolism of iso-butyl AZQ catalysed by purified rat Walker DT- 
diaphorase displayed as (a) a plot of activity (v, n moles of cytochrome c 
reduced / minute / mg protein) against substrate concentration (S, |iM), (b) 
Line weaver Burk plot, (c) Hanes Woolf plot. Data are taken from an 
individual experiment and were confirmed in an independent repeat study. 
Several within day repeats giving similar results were also carried out for 
most drug concentrations.
(Table 6.1) the results have also been presented in units of menadione activity to 
compensate for these small between day variations observed (Table 6.2). The results 
in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 are means of pooled data taken from both within-day and 
between-day repeats. Due to limited amount of compound, between-day repeats were 
not always carried out at the listed concentrations.
Results displayed in Table 6.1 show that structural modification of AZQ resulted in 
an altered rate of DT-diaphorase catalysed metabolism. At a concentration of 400 
(A M , the methyl analogue was the most rapidly reduced of the 7 compounds examined 
whereas /so-propyl was the most poorly metabolised. The relative order of DT- 
diaphorase catalysed metabolism was methyl > rc-butyl > iso-butyl > / 2-propyl > ethyl 
(AZQ) > sec-butyl > iso-propyl. Only slight variations in order were obtained when 
expressing data in Units of menadione activity and when comparing values obtained 
at the 200 |iM concentration.
Experiments were carried out to examine the effect of hypoxia on the rate of 
metabolism of the parent compound AZQ at 50 and 25 j l iM  concentration. These 
showed no significant difference between aerobic and hypoxic conditions, the 
activities at 50 j l iM  AZQ being 14 and 16 nmoles cytochrome c reduced / minute / mg 
protein respectively.
6.4 Discussion
The aims of the experiments presented in this chapter were to investigate AZQ 
metabolism catalysed by highly purified DT-diaphorase isolated from rat Walker 
tumour cells and to determine the effect of structural modification on this reduction 
process. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that AZQ acted as a substrate for 
the Walker cell DT-diaphorase (Fig 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4). At a substrate concentration of 
100 |iM activity was -5 fold higher than that achieved with the prototype 
bioreductive alkylating agent mitomycin C which has been suggested to be activated 
by DT-diaphorase (Siegel et al,  1992). AZQ was however -30 fold more poorly 
metabolised than E09 and -180 fold more poorly metabolised than the conventional 
substrate menadione (Chapter 3). As with E09, structural modification of AZQ was 
found to significantly alter its ability to act as a substrate for DT-diaphorase (Table
6.1 and 6.2).
128
As discussed in Chapter 3, of a number of methods available for monitoring DT- 
diaphorase metabolism of quinone compounds the cytochrome c reduction assay was 
considered preferable for our requirements.
Controls carried out where either drug or cofactor were omitted resulted in an 
extremely low level of activity. Exclusion of enzyme did however give a fairly high 
background activity indicating that the compounds could be reduced directly by the 
NADH cofactor. This is in contrast to results obtained by Siegel and co-workers 
(1990a) who reported a negligible non-enzymatic loss of quinone under both aerobic 
and anaerobic conditions. These authors did however use a 10 fold lower 
concentration of NADH. In addition, the experiments where negligible background 
was reported were carried out by direct UV spectrophotometry which may not be as 
sensitive as the cytochrome c reduction assay. Assuming that dicoumarol did not 
interact with the drugs and that it was acting purely as an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, 
it would be expected that the activity in the presence of dicoumarol would be 
identical to that obtained in the absence of enzyme. In fact for all analogues the 
background in the absence of enzyme was similar if not slightly higher than that in 
the presence of dicoumarol. This further supported the fact that dicoumarol was 
totally inhibitory of enzyme activity at the concentration employed (100 jiM). 
Although there are a number of problems associated with using the inhibitor 
dicoumarol (Chapter 3) these are unlikely to apply here since a highly purified 
preparation of DT-diaphorase was used.
In contrast to the situation with E09 and its analogues (Chapter 3), examination of the 
progress curves (Fig 6.2) revealed a brief but significant initial lag phase in the case 
of certain analogues. This was particularly noticeable for sec-butyl and iso-butyl 
AZQ. There was however no difference observed between reactions initiated by 
enzyme, drug or NADH. Following the lag phase the reaction proceeded in a linear 
fashion.
The rate of reduction of the aziridinylbenzoquinones was dependent on enzyme, drug 
and cofactor concentration. The NADH concentration of 2 mM employed in these 
experiments was optimum for all substrates with the exception of sec-butyl AZQ 
which showed increasing activity with up to 10-20 mM cofactor. Increasing drug 
concentration resulted in an enhancement in activity, the only exception again being 
the sec-butyl analogue which exhibited decreased activity above 400 pM drug 
concentration. It is likely however, that this reduced activity was a result of the 
limited solubility of the sec-butyl analogue. The lack of
129
substrate saturation observed for most analogues would imply a high Km value. This 
is consistent with previous findings with AZQ utilising rat hepatic DT-diaphorase 
(Siegel et al , 1990a). These authors have also subsequently examined metabolism of 
the aziridinylbenzoquinone analogues by the purified rat liver enzyme (Gibson et al , 
1992). They did not however discuss either the effect of increasing drug 
concentration on the rate of reaction or the Km values obtained with the analogues. 
Results presented in this chapter demonstrated a lack of linearity for Hanes Woolf 
plots suggesting that the aziridinylbenzoquinones do not in general conform to 
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and thus no Km values could be determined.
Experiments indicated that, in general, the compounds exhibit linearity with respect to 
enzyme concentration over a range of 0.02-0.1 |ig / ml of protein, with increasing 
concentration leading to enhanced activity. Repeat experiments are however required 
to confirm this observation. For most assays 0.1 jig / ml of protein was employed as 
this was the lowest concentration to give a reasonable rate of reduction. It may have 
been preferable to utilise higher concentrations of enzyme, particularly for the 
investigation of some of the poorer substrates where activity was very low with 0.1 
|ig of DT-diaphorase / ml of reaction mixture. However, this would have consumed 
very large amounts of purified enzyme and the results were considered sufficient for 
the necessary conclusions to be drawn.
Since the aziridinylbenzoquinones do not tend to conform to Michaelis-Menten 
kinetics activities were compared at two drug concentrations (200 and 400 pM) and 
were expressed in both units of menadione activity as well as mg of protein for the 
reasons previously described (Chapter 3). The order of activity of the analogues was 
largely similar when 200 pM drug concentration to that obtained with 400 pM . The 
results obtained for 400 pM aziridinylbenzoquinones will be discussed as these 
involved a greater number of repeats. The order of activity for this concentration 
when expressed in mg of protein was, from most to least active, methyl > «-butyl > 
iso-butyl > «-propyl > ethyl (AZQ) > sec-butyl > iso-propyl. Converting these results 
to units of menadione activity merely reversed the order of the methyl and rc-butyl 
and «-propyl and iso-butyl analogues. Similar studies carried out by Gibson and co­
workers (1992) who found an order of reduction by rat hepatic DT-diaphorase of 
methyl > «-butyl > ethyl (AZQ) > iso-butyl >n-propyl >sec-butyl >iso-propyl. 
Although this sequence does vary slightly from that obtained from the experiments 
described in this chapter, the overall trend is very similar. It is possible that the 
differences may be due to the different source of enzyme employed between the two 
studies, i.e. rat liver versus rat Walker tumour. The advantage of using the purified
130
rat Walker tumour enzyme was that a direct comparison was possible between the 
rate of reduction catalysed by this enzyme and cytotoxicity in the cell line from which 
the enzyme was derived (see Chapter 7).
The one-electron reduction potentials (E^) determined by pulse radiolysis range from 
-44 for the methyl analogue to -167 for the iso -butyl derivative. The other 
aziridinylbenzoquinones are intermediate between these two extremes and assume the 
following order: methyl > AZQ > n-butyl > n-propyl > iso-propyl > sec-butyl > iso- 
butyl (Dzielendziak and Butler, 1989). Two-electron reduction potentials are thought 
to follow a similar trend to the one-electron reduction potentials (Swallow, 1982) and 
thus the possible ease of reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase should also be 
predictable from the one-electron reduction potentials. In fact no direct correlation 
can be seen between the rate of reduction of the analogues by DT-diaphorase (Table 
6.1) and the one-electron reduction potentials. This is consistent with results obtained 
by Gibson co-workers (1992) with purified rat hepatic DT-diaphorase. Furthermore 
other investigators have similarly reported a lack of correlation between one-electron 
reduction potentials and DT-diaphorase metabolism of a range of quinone compounds 
(Brunmark et al,  1988; Buffington et al,  1989). In addition to the electron reduction 
potential other factors will influence the ability of a compound to undergo 
metabolism catalysed by the enzyme which may explain the lack of correlation 
observed. Lipophilicity as well as steric factors may be important, in particular the 
substrate fit in to the active site of DT-diaphorase.
Cytochrome c reduction assays were carried out to examine the effect of hypoxia on 
the reduction of AZQ by DT-diaphorase. No apparent difference was observed 
between the rates of metabolism obtained under aerobic verses hypoxic conditions. 
These data compare well with those obtained by Siegel and co-workers (1990a) using 
purified rat hepatic enzyme. They m onitored NADH oxidation 
spectrophotometrically and found similar initial rates of cofactor utilisation under 
aerobic and hypoxic conditions, although AZQ removal was more rapid under 
anaerobic conditions (5.6 and 3.5 nmol / minute / (ig for anaerobic and aerobic 
conditions respectively). This suggested that in the presence of air the hydroquinone 
formed by reduction was rapidly auto-oxidised to regenerate the quinone. They also 
found that at pH 7.8 the rate of re-oxidation of AZQH2  was higher.
To conclude, data presented in this chapter provide clear evidence that the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones related to AZQ are able to undergo metabolism catalysed by 
rat Walker tumour cell DT-diaphorase. The somewhat unusual enzyme kinetics have
131
been documented. The rate of reduction varies depending on the structural 
modification made. This may have implications for the cytotoxicity of the 
compounds and hence their therapeutic efficacy. This will be discussed in the 
following chapter.

Chapter 7
Cytotoxicity of Aziridinylbenzoquinones
7.1 Introduction
The cytotoxicity of aziridinylbenzoquinones, particularly of diaziquone or AZQ, in 
vitro  has been fairly well documented. A number of these findings have been 
summarised in Table 7.1. AZQ is highly cytotoxic under aerobic conditions with 
IC50 values as low as 0.1 |iM being reported in the K526 leukaemic cell line. It is 
however difficult to draw detailed quantitative comparisons between the 
cytotoxicities reported in the numerous cell lines due to variations in exposure times, 
parameters quoted (i.e. IC 50 and IC 90) and methods employed. What is however 
evident, is that cytotoxicity varies to quite a large extent between cell lines and 
depends on the exposure time as well as the technique used.
Structural modification of AZQ has also been found to alter cytotoxicity. For 
example BZQ (a derivative in which the carboethoxyamino groups of AZQ have been 
replaced by ethanolamine moieties) has a 43 fold greater toxicity than AZQ in the 
L1210 murine leukaemic cell line (Lea et al , 1988). Also for a series of analogues 
where the carboethoxyamino group has been replaced by a variety of other moieties a 
large range of cytotoxicities were observed (De Mol et al,  1988).
Several studies have indicated that reduction of AZQ may be necessary for the 
generation of cytotoxic species. Cytotoxicity of AZQ in the CHO Chinese hamster 
ovary cell line was increased following incubation with the chemical reducing agent 
ascorbate (O'Brien et al,  1990). An indication of the importance of enzymatic 
reduction in the cytotoxicity of AZQ came from experiments using the HT29 human 
colon carcinoma cell line. These studies revealed that dicoumarol, an inhibitor of 
DT-diaphorase, decreased the cytotoxicity of AZQ and thus implicated this enzyme in 
the activation of the aziridinylbenzoquinone (Siegel et al,  1990a). Further evidence 
for the involvement of DT-diaphorase in the activation of AZQ was provided by the 
observation that the HT29 cell line, which expresses high levels of the enzyme, was 
more sensitive to AZQ than the BE human colon carcinoma line, which has a 
mutation in the NQOl gene and as a result does not express a functional form of the 
enzyme (Siegel et al,  1990a).

As previously discussed (Chapter 1), AZQ has the potential to act as a bioreductive 
alkylating agent and as such may be selectively toxic towards hypoxic cells. In one 
study a 3-4 fold increase in cell kill was observed under hypoxic verses aerobic 
conditions for the CHO AA8-4, Chinese hamster ovary cell line (O'Brien et al,  1990). 
In these experiments oxygen concentrations below 0.6 mmHg were more effective in 
enhancing toxicity than those above 0.6 mmHg. Rauth and Marshall (1990), 
however, have pointed out that it is between 0.6 mmHg and 6 mmHg oxygen where 
radiation sensitivity initially falls. Thus from the point of view of complementing 
radiation therapy, an ideal hypoxic cell cytotoxin would exhibit selective cell kill 
below 6 mmHg oxygen concentrations. Other investigators claimed no effect of 
hypoxia on the cytotoxicity of AZQ in the CHO cell line, although in fact a 2.3 fold 
decrease was observed (Powis et al,  1987). In addition, a study in C3H mice has 
shown no selectivity for hypoxic cells in the 16/C mouse mammary carcinoma in vivo  
(Tannock, 1983).
Results presented earlier in this thesis (Chapter 6) have shown that the series of 
aziridinylbenzoquinone analogues synthesised by Dr John Butler and co-workers 
(Patterson Institute, Manchester, UK) differed in their ability to be metabolised by 
DT-diaphorase (Chapter 6). Given this information and that bioreduction has been 
implicated in the activation of AZQ, it was of interest to determine whether the 
cytotoxicity of these analogues towards rat Walker tumour cells was related to their 
ability to be metabolised by DT-diaphorase purified from the same cell line. It was 
hoped that this would clarify the role played by DT-diaphorase in the bioactivation of 
aziridinylbenzoquinones and may elucidate structural features that were important in 
this process.
7.2 Methods
7.2.1 Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Testing
Rat Walker UK 256 Sensitive tumour cells were employed to examine the 
cytotoxicity of the aziridinylbenzoquinones in order to compare results with data 
obtained from metabolism studies which used enzyme purified from these cells. 
Walker 256 tumour cells were cultured routinely as described previously (Chapter 2).
134
Cell viability was assessed by means of the MTT dye reduction assay carried out in 
the presence and absence of the DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol. The method 
was essentially identical to that outlined in detail in Chapter 2. Briefly, Walker 
tumour cells were seeded in microtitre plates at a density of 5 x 103  cells / ml and 
were treated with varying concentrations of drug. Following a standard 72 hour 
exposure period plates were analysed by the MTT assay for cell viability. For assays 
where dicoumarol was included it was desirable to select the highest sub-cytotoxic 
dose of inhibitor which was in general 5 pM. However in some experiments this was 
found to have a small cytotoxic effect and therefore 1  pM was also employed. 
Dicoumarol was added to the cells 30 minutes before drug treatment and was left on 
during the 72 hour exposure to the aziridinylbenzoquinone. Results were calculated 
as absorbance as a percentage of the appropriate vehicle control. This was 0.2% 
DMSO (final concentration) in the case of drug alone and either 5 pM or 1  pM 
dicoumarol plus 0.7% DMSO (final concentration) for the inhibitor-containing 
treatments. Initial MTT assays were carried out in Cambridge with some experiments 
repeated in Sutton. However, the results were generally very similar from both 
laboratories. Where all analogues were not analysed during the same experiment care 
was taken to ensure that a standard was included, which was generally AZQ itself. 
Most of the equipment used in both laboratories was identical as was the original 
source of the cells. Microtitre plates used in Sutton were obtained from Nunclon 
(Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK) rather than Falcon. However the results 
obtained did not vary to any appreciable extent between experiments carried out in 
the two laboratories. A limited supply of a number of the analogues permitted only 
duplication of the dicoumarol inhibition studies.
For dicoumarol inhibition studies the dose modification factors were determined for 
each individual experiment using the formula:
Dose modification factor (DMF) = ICso Drug + Dicoumarol
IC5 0  Drug alone
7.2.2 Clonogenic Assay
A preliminary experiment was carried out on the Walker Sensitive and Walker 
Resistant cells to determine the cloning efficiency following exposure to AZQ. The 
method is identical to that previously described in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.
135
7.3 Results
The aziridinylbenzoquinones related to AZQ exhibited highly potent cytotoxicity 
when applied to rat Walker UK 256 tumour cells (Table 7.2). The mean IC5 0  values 
for all analogues examined fell within a relatively narrow range, from 15 to 44 nM. 
The ranking for cytotoxicity was «-propyl AZQ = / 50-butyl AZQ > sec-butyl AZQ = 
methyl AZQ > «-butyl AZQ > AZQ > iso-propyl AZQ (in decreasing order of 
potency). Variation between the repeat IC5 0  values obtained was small with standard 
errors ranging from 0.004 to 0.015 (Table 7.2). Typical concentration-response 
curves of the seven aziridinylbenzoquinones are shown in Fig 7.1. The shape and 
steepness of these curves were very similar for the different analogues.
D icoum arol was observed to m odulate the cytotoxicity of the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones in a protective fashion (Table 7.3). In most cases the degree 
of protection against cytotoxicity obtained with 1  pM dicoumarol was less than that 
obtained with 5 jiM dicoumarol, the exception being iso-butyl AZQ. At 5 pM 
concentration the average DMF varied from 1.65 to 3.02 across the range of 
analogues. Structural modifications did not appear to greatly influence the DMF 
(Table 7.3). The concentration - response profiles are shown in Fig 7.2. In all cases 
the curve where dicoumarol is included lies to the right of that of the drug alone 
indicative of a protective effect of dicoumarol on the toxicity of the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones.
A preliminary experiment examining the cloning efficiency of Walker Sensitive and 
Walker Resistant cells following exposure to AZQ revealed a large differential 
between the two cell lines. Fig 7.3 shows that the Walker Sensitive line is much 
more sensitive to AZQ than is the Walker Resistant. As previously discussed 
(Chapter 4, Section 4.3) is indicative of a bifunctional alkylating agent.
7.4 Discussion
The aziridinylbenzoquinones examined were all highly potent towards the rat Walker 
tumour cells (Table 7.2). Structural modification had only a fairly modest effect on 
cytotoxicity. The most cytotoxic of the analogues were the iso-butyl and n-propyl 
AZQ and the least potent was / 50-propyl AZQ (Table 7.2, Fig 7.1) with the difference 
between the two extremes being ~3 fold. During the course of the present work a 
similar series of compounds was analysed for cytotoxicity in human HT29 colon

carcinoma cells (Gibson et al,  1992) and the leukaemic K562, BSM, L I210 and RAJI
cell lines (Butler et al,  1990). The order of cytotoxicity obtained in these experiments
varied to some extent from data presented in this chapter using the Walker cell line.
However, broadly consistent with the present data, Gibson and co-workers reported
only a small degree of variation in potency between the analogues with iso-propyl
AZQ being the least toxic. Minor alterations in the order of cytotoxicity are
understandable in view of the fact that there were differences in both the species of
•
origin and nature of cell lines used as well as in the experimental conditions 
employed. Indeed, experiments with E09 analogues presented earlier in this thesis 
(Chapter 4) have shown differences in cytotoxicity between human HT29 cells and 
the rat Walker cell line with the latter being more sensitive. The cytotoxicity 
experiments reported in this chapter have used the MTT assay following a 72 hour 
drug exposure and IC 50 values were used for comparison. Those obtained by Gibson 
and co-workers (1992) were IC 90 values calculated from clonogenic assay with a 2 
hour exposure. Exposure time has been reported to be an important factor in 
determining the toxicity of aziridinylbenzoquinones. Around a 50 fold difference was 
observed in the ID 50 value for AZQ in the K562 leukaemic cells when drug 
incubation time increased from 1  hour to 5-7 days (Butler et al,  1990). In contrast 
O'Brien and co-workers (1990) have reported very little increase in toxicity between a 
24 hour and 7 day exposure in CHO AA8-4 cells.
Enzymology studies described earlier in this thesis (Chapter 6) revealed that purified 
rat Walker DT-diaphorase was able to reduce AZQ very efficiently and that structural 
modification significantly altered the rate of this metabolism. For this reason it was 
considered important to investigate a potential role for DT-diaphorase mediated 
metabolism in the activation of the aziridinylbenzoquinones to a cytotoxic species. 
An initial indication of such an involvement was obtained by comparing the 
cytotoxicity of the analogues in the rat Walker cell line with their ability to be 
metabolised by DT-diaphorase purified from the same cell line (Chapter 6). The 
more toxic iso-butyl and methyl analogues were amongst the more favourably 
metabolised whereas the least toxic compound iso-propyl AZQ was the most poorly 
reduced (when assayed at 400jiM concentration). This would support a role for DT- 
diaphorase in the reductive activation and cytotoxicity of the aziridinylbenzoquinones 
in the Walker cell line. Other analogues examined exhibited intermediate 
cytotoxicity and in most cases reduction rates were between these two extremes. 
Despite the overall correlation, the order does not equate precisely with either their 
ability to undergo DT-diaphorase metabolism or with their order of reduction as 
predicted from one-electron reduction potentials (see Chapter 6). The results obtained
137
are similar to the overall correlation reported during the course of this work by 
Gibson and co-workers (1992). Although finding a different order of toxicity they 
also saw no absolutely precise correlation with either DT-diaphorase reduction or 
one-electron reduction potentials. It should be emphasised that they compared 
cytotoxicity in human HT29 colon carcinoma cells with reduction by a purified rat 
hepatic enzyme. Previous studies using CB 1954 (Boland et al,  1991) and E09 
(Walton et al,  1991 and Chapter 3 of this thesis published in Bailey et al,  1992) have 
reported differences in metabolism by the rat and human enzyme. Within the cell a 
number of additional factors will influence cytotoxicity including drug uptake and 
efflux as well as levels of activating and protective enzymes which may vary in their 
affinities for different substrates. For this reason we would not necessarily expect a 
perfect correlation between DT-diaphorase reduction and cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, 
given the relatively narrow range of cytotoxicities and enzyme reduction rates seen 
with the range of AZQ analogues used, the overall correlation was quite reasonable 
and supportive of a role for DT-diaphorase in the activation mechanism.
To clarify further the role of DT-diaphorase metabolism in the cytotoxicity of the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones the DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol was included in 
some of the cytotoxicity assays. The data obtained illustrated that dicoumarol, when 
applied at a sub-cytotoxic concentration, was able to modulate the toxicity of the 
compounds towards rat Walker cells to a modest extent (up to 3 fold) (Table 7.2). 
The level of modulation observed was however consistent with that obtained using 
menadione in hepatocytes (Thor et al,  1982) and C 3H /10Ti/2 mouse embryo 
fibroblast cells (Atallah et al,  1987). In general dicoumarol decreased the cytotoxicity 
exerted by the aziridinylbenzoquinones thus implicating DT-diaphorase in the 
activation of these compounds (Fig 7.2). Although the protective effect appears quite 
modest, similar degrees of protection were observed when 20 pM dicoumarol was 
applied to HT29 cells (Gibson et al 1992). An exception to this observation was the 
n-butyl analogue which exhibited a 6 fold protective effect in the HT29 cell line 
(Gibson et al,  1992). Interestingly this analogue also manifested the highest degree (3 
fold) of protection in the Walker cell line in the present experiments (Table 7.3). This 
greater modulation of cytotoxicity in the presence of dicoumarol would suggest that 
DT-diaphorase activation of n-butyl AZQ is more heavily involved in the cytotoxic 
mechanism of the compound. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that 
rc-butyl AZQ was the most efficiently metabolised of all the analogues by both the 
purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase (Chapter 6) and rat hepatic DT-diaphorase 
(Gibson et al,  1992).
138
As in the case of E09, the chemistry of the aziridinylbenzoquinones would suggest 
various possible mechanisms of cytotoxicity including oxidative stress following 
redox cycling, alkylation and drug free radical damage. The differential toxicity 
observed between the Walker Resistant and Sensitive cell lines would imply that 
AZQ could act as a bifunctional alkylating agent (Fig 7.3). Indeed, examination of a 
number of cell lines following exposure to AZQ has revealed the presence of both 
DNA interstrand cross-links and strand breaks (Szmigiero et al,  1984; King et al,
1984) with the nature and extent of these two types of damage varying greatly 
between different cell lines. Cytotoxicity has been correlated with the formation of 
interstrand cross-links but not of strand breaks (Szmigiero et al,  1984). Evidence of 
DNA-protein cross-links in CHO-K1 cells treated with AZQ has also been reported 
(King et al,  1984). In addition they found more rapid repair of strand breaks than of 
cross-links in this cell line.
Experiments using chemical reducing agents have indicated that reduction may 
enhance cytotoxicity of AZQ in intact cells (Section 7.1). Indeed in cell free systems 
a number of authors have reported that either chemical reduction (Szmigiero and 
Kohn, 1984; King et a l , 1984; Gutierrez et al,  1986; Butler et al,  1989) or enzymatic 
reduction (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a and b) is required for the induction of DNA 
damage. A recent publication by Lee and co-workers (1992) has reported an increase 
of DNA interstrand cross-links induced by these aziridinylbenzoquinones following 
reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase. Further evidence has come from the detection 
of the semiquinone, the one-electron reduced metabolite, in intact cells by ESR as 
well as following reduction by purified enzymes (Egorin et al,  1985; Gutierrez et al,  
1986; Lea et al,  1988; Butler et al,  1990; Dzielendziak et al,  1990). The 
semiquinone radical is potentially a DNA damaging species and has been implicated 
in the toxicity of AZQ (King et al,  1984). Some authors report a lack of correlation 
between semiquinone radical detection and cytotoxicity (Lea et al,  1988) although 
later reports suggest that this may be due to efflux of this metabolite from the cell 
(Butler et al,  1989). The precise nature of the cytotoxic species is as yet unclear and 
may vary between cells.
It is possible that both hypoxia and pH may influence the cytotoxicity of the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones. The few publications that have documented the effect of 
hypoxia on AZQ cytotoxicity have shown a minimal effect in vitro  and in vivo  
(Powis, 1987; O'Brien et al,  1990; Rauth and Marshall, 1990). For this reason and the 
limited amount of compounds available the effect of oxygen concentration was not 
examined in this study. Decreasing the pH increases AZQ-induced DNA damage
139
(e.g. Szmigiero and Kohn, 1984; King et al,  1984; De Mol et al,  1988) as well as that 
of the analogues reported in this chapter following reduction by DT-diaphorase (Lee 
et al,  1992). The effect of pH could in theory be due to either an effect on DT- 
diaphorase or alternatively a direct activation of the aziridines.
To summarise, reductive activation has been implicated in the cytotoxicity of AZQ 
and the use of cell free systems has permitted identification of enzymes which may be 
involved in this process. Those enzymes implicated to date include NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase and DT-diaphorase. The experiments reported in 
Chapters 6 and 7 of this thesis provide further evidence for the metabolism of 
aziridinylbenzoquinones by DT-diaphorase. In addition they indicate that this 
reduction process may be an important factor in determining the cytotoxicity of the 
compounds. The incomplete protection of toxicity conferred by dicoumarol would 
suggest additional involvement of other activating enzymes. However the problems 
of using this inhibitor and the caution required when interpreting results has been 
discussed in detail in Chapter 3. Structural modification of AZQ clearly plays a role 
in the ability of the aziridinylbenzoquinones to be metabolised by DT-diaphorase and 
in their cytotoxicity. The data obtained would suggest a greater importance for DT- 
diaphorase in the activation of the w-butyl analogue but that it may be less relevant for 
other compounds such as /so-propyl and sec-butyl AZQ which are poorer substrates.
Despite the relationship between DT-diaphorase metabolism and cytotoxicity the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones are likely to exert their toxicity through a variety of 
mechanisms which may involve different metabolites. The particular mechanism of 
activation and cytotoxicity will depend on the chemistry of the individual analogue as 
well as the levels of activating and protective enzymes present in the various cell 
types.

Discussion
Over the years the field of cancer chemotherapy has seen significant advances in the 
treatment of specific tumours. Cancer does however remain a major cause of 
mortality world-wide emphasising a need for innovative new drug development. 
Traditional, empirical methods of drug discovery are now being superseded by more 
rational approaches which exploit new, potentially more selective targets. It is hoped 
that this change of strategy will result in the identification of novel agents which 
possess an enhanced therapeutic index over those compounds currently available.
Solid tumours are largely incurable by radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy. 
This is thought to be at least in part due to the presence of resistant hypoxic cell 
populations (Coleman, 1988). Hypoxia does however provide a selective target for 
bioreductive anticancer agents which are prodrugs that undergo metabolism to 
generate oxygen-sensitive cytotoxic metabolites (Workman and Stratford, 1993). In 
addition some solid tumours have been shown to express increased levels of certain 
reducing enzymes involved in activation of these compounds, thus providing a second 
level of selectivity (Workman and Walton, 1990).
DT-diaphorase has been reported to be capable of both activating and detoxifying 
quinone compounds and to have increased levels and activity in a number of solid 
tumours when compared with normal tissue of the same origin (Riley and Workman, 
1992b). For these reasons the work in this thesis was designed to investigate a role 
for DT-diaphorase in the activation and cytotoxicity of bioreductive anticancer agents. 
The investigation has focused on two classes of compound: the novel indoloquinones 
related to E 09 (Oostveen and Speckamp, 1987) and aziridinylbenzoquinone 
analogues of AZQ (Dzielendziak and Butler, 1989; Dzielendziak et al,  1990). Results 
of studies carried out previously had suggested that both E09 (Walton et al,  1991 and 
1992) and AZQ (Siegel et al,  1990a) could undergo metabolism catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase although at the outset of this project there had been no publications 
documenting reduction of analogues.
The initial aims of the work were therefore firstly to confirm that DT-diaphorase 
could catalyse metabolism of these categories of bioreductive anticancer agents and
141
secondly to determine their cytotoxic potency. This latter property could then be 
correlated with the ability to undergo reduction in an attempt to determine whether 
DT-diaphorase-catalysed metabolism represented a major activation or detoxification 
process.
Quinones may undergo one-electron reduction catalysed by a variety of enzymes such 
as cytochrome P450 reductase to generate the corresponding semiquinone radical (see 
review by Powis, 1989). These radicals are in general highly oxygen sensitive and 
under aerobic conditions are auto-oxidised to generate the parent quinone. Further 
rounds of reduction and oxidation then occur in a process known as redox cycling 
with the concomitant generation of oxygen radicals. These latter species may cause 
DNA damage in the form of strand breaks, in addition to a multitude of other effects 
which lead to a potentially lethal condition known as oxidative stress. In the absence 
of air the semiquinone is likely to be stabilised and further reduced to generate the 
hydroquinone. For a number of standard quinones (e.g. menadione) the hydroquinone 
is more readily conjugated (e.g. to the sulphate or glucuronide) and subsequently 
eliminated and is therefore less toxic than the semiquinone radical (Buffington et al,
1985). DT-diaphorase catalyses two-electron reduction of quinones to generate the 
hydroquinone directly, thus bypassing the toxic radical-producing reactions. For this 
reason it is often considered to be a detoxification enzyme under aerobic conditions. 
However, some quinone compounds have two-electron reduced metabolites which are 
also highly oxygen sensitive and may participate in redox cycling. In addition a 
number of compounds possess substituents such as the aziridine moiety and / or 
leaving groups which following reduction to either the semiquinone or the 
hydroquinone are activated to alkylating species. Thus for these compounds two- 
electron reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase as well as one-electron reduction, by 
for example NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase, may lead to activation rather than 
detoxification. Mitomycin C, the prototype bioreductive alkylating agent, is one such 
compound (Ross et al,  1993). It contains an aziridine group which, after reduction, is 
activated to an alkylating moiety capable of producing an initial monoadduct; 
following that further rearrangement results in a crosslink in the minor groove of 
DNA. This is thought to be a major mechanism of mitomycin C induced cytotoxicity. 
The structure of E09 is based on that of mitomycin C and it was therefore considered 
likely that its mechanism of cytotoxicity would also involve DNA damage. The 
quinone group confers the ability for redox cycling and radical production whereas 
the aziridine moiety and two leaving groups on the sidechains permit activation to an 
alkylating agent. An additional aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate DNA 
damage as a possible mechanism of cell kill of E09. By using cell free systems the
142
involvement of particular enzymes such as DT-diaphorase in this process could be 
elucidated. Equivalent studies to determine the mechanism of AZQ induced 
cytotoxicity were performed during the course of this work (Siegel et al , 1990a).
The ability of DT-diaphorase to metabolise bioreductive agents was determined 
primarily by the highly sensitive spectrophotometric, cytochrome c reduction assay 
which was selected for the reasons discussed in Chapter 3. HPLC and 
spectrophotometric monitoring of the direct loss of cofactor were also employed to 
further confirm findings. Results showed that DT-diaphorase present in sonicates of 
both rat Walker and human HT29 colon carcinoma cells could catalyse metabolism of 
E09 very efficiently. Data compared well with those obtained by Walton and co­
workers (1991) using Walker tumour cell preparations and with preliminary findings 
of these authors using the HT29 cell sonicates (Walton et al,  1992b). In order to 
determine the extent of activity attributable to DT-diaphorase the widely used reagent 
dicoumarol was included as an inhibitor. It should be noted however that this 
compound has subsequently been found to also inhibit a number of other enzymes 
including xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase (Gustafson and Pritsos, 1992b), 
carbonyl reductase (Wermuth, 1981), NADH cytochrome b 5 reductase (Hodnick and 
Sartorelli, 1993) and is therefore less specific than was originally thought. A purified 
form of rat Walker DT-diaphorase was therefore used to provide unambiguous 
evidence and to determine kinetic parameters. Studies with sonicates of tumour cells 
may however provide valuable information not obtainable with a purified enzyme 
system. They may more closely reflect the natural environment within the cell and 
allow examination of drug reduction by a particular enzyme in a situation where 
competing enzymes are also present. For these reasons the metabolism of E09 was 
compared with both purified DT-diaphorase and enzyme-rich sonicates.
Data obtained with E09 using tumour cell sonicates suggested that the rat Walker 
cells were more efficient than the human HT29 cells in terms of E09 reduction. This 
would either indicate that the rodent enzyme was more active than human DT- 
diaphorase or that DT-diaphorase was present at higher concentrations in the rat cells 
per mg of protein than in human HT29 cells. As discussed in Chapter 3 further 
experiments are required to clarify this issue by a direct comparison of rat and human 
enzyme preparations. This issue is currently being addressed by Dr. A. Lewis in our 
laboratory using recombinant rat and human DT-diaphorase produced in E.coli.  
Results of these experiments suggest that the rat form of the enzyme is approximately 
7 times more active than the human form with regard to E09 reduction (Lewis et al,  
1994). Similar quantitative differences in activity between the rat and human forms
143
of DT-diaphorase have previously been reported for the dinitrophenyl aziridine 
compound CB 1954 (Boland et al,  1990). This has been suggested to be the reason 
for the high therapeutic index of CB 1954 in rodent tumours in contrast to the 
apparent lack of activity in a human clinical trial.
Work carried out in this thesis using purified rat Walker enzyme confirmed that both 
E09 and AZQ were able to act as excellent substrates for DT-diaphorase. Activity 
was only 2-5 fold poorer than the conventional substrate menadione in the case of 
E 09 and -200 fold poorer for AZQ when considering Vmax values. Both 
compounds were far more efficiently metabolised than the prototype bioreductive 
agent mitomycin C. During the course of this work Siegel and co-workers (1990) 
also reported that purified rat hepatic DT-diaphorase was able to catalyse metabolism 
of AZQ.
In the case of E09, HPLC data confirmed that purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase was 
able to catalyse reduction of the compound and also indicated that a highly oxygen 
sensitive metabolite was formed. Further evidence for the generation of an oxygen 
sensitive metabolite came from ESR studies where both oxygen radicals and a drug- 
based radical, almost certainly the semiquinone, were detected when E09 was 
incubated under aerobic conditions with DT-diaphorase in the presence of cofactor. 
Similar results also from ESR experiments had previously been obtained for AZQ 
(Siegel et al,  1990a; Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a). Thus it appears that DT- 
diaphorase may catalyse reduction of both E09 and AZQ to their corresponding 
hydroquinone form which is then auto-oxidised in the presence of molecular oxygen 
to the parent quinone via the semiquinone intermediate. Other possibilities are that 
DT-diaphorase catalyses two-electron reduction by rapid successive one-electron 
reduction steps which are nevertheless detected by ESR, or alternatively that 
comproportionation : disproportionation reactions are occurring.
Bioreductive agents are designed to have specificity for hypoxic tumours. Studies 
carried out in our own laboratory and by others have shown increases in cytotoxic 
potency of both E09 (Hendriks et al,  1993; Plumb and Workman, 1994; Robertson et 
al, 1994; Plumb et al,  1994a and b) and AZQ (O'Brien et al,  1990; Rauth and 
Marshall, 1990) under hypoxic compared with aerobic conditions. As DT-diaphorase 
may be involved in the activation of E09 to a cytotoxic species the influence of 
hypoxia on the rate of DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of E09 was investigated. 
Results obtained using purified rat Walker tumour DT-diaphorase showed that the 
initial velocity for reduction of E09 occurred at an identical rate in the presence and
144
absence of air as detected by the cytochrome c reduction assay. Assays with AZQ 
revealed similar findings. Other investigators have reported that the initial reduction 
of mitomycin C (Siegel et al,  1990b), CB 1954 (Knox et al,  1988a) and AZQ (Siegel 
et al,  1990a) is similarly unaffected by oxygen. Nevertheless, due to the oxygen 
sensitivity of the DT-diaphorase metabolites it is likely that the oxygen status of the 
tumour will influence the cytotoxicity of E09 by affecting the stability of these 
species, despite the oxygen-independence of the initial reduction rate.
In addition to being hypoxic, tumours have been considered in the past to be acidic in 
nature. This has however been open to controversy and current opinion suggests that 
whereas extracellular pH may be slightly acidic due to increased lactic acid 
production the intracellular pH of the tumour remains well regulated (Griffiths et al,  
1991; 1993). Modification of pH has been shown to affect DT-diaphorase-mediated 
reduction of mitomycin C (Siegel et al,  1990b; Keohane et al,  1990) and also the 
cytotoxicity of E09 (Phillips et al,  1992) and mitomycin C (Kennedy et al,  1985). It 
should be noted that the pH may affect the stability of the quinone prodrug before 
reduction and thus alter its ability to act as a substrate and the nature of the metabolite 
produced following drug reduction. For example low pH may lead to protonation of 
the aziridine ring which may enhance its activation to an alkylating moiety and 
increase its cytotoxic potency, independently of enzyme activation. In addition, the 
pH of the cell may directly affect the enzyme, thereby modifying its catalytic ability. 
Due to the possible relevance of pH to drug activation within tumours, the effect of 
pH on DT-diaphorase metabolism of E 09 was examined. Using the 
spectrophotometric cytochrome c reduction assay no difference in the rate of 
metabolism was observed over the pH range 5.8 to 7.8 with E09. Interestingly, no 
effect was seen in our experiments with mitomycin C using this assay system. Siegel 
and co-workers (1990b; Ross et al,  1993) proposed that the quinone methide is the 
metabolite formed by DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction of mitomycin C and that 
this alkylates the enzyme, thereby inactivating it. Under acidic conditions this may be 
converted to 2,7-diaminomitosene which is released from the enzyme-substrate 
complex thus permitting further metabolism. It is likely that the short time course of 
the spectrophotometric assay does not permit enzyme inactivation to be detected and 
thus no benefit of decreasing pH was observed. In contrast, Siegel and co-workers 
(1990b) measured the production of metabolites by HPLC after more prolonged 
incubation. This difference could be tested by preincubating mitomycin C with 
NADH and the enzyme before measuring reduction rate in the cytochrome c reduction 
assay.

Structural modification of compounds often leads to alteration of a number of 
characteristics including their cytotoxicity and ability to be metabolised. It is 
therefore important to determine the structure-activity relationships of anticancer 
compounds in order to improve drug design for increased cytotoxicity and selectivity. 
This may be particularly useful in the so-called 'enzyme-directed' approach to drug 
development (Workman and Walton, 1990; Workman, 1992a; Workman, 1994) by 
enabling optimisation of drug structure to suit the catalytic preferences of key 
bioreductive enzymes. A number of analogues of both E09 and AZQ were made 
available to us. For both classes of compound, structural modification was found to 
alter the rate of DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction. In the case of the indoloquinone 
analogues too few compounds were analysed to give any conclusive structure-activity 
relationships but certain important observations can be made nevertheless. It does for 
example appear that the aziridine ring-opened form of the compound E05A is very 
poorly metabolised by DT-diaphorase. Similar results have been reported for CB 
1954 (Knox et al , 1988b). This suggests that the aziridine function may undergo a 
desirable interaction with the active site of DT-diaphorase. E07, the analogue where 
the aziridine ring is replaced by a methoxy group was however only 2-fold less active 
a substrate for DT-diaphorase than was E09 itself when considering Vmax values. 
This indicated that possession of an intact aziridine was not a structural requirement 
for activation catalysed by this enzyme. In contrast, E08 which possessed a modified 
aziridine ring in the form of a methyl aziridine was 15-20 fold more poorly 
metabolised than E09. Interestingly, altering the hydroxyl leaving group of E09 to a 
carbamate in the case of EO 88 led to an increase in rate of reduction. As regards the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones, analogues available for study exhibited modifications of the 
side chain rather than the aziridine group. Little difference was observed between the 
ability of these analogues to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase and thus 
no clear structure-activity relationships were evident. The order of activity at a 
concentration of 400 pM compound was, from most to least active, n-butyl > methyl 
> iso-butyl > «-propyl > ethyl (AZQ) > sec-butyl > iso-propyl. This order differed to 
only a small extent from that obtained during the course of this work with the purified 
rat hepatic enzyme by Gibson and co-workers (1992).
One of the properties which might potentially affect the rate of reduction of quinones 
is the redox potential. When comparing the half-wave (E|^) reduction potentials 
provided for the indoloquinones with the order of DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction 
no direct correlation was observed. Similarly the one-electron reduction potential of 
the azirdinylbenzoquinones did not directly follow their ability to undergo DT- 
diaphorase reduction. In the latter case reduction potential was expressed as an E ^
146
rA oc^-jnoiv \ »ca ffC-CAirC o o c )  •
value determined by pulse radiolysis. This is believed to be £ more reliable measure 
of reductive capacity than Ej£. It might be argued that it would have been more 
correct to compare DT-diaphorase catalysed reduction with two-electron reduction 
potentials. On the other hand, DT-diaphorase catalyses two rapid but sequential one- 
electron reduction steps, and so it could equally well be argued that the one-electron 
reduction step is in fact appropriate. In practice the two-electron reduction potentials 
were not available; moreover, the one and two-electron reduction potentials are 
thought to follow a similar trend. A lack of correlation with reduction potential has 
been reported by other authors for aziridinylbenzoquinones (Gibson et al,  1992), 1,4- 
napthoquinones (Buffington, 1989) and quinone epoxides (Brunmark, 1988). It 
should be pointed out, however, that the reduction potentials of both E09 and AZQ 
analogues were within a fairly narrow range (E1 /^ values of -367 to -380 for the 
indoloquinones and E ^  values ranging from -44 to -161 for the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones) and it is possible that an effect might have been seen had a 
broader range of values been studied. Nevertheless it does seem likely that the 
reduction of quinones by DT-diaphorase is much less redox-dependent than more 
classical one-electron reducing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase 
(Workman, 1994). In addition other properties are likely to be important such as 
lipophilicity and steric factors including in particular substrate fit into the active site 
of the enzyme. Thus we can conclude that in future drug design related to DT- 
diaphorase, electron reduction potentials may not be an important consideration 
providing they do not vary beyond the range studied here, while the rate of reduction 
can still be modified by changing the pendant groups in relatively subtle ways. Thus 
the 'enzyme-directed' bioreductive drug design approach is particularly suited to DT- 
diaphorase.
The cytotoxic potency of the indoloquinones and aziridinylbenzoquinones was 
determined by the MTT dye reduction assay. In the case of the indoloquinones the 
results were confirmed by other techniques. The human HT29 colon carcinoma and 
rat Walker mammary tumour cell lines were selected for analysis because of their 
high expression of DT-diaphorase and the fact that they were the source of enzyme 
for the metabolism studies described in this thesis. E09 was found to exhibit highly 
potent cytotoxicity in both the HT29 and Walker cell lines compared to that shown by 
a number of other commonly used anticancer drugs in both these and other cell lines. 
This level of cell kill is consistent with reports of other investigators for E09 in HT29 
cells (Hendriks et al,  1993; Phillips et al,  1992; Plumb and Workman, 1994; 
Robertson et al,  1994; Van Ark-otte, 1994). Results presented in this thesis also
147
showed AZQ to act as a highly potent cytotoxin to the Walker cell line although these 
particular cells were more sensitive to E09.
As for DT-diaphorase metabolism, modifying the structure of E09 led to alteration of 
cytotoxic potency in both HT29 and Walker cells. Structural modification also 
resulted in a slight alteration in the cytotoxic potency of the azirdinylbenzoquinones 
in Walker cells. For the indoloquinones the variation between IC 50 values for the 
analogues was fairly large. This ranged from 15 nM for E09 to >326 |iM for E05A 
(the aziridine ring opened metabolite) in HT29 cells and from 46 pM for E09 to 1.43 
pM in the case of E07 (the analogue where the aziridine of E09 has been replaced by 
a methoxy group) in the Walker cells. In contrast the IC 50 values of the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones were more similar to each other with the iso-butyl and n- 
propyl analogues being most toxic, having an IC 50 value of 15 nM, and the iso-propyl 
analogue being least toxic with an IC 50 value of 44 nM. This finding was consistent 
with data obtained during the course of this work by Gibson and co-workers (1992) 
using the HT29 cell line.
Determination of both DT-diaphorase-catalysed reduction rates and cytotoxicity for 
the same analogues allows the relationship between the two parameters to be assessed. 
Interestingly, analogues which were more efficiently metabolised by DT-diaphorase 
were in general the more toxic; for example the indoloquinones E09 and EO 88 (the 
analogue with a carbamate leaving group in place of the side-chain hydroxyl group of 
E09) were the most rapidly metabolised and the most cytotoxic whereas the more 
poorly metabolised analogue E05A  was the least toxic. Similarly for the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones methyl and iso-butyl AZQ were efficiently metabolised and 
exhibited greater toxicity whereas the least toxic analogue iso -propyl AZQ was 
amongst the more poorly metabolised. This would support a potentially important 
role for activation of these agents by DT-diaphorase. These data are again consistent 
with findings of Gibson and co-workers regarding the aziridinylbenzoquinones 
(1992). The cytotoxic potency of compounds is however unlikely to be solely a 
reflection of reductive capacity but will be influenced by the levels of other activating 
and protective enzymes within the cell as well as by physico-chemical factors such as 
solubility and lipophilicity.
A property which may well be affected by structural modification is the extent of 
reaction with DNA, either before or after enzymatic activation. The aziridine moiety 
is generally considered to confer alkylating ability following activation and therefore 
to increase cytotoxicity of quinone bioreductive agents. This moiety remained
148
unmodified in the aziridinylbenzoquinones analysed. In the case of the 
indoloquinones, analogues possessing this group were in general the more potent 
whereas E05A, the aziridine ring-opened compound, was ~ 21,000 times less toxic in 
the HT29 cell line. This clearly supports the involvement of the aziridine group in the 
mechanism of toxicity. A few compounds such as E07 were however exceptions, 
lacking the aziridine but retaining a considerable degree of potency, but not so great 
as with E09 itself. Interestingly a difference in sensitivity to some indoloquinone 
compounds but not others was observed between the rat Walker and human HT29 cell 
line. It is possible that this may reflect different mechanisms of cytotoxicity of the 
various analogues. Walker cells are known to be particularly sensitive to difunctional 
alkylating agents and thus compounds which have an increased cytotoxic potency in 
this cell line may cross-link DNA. Alternatively, it may involve interspecies 
differences in structural preferences of DT-diaphorase. Clearly it is possible that the 
aziridine group is favoured because it encourages both efficient metabolism and also 
is involved in DNA interactions. In order to test these hypotheses and to draw further 
deductions regarding structure-activity relationships additional analogues need to be 
examined. The results described here do, however, provide a useful lead into this area 
of investigation.
Results of structure-activity relationship studies presented in this thesis (Bailey et al , 
1992) provided the first evidence to link cytotoxic potency of the indoloquinones with 
their ability to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase. Further indication of 
the im portance of D T-diaphorase in the activation of both the 
aziridinylbenzoquinones and indoloquinones came from comparisons of the 
sensitivity of two human colon carcinoma cell lines to these agents. E09 was 15 to 
30-fold more toxic to HT29 cells which express high levels of DT-diaphorase than to 
BE cells which do not possess a functional form of this enzyme because of a point 
mutation in the NQOl gene (Walton et al,  1992a; Plumb and Workman, 1994). 
Similarly AZQ showed a 2 fold differential between the two cell lines at 80% cell kill 
(Siegel et al,  1990a). HT29 and BE cells exhibit similar levels of other activating 
enzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase (Siegel et al,  1990a) but differ in their 
expression of the DNA repair enzyme 06-alkyl guanine alkyl transferase. However, 
this is unlikely to affect their sensitivity to E09 as discussed previously in Chapter 4 
of this thesis. Subsequently, a number of studies have been carried out by various 
laboratories on panels of human and rodent cell lines where the levels of DT- 
diaphorase and other bioreducing enzymes have been correlated with sensitivity to 
E09. Robertson and co-workers (1992) found a link between the cytotoxic potency 
of E09 and its ability to undergo metabolism catalysed by DT-diaphorase in 15
149
human tumour cell lines derived from breast, lung and colon. This study was later 
updated (Robertson et al,  1994) to include additional human cell lines as well as 8 
rodent cell lines. The correlation was still retained. Experiments carried out by the 
Bradford (UK) group at around the same time (Collard and Double, 1992; Phillips et 
al, 1992) again indicated a link between DT-diaphorase and activation of E09, as did 
those of Plumb and co-workers (1994a; 1994b), Smitskamp-Wilms et al  (1994) and 
the NCI-Glasgow collaboration (Hendriks et al,  1993; Pauli et al,  1994; Fitzsimmons 
et al,  1994)
In order to help clarify a possible involvement of DT-diaphorase in the cytotoxic 
mechanism of indoloquinones and aziridinylbenzoquinones the enzyme inhibitor 
dicoumarol was included in toxicity assays. Only a small degree of modulation was 
noted, as observed also by Gibson and co-workers (1992) with the 
aziridinylbenzoquinone analogues. Interestingly the data presented in Chapter 7 of 
this thesis and those reported by Gibson and colleagues show a more significant 
modulation of n-butyl AZQ cytotoxicity by dicoumarol than is the case for the other 
analogues. Notably, this was also the compound most rapidly metabolised by rat 
Walker DT-diaphorase (Chapter 6) and the rat hepatic enzyme (Gibson et al,  1992). 
This appears to confirm the view that DT-diaphorase may be equally important in 
activation of the more efficiently metabolised analogues such as n-butyl AZQ but is 
less important for others. There are however a number of problems associated with 
use of dicoumarol in cytotoxicity studies, as discussed in Chapter 4. Hence data 
obtained using this inhibitor should not be relied upon too strongly . Another 
approach could be to carry out cytotoxicity assays on cell lines such as HT29 
following addition of various enzyme inducers. It is however likely that this would 
give co-induction of other enzymes, resulting in difficulty in dissecting out specific 
changes due to DT-diaphorase. A more favourable alternative approach to answer 
this question would be to transfect a cell line expressing low levels of DT-diaphorase 
with the cDNA for the enzyme under the transcriptional control of a specific inducible 
promoter. Sensitivity of the cell line to the agents could then be examined following 
selective induction of DT-diaphorase.
The chemistry of E09 suggests that its mechanism of cytotoxicity may involve DNA 
damage. Additional support for this hypothesis came from experiments described in 
this thesis on the cytotoxicity of indoloquinones against the Walker cell lines sensitive 
and resistant to bifunctional alkylating agents. These cell lines showed a differential 
toxicity towards E09 and EO 8 8, a feature which is commonly diagnostic of 
interstrand cross-links (Knox et al,  1991). EO 88 differs from E09 only in the
150
substitution of one of its hydroxyl leaving groups with a carbamate moiety and thus, 
like E09, bears three potential alkylating sites when activated which could in theory 
form cross-links with DNA. As a result of the indication that these two 
indoloquinones were able to induce DNA interstrand cross-links, the extent of DNA 
damage induced by cytotoxic concentrations of E09 in whole cells was investigated 
by the technique of alkaline elution. Walker cells which possess high levels of DT- 
diaphorase were found to contain both DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links 
following treatment with E09. Visualisation of the cross-links by alkaline elution 
required dose optimisation. This involved 4 repeat applications of E09 at 4 hourly 
intervals followed by a further 12 hour incubation, probably permitting repair of 
strand breaks and accumulation of less readily repaired interstrand cross-links. This 
finding may have important clinical implications if DNA damage is confirmed to be 
responsible for E09-induced cell kill. DNA interstrand cross-links have often been 
considered to be a more toxic form of DNA damage than single strand breaks. Thus it 
is possible that an increase in tumour cell kill may be achieved by administering the 
drug by continuous infusion or multiple doses rather than by a single high dose 
regimen. This proposal requires further investigation using in vivo  tumour models.
The ESR experiments presented in this thesis (Chapter 3) have shown that the 
reduction of E09 by DT-diaphorase generated both oxygen radicals and a drug-based 
radical, both of which have the potential to cause DNA strand breaks. It is therefore 
likely that the DNA damage detected in DT-diaphorase rich Walker cells treated with 
E09 is due to DT-diaphorase activation of this compound. This possibility was 
further investigated in the present work using the DT-diaphorase proficient and 
deficient human colon carcinoma cell lines HT29 and BE. Results showed that both 
DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links were induced in HT29 cells at a dose 
of E09 which corresponded to the IC50 value. Interestingly this concentration was 
non-toxic to BE cells (Plumb and Workman, 1994) and caused no detectable damage 
to their DNA (this thesis). Increasing the concentration of E09 to an equipotent 
concentration (i.e. the IC 50 of E09 in BE cells) resulted in the detection of DNA 
damage in these cells also. Thus the presence and extent of DNA damage appeared to 
correlate very well with cytotoxicity of E09 in the human colon carcinoma cell line 
pair, consistent with the view that it may be an important mechanism of cell kill. The 
higher doses required to induce both cytotoxicity and DNA damage in the BE cells 
were also consistent with the importance of DT-diaphorase in the production of DNA 
damaging lesions. Because of the large hypoxic differential observed in BE cells 
(Plumb and Workman, 1994) experiments were also carried out under hypoxic versus 
aerobic conditions. Under hypoxia levels of DNA damage in both BE and HT29 cells
151
also showed a correlation with cytotoxicity. It was hypothesised in Chapter 5 that the 
cytotoxic, DNA damaging species may therefore be either a one-electron reduced 
metabolite such as the semiquinone stabilised under hypoxia or alternatively the two- 
electron reduced product. The latter could be formed by either direct two-electron 
reduction in cells possessing DT-diaphorase or by two sequential one-electron 
reduction steps in cell lines such as BE which lack a functional form of this enzyme.
DNA damage experiments using whole cells are highly informative as they give data 
regarding the mechanisms of cytotoxicity in a more physiologically relevant system 
where a variety of enzymes are present. Inhibitor studies could be employed to 
investigate the role of a particular enzyme in drug activation to a DNA damaging 
species. However, in the case of DT-diaphorase this was not considered advisable 
due to the pleiotropic effects of dicoumarol discussed previously. For this reason cell 
free assays were used to determine the potential involvement of DT-diaphorase in 
activation of E09 to metabolites capable of inducing strand breaks and interstrand 
cross-links in plasmid DNA.
Data presented in Chapter 5 showed that E09 was activated by DT-diaphorase under 
aerobic conditions to a strand breaking species in a dose-dependent manner. These 
results compared well with those obtained previously by Walton and co-workers 
(1991) in the same system. Experiments using superoxide dismutase and catalase 
have also provided evidence implicating oxygen radicals as the causal species of the 
strand breaks observed under the aerobic conditions used. In addition, preliminary 
experiments investigated the effect of hypoxia on strand break formation. Results of 
these studies also showed E09 to induce strand breaks under hypoxia but rather 
surprisingly a substantial degree of protection of this damage was observed when 
superoxide dismutase and catalase were included in the assays. These enzymes 
should remove oxygen radicals from the system and the results therefore suggest that 
damage observed was due to either a small amount of residual oxygen within the 
apparatus or due to auto-oxidation of the metabolites during loading of the reaction 
mixture on to the gel. Evidence in support of the latter was provided by the 
observation that the purple colour of the E09 solution was restored rapidly upon 
introduction of air into an enzyme system which had previously metabolised E09 to 
colourless metabolite(s) under anoxia. Because of the potential problems with 
reoxidation, these hypoxia experiments were not pursued further. It should be 
emphasised however that there was a component of the DT-diaphorase-catalysed 
DNA strand break capablity that was not protected by superoxide dismutase and
152
catalase. This indicates that DNA damage can be due in part to the release of E09 
reduction products catalysed by DT-diaphorase.
The ability of DT-diaphorase to activate E09 to a bifunctional alkylating agent 
capable of inducing interstrand cross-links in DNA was also examined using a cell 
free plasmid, agarose gel-based assay. Results of these studies confirmed that E09 
could cause cross-links in DNA following aerobic reduction catalysed by DT- 
diaphorase at physiological pH. In the absence of activation no cross-links were 
detectable. This supports the view that DT-diaphorase may be one of the enzymes 
involved in activation of E09 to a cytotoxic, DNA cross-linking species in the intact 
cell.
Studies with AZQ described in this thesis and those from other investigators have 
indicated a similar mechanism of DNA damage to that caused by E09. AZQ is 
reduced by DT-diaphorase (Chapter 3 and Siegel et al,  1990a). This generates oxygen 
radicals and a drug-based radical (Fisher and Guttierez, 1991a), presumably by auto­
oxidation of a highly oxygen sensitive two-electron reduced metabolite. Following 
treatment with AZQ, HT29 cells showed evidence of DNA damage in the form of 
both interstrand cross-links and strand breaks whereas DNA damage was not detected 
in BE cells (Siegel et al,  1990a). This again suggested a role for DT-diaphorase in 
activation of AZQ to a DNA damaging species. In addition the strong correlation 
between DNA damage and cytotoxicity supported the view that this may be a 
mechanism of AZQ-induced cell kill. Experiments involving cell free systems have 
confirmed that AZQ could be activated by DT-diaphorase and NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase to species causing strand breaks (Fisher and Guttierez, 1991a).
In addition to strand breaks and interstrand cross-links, other types of DNA damage 
may be formed by alkylating agents including DNA monofunctional adducts. 
Reaction with DNA can occur at different bases and can also be DNA sequence- 
dependent. In order to more fully understand this DNA damage at a molecular level, 
a highly sophisticated Taq polymerase assay was employed. This permitted the 
sequence selectivity of E09 binding to DNA to be determined. Results with this 
assay, presented in Chapter 5, showed that E09 was able to form covalent DNA 
adducts in the absence of activation. This was presumably due to the instability of the 
aziridine ring in the close proximity of strong nucleophilic sites on DNA. Binding 
was, as for many other alkylating agents, predominantly with guanine residues 
particularly where they occurred in runs of consecutive guanines. This is believed to 
be due to the high electronegativity of these sequences (D’Incalci, 1992). However,
153
the precise sequence dependence was different from that obtained with the 
conventional nitrogen mustard chlorambucil which was included as a standard. Both 
the number of nucleotides alkylated and the extent of modification was reduced with 
binding being more slightly more specific for certain guanines. In particular, it was 
noted that of the all the adenines in the sequence GCA within the readable part of the 
sequencing gel were alkylated more strongly by chlorambucil than by unactivated 
E09. This suggested that E09 was, possibly for steric reasons, unable to bind to this 
particular series of bases. Only one adenine was more strongly alkylated by E09 than 
chlorambucil, that being in the sequence GTATC (base pair number 515 in pBR322 
DNA). Other bases which were modified by E09 but not chlorambucil included two 
cytosines in the sequence GCA and three incidences of cytosine in the sequence pu pu 
C pu (where pu denotes purine). Interestingly, where DT-diaphorase was included in 
the reaction mixture the degree of DNA binding was decreased, regardless of whether 
the NADH cofactor was included. The reasons for this phenomenon are unknown. It 
is possible that when E09 is bound to the enzyme this reduces its availability to 
interact with DNA. This may be to some extent an artefact of the model system used. 
Of greater potential importance was the observation that, in the presence of both DT- 
diaphorase and NADH cofactor, the spectrum of E09 adducts produced was found to 
differ from those formed in the absence of an activating system. In general, this 
involved loss or decreased extent of alkylation compared with the unactivated drug, 
with binding being more specific. Guanines were the most common base for which 
this occurred. A few bands were however present following activation that were not 
evident with either unactivated drug or chlorambucil. Four of the changes noted were 
cytosines with two of these being in the sequence TGC (positions 562 and 566). Only 
one adenine was noted to have increased alkylation with the sequence CAT (position 
491). Two incidences of thymine modification were also detected. Further distinct 
differences between E09 and reduced forms were clearly visible in a region of the gel 
which was poorly resolved for technical reasons and in which it was therefore difficult 
to determine the sequence. In addition to the possible sequestration of E09 by the 
DT-diaphorase molecule mentioned earlier additional suggestions put forward in 
Chapter 5 to explain the decreased alkylating in the presence of DT-diaphorase 
included DNA cross-link formation restricting further monofunctional alkylation and 
strand break induction causing artifactual results. Such altered specificity following 
enzymatic activation has been observed by other investigators with the bioreductive 
quinone alkylating agents DZQ (3,6-diaziridinyl-l,4-benzoquinone) and methyl-DZQ 
(2,5-dimethyl-3,6-diaziridinyl-l,4-benzoquinone). It is hoped that such sequence- 
selective DNA interactions could lead to selective antitumour activity (Hartley, 1990).
154
Studies examining the inhibitory effect of dicoumarol on E09-induced cytotoxicity 
suggested a role for DT-diaphorase in E09 activation but indicated that other 
enzymes may also be involved. The one-electron reducing enzyme NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase has been reported to be involved in the activation of a 
number of bioreductive agents including mitomycin C (Bachur et al , 1979; Pan et al , 
1994) and AZQ (Fisher and Gutierrez, 1991a). For this reason experiments were 
carried out to determine the possible importance of this enzyme in E09-induced 
cytotoxicity. Results from ESR experiments provided the first evidence for the ability 
of NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase to metabolise E09. In addition, they showed 
that under aerobic conditions this reduction generates both a drug-based radical and 
oxygen radicals. These were similar in nature to those produced following E09 
reduction by DT-diaphorase. Similarly, DNA damage assays indicated that these 
oxygen radicals are able to induce DNA strand breaks. Thus it appears that NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase may also be involved in the activation of E09 in intact 
cells. Due to time limitations further investigations with NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase were not performed, but it would be interesting to evaluate the role of this 
enzyme in comparison with DT-diaphorase.
In summary, data presented in this thesis have shown that both E09 and AZQ acted as 
potent cytotoxins whose mechanism of cell kill was likely to involve DNA damage. 
The experiments have provided important information to understand the nature of 
E09 bioreductive metabolism, particularly with regard to the involvement of DT- 
diaphorase. From these data a scheme for the mechanism of activation and action of 
E09 has been postulated (Fig 8.1). In this scheme DT-diaphorase reduces E09 to 
form a colourless metabolite which is relatively stable under hypoxic conditions. This 
is likely to be the two-electron reduced metabolite, the hydroquinone. In the presence 
of molecular oxygen this species undergoes auto-oxidation to generate a drug-based 
radical (presumably the semiquinone) and ultimately the parent quinone. Reactive 
oxygen radicals are generated concomitantly during this process. NADPH: 
cytochrome P450 reductase also catalyses reduction of E09 to generate the same 
metabolite as that formed by auto-oxidation of the two-electron reduced metabolite. 
Thus it is likely that under aerobic conditions two-electron reduction of E09 catalysed 
by DT-diaphorase and also one-electron reduction by NADPH: cytochrome P450 
reductase will both generate a drug-based radical, thought to be the semiquinone, as 
well as oxygen radicals. In addition the hydroquinone may be generated either by 
direct by two-electron reduction or two sequential cycles of one-electron reduction. It 
is likely that in an intact cell, under aerobic conditions, the spectrum of metabolites 
ultimately formed will depend on the levels of oxygen and proximity of strong

Fig. 8.1 Postulated mechanism of activation and action of E09
nucleophiles. Under hypoxia the product of DT-diaphorase metabolism appears to be 
stabilised and the drug and oxygen radicals would be less likely to be formed. 
Similarly one-electron reduction catalysed by enzymes such as NADPH: cytochrome 
P450 reductase under hypoxia should produce a stabilised semiquinone and could 
even undergo further cycles of one-electron reduction to generate the hydroquinone. 
A further complication is that, in addition, the semiquinone and hydroquinone may 
both be formed by comproportionation :  disproportionation reactions.
DNA damage appears to be a major mechanism by which E09 causes cytotoxicity. 
Strand breaks are induced which are likely to be due to oxygen radicals formed during 
redox cycling. Following reduction the aziridine and leaving groups present on the 
side chains are likely to undergo activation to form alkylating moieties capable of 
causing DNA interstrand cross-links. The identity of the reactive metabolite 
responsible for DNA cross-links is unknown. On chemical grounds cross-links could 
be formed from either the semiquinone or hydroquinone. Hypoxic DNA damage 
experiments may clarify this issue.
Concluding Remarks
The initial aims outlined at the beginning of this thesis have largely been fulfilled. 
Inevitably the results obtained have raised new questions which remain to be 
answered by further research. The data presented have strongly indicated a role for 
DT-diaphorase in the bioreductive activation and cytotoxic mechanism of E09. 
Experiments have however to some extent relied on use of the DT-diaphorase 
inhibitor dicoumarol which is now known to exert pleiotropic pharmacological 
effects. Other authors have warned that caution should be taken when interpreting 
results obtained using this compound (Workman and Walton, 1989; Ross et al,  1993). 
For this reason the ability of DT-diaphorase to metabolise both the indoloquinones 
and aziridinylbenzoquinones was confirmed using a purified form of the enzyme 
derived from rat Walker tumour cells. Experiments have however indicated that the 
rat and human DT-diaphorase enzymes differ in their ability to metabolise certain 
compounds such as E09 and CB 1954 (Chapter 3 and Boland et al,  1991). An 
understanding of these metabolic intricacies provides a basis for rational drug 
development. Analogues may be identified with enhanced reduction by the human 
tumour enzymes compared with the rat forms of DT-diaphorase. In the case of the 
indoloquinones, E08 acted as a slightly better substrate for DT-diaphorase present in 
sonicates of human HT29 cells than of rat Walker cells (Chapter 3). An analogue of 
CB 1954, 5-(aziridin-l-yl)-2,4-dinitro-l-isobutylbenzoate (CB 10-200), also showed
156
preference for the human enzyme (Lambert et al,  1992). This information also 
highlights the importance of using relevant model systems which will reflect the 
human in vivo  situation most closely. It would be favourable, in this instance, to 
screen compounds for activity using the purified human enzyme. This was however 
not available and is reported to be difficult to purify in quantity. In terms of the 
ultimate clinical relevance it would obviously be important to analyse the reduction of 
E 09 using a purified human enzyme. A good indication of the involvement of DT- 
diaphorase in the cytotoxicity of E09 towards human tumour cells has been provided 
by comparative studies of high and low DT-diaphorase expressing cell lines, such as 
HT29 and BE colon carcinoma cells (Plumb and Workman, 1994). DNA damage 
studies on these cell lines reported in this thesis are strongly supportive of the 
proposed mechanism. In addition, a number of studies have reported a clear 
correlation between DT-diaphorase expression and the aerobic cytotoxicity of E09 in 
larger panels of human tumour cell lines (Phillips et al,  1992; Walton et al,  1992; 
Robertson et al,  1992; Robertson et al,  1994; Plumb et al,  1994a and b; Smitskamp- 
Wilms et al,  1994; Fitzsimmons et al,  1994). The issue could however be further 
clarified using cell lines transfected with DT-diaphorase cDNA. Levels of this 
enzyme could then be regulated under the control of an inducible promoter.
Structural modification of E09 and AZQ resulted in an altered cytotoxic potency and 
ability to be reduced by DT-diaphorase. In general, the SARs for cytotoxicity and 
DT-diaphorase were similar, thus further supporting a causal role for DT-diaphorase 
in the cytotoxic mechanism. This information highlights the potential for tailoring of 
analogues to suit metabolism by key bioreductive enzymes as part of enzyme-directed 
drug development programmes (Workman and Walton, 1990; Workman, 1994). For 
the optimal structural requirements to be determined a wider range of analogues need 
to be analysed. Based on present work, such studies should include metabolism, 
cytotoxicity and DNA damage endpoints. E09 itself was based on the structure of the 
established bioreductive alkylating agent mitomycin C. Results presented in this 
thesis and elsewhere have shown that this novel indoloquinone agent exhibits 
important differences from mitomycin C, particularly in its increased ability to 
undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase, its preference for solid tumours versus 
leukaemias and importantly the fact that it does not induce dose-limiting 
myelosuppression.
The lack of complete inhibition of drug metabolism and cytotoxicity in the presence 
of dicoumarol suggested the involvement of additional enzymes in activation of 
indoloquinones. Experiments using NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase have
157
shown that this enzyme can also catalyse metabolism of E09 to generate DNA 
damaging metabolites under aerobic conditions. The role played by any one enzyme 
in the activation of the indoloquinones or aziridinylbenzoquinones will depend on the 
levels and affinities of other enzymes present in the cell. For this reason it is 
important that experiments are carried out to examine the metabolism of these 
bioreductive agents catalysed by other enzymes such as cytochrome P450, xanthine 
oxidase and dehydrogenase and carbonyl reductase amongst others. In addition, for 
an enzyme-directed approach to cancer treatment to be successful the 'enzyme profile 1  
of the tumour needs to be determined for each patient. With such information at hand 
it may be possible to tailor treatment for the individual by selecting drugs which are 
activated by enzymes expressed at high levels within a particular tumour. Ideally, 
such enzyme profiling would be conducted in parallel with measurement of the level 
of tumour hypoxia (e.g. see Rampling et al, 1994)
The importance of understanding the relative contributions of enzyme content and the 
level of hypoxia in a given tumour is highlighted by the recent observation that the 
role of DT-diaphorase in activation of E09 may differ under aerobic and hypoxic 
conditions (Plumb and Workman, 1994a and b; Robertson et al, 1994). These studies 
have shown that under aerobic conditions tumour lines rich in DT-diaphorase are the 
most sensitive to E09 but show very little increase in sensitivity under hypoxia; in 
contrast, cell lines with low DT-diaphorase activities are relatively resistant to E09 in 
air but exhibit a substantial increase in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. DNA 
damage studies on HT29 and BE cells described in this thesis are consistent with this 
pattern. It would be of particular interest to isolate and identify the metabolites 
formed under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions so that the cytotoxic species may 
be determined. This may prove difficult due to the apparent high reactivity of 
metabolites formed. As discussed previously, bioreductive agents are thought to be 
selective to hypoxic cells and / or those expressing increased levels of bioactivating 
enzymes. It is important that these agents are active against hypoxic cells which are 
resistant to radiation. This tends to be observed at an oxygen pressure of below 6 mm 
Hg. Many bioreductive agents currently available, e.g. mitomycin C, are most 
effective below 0.6 mm Hg oxygen and hence there are cells which will remain viable 
after combined therapy with mitomycin C and radiation. More encouragingly, one of 
the recently developed bioreductive agents, the benzotriazine di-N-oxide SR 4233, 
shows a more ‘suitable’  cytotoxicity profile over varying oxygen concentrations 
(Koch, 1993). The levels of oxygen present in cells should therefore be correlated 
with cytotoxicity in order to identify compounds effective over the desired range of 
oxygen tension. Nevertheless it is possible that compounds which do not completely
158
cover this window of hypoxic selectivity may still be effective due to a phenomenon 
known as the 'bystander effect'. This is a situation where cytotoxic metabolites 
generated within a cell are able to diffuse out and kill adjacent cells. However, this 
would require the metabolites produced on bioreductive activation to display the 
appropriate level of stability to facilitate sufficient but not excessive, diffusion.
With regard to the relative importance of the DT-diaphorase activities versus the 
extent of hypoxia in tumours under physiological conditions, it will be important to 
assess the contribution of these two parameters in vivo,  for example using human 
tumour xenografts.
Clinical trials of E09 are presently underway. As discussed above the ideal situation 
ultimately would be to tailor drug treatment depending on the characteristics of an 
individual patients tumour both in terms of enzyme profile and levels of hypoxia. 
This does however require further elucidation of the enzymology of these 
bioreductive anticancer agents. In the meantime it may be informative to take 
biopsies of tumours prior to treatment and carry out enzyme profiling on these 
specimens in order to determine whether enzyme status relates to response to E09 
therapy in the clinic. Such data may throw light on the involvement of particular 
enzymes in E09 activation in humans in vivo.
Currently, results obtained by Plumb and co-workers (1994) and Robertson et al  
(1994) would suggest that in vitro  DT-diaphorase may be important in activation of 
E09 under aerobic conditions but that under hypoxia the situation is reversed. If 
these relationships hold true in vivo  the patients which also benefit most from E09 
treatment would be those with either hypoxic tumours containing low levels of DT- 
diaphorase or those with high DT-diaphorase levels and low hypoxia.
The data presented in this thesis contributes to the 'enzyme directed approach' to 
bioreductive drug development adopted by our laboratory (Workman and Walton, 
1990; Workman, 1994). The results have enhanced our understanding of the 
mechanisms of both enzymatic activation and DNA damage of E09, from the whole 
cell down to molecular level. The importance of DT-diaphorase in the metabolism of 
both indoloquinones related to E09 and aziridinylbenzoquinone analogues of AZQ 
has also been confirmed. Information gained from this study and other similar 
investigations may be important either for improved analogue development and / or 
for optimisation of clinical protocols employing bioreductive anticancer agents.

Appendix 1
A 1.1 Introduction
A series of cyclopropamitosenes (Fig A l.l) have recently been synthesised by
O 'Professor C. Moody and Dr N.^Sullivan at Loughborough University, UK in an 
attempt to investigate the involvement of the C-10 group in alkylation. The 
compounds are structurally related to mitomycin C but possess a cyclopropane group 
in place of the aziridine ring at the Cl position, thus reducing the electrophilicity at 
this site. In theory one or two-electron reduction of the cyclopropamitosenes 
followed by elimination of the carbamate moiety could generate a powerful 
electrophile capable of alkylating DNA. It is also possible that radical-induced 
opening of the cyclopropane may occur producing a highly reactive radical which 
may cause strand breaks in DNA by extracting.hydrogen .
A
The in vitro  cytotoxic potency of two of the lead compounds the 7- 
methoxycyclopropamitosene (RB 91007X) and the 7-aziridinylcyclopropamitosene 
(RB 91008X) has been determined by Drs I. J. Stratford and M. Stephens at the MRC 
Radiobiology Unit, Harwell, UK using V79 lung fibroblasts (Moody et al,  1994). RB 
91008X was found to be highly toxic compared to many other agents against V79 
cells, with an IC 50 value of 3 nM under aerobic conditions. This was 1000 fold more 
potent than RB 91007X (IC 50 3 pM). For comparison, mitomycin C and E09 were 
intermediate between these two extremes. The sensitivity of cells to RB 91007X 
increased 25 fold when experiments were carried out under hypoxia but no effect was 
observed with RB 91008X. These results suggested that the two compounds may 
differ in their mechanism of activation, with RB 91007X being metabolised by an 
oxygen-sensitive process and RB 91008X by an oxygen-insensitive one. Since DT- 
diaphorase reduction has generally been considered to be independent of oxygen, the 
involvement of this enzyme in the activation of the two cyclopropamitosenes was 
investigated by including the DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol in cytotoxicity 
assays. The results indicated that DT-diaphorase may be important in the activation 
of RB 91008X but not of RB 91007X. To complement the cytotoxicity studies and to 
provide more definitive evidence of the possible involvement of DT-diaphorase, 
experiments described in this appendix were designed to directly investigate the 
ability of DT-diaphorase to metabolise the cyclopropamitosenes.

A 1.2 Methods
DT-diaphorase-catalysed metabolism of the two lead cyclopropamitosene compounds 
RB 91007X and RB 91008X, together with 7 structurally related analogues (Fig 
A 1.1) was determined spectrophotometrically by the cytochrome c reduction assay 
described in Chapter 2. Due to the limited amount of drug and enzyme available the 
experiments were restricted and between-day repeats were not performed. Activity 
was in general determined at 50 pM drug concentration using two low dilutions of 
DT-diaphorase (0.008 jig and 0.05 jig in a total reaction volume of 1  ml) although 10 
pM drug was also employed in some cases. Higher concentrations (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 pi 
/ ml of reaction buffer) of enzyme were used only for the lead compounds RB 
91007X and RB 91008X. Reduction of RB 91007X and RB 91008X was confirmed 
directly by monitoring oxidation of cofactor at 340 nm. Controls were carried out 
where each reaction component was omitted. The restraints on enzyme availability 
resulted in dicoumarol inhibition studies being performed on all compounds except 
for the lead analogues RB 91007X and RB 91008X.
The cyclopropamitosenes were kindly donated by Professor C. Moody 
(Loughborough University). These were diluted in DMSO and were used freshly 
where possible. Alternatively stocks were maintained frozen at -20°C, aliquotted to 
avoid freeze thawing.
A 1.3 Results
Results obtained using the cytochrome c reduction assay showed that the two lead 
compounds RB 91007X and RB 91008X (Fig A l.l) could undergo metabolism 
catalysed by purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase in the presence of cofactor (Table 
A l.l). RB 91008X was metabolised approximately three fold more efficiently than 
was RB 91007X with activities of 4.64 x 10 3 and 1.60 x 10 3 nmoles of cytochrome c 
reduced / minute / mg protein respectively (Table A l.l). Assays where reduction was 
monitored directly following a change in absorbance at 340 nm confirmed that RB 
91007X and RB 91008X could act as substrates for DT-diaphorase, as well as the 
relative rates of metabolism (Fig A1.2). Using the cytochrome c reduction assay 
incubations containing enzyme and cofactor alone resulted in some reduction. Both 
cofactor and the cyclopropamitosenes absorb at around 340 nm, thus it is not possible 
to quantify reduction of either compound by monitoring change in absorbance at this 
wavelength. Controls where cofactor or enzyme were omitted resulted in either no or

very low levels of activity. RB 91007X showed a non-linear progress curve with an 
initial sharp increase in absorbance followed by a more linear progress curve when 
change in absorbance was plotted against time (minutes). Activity was therefore 
calculated from the linear portion of the curve.
Although with menadione and E09 as substrates the preparation of DT-diaphorase 
used had been confirmed to be linear with respect to increasing enzyme 
concentrations (data not shown) a deviation from linearity was observed with RB 
91007X and RB 91008X over the range 1-4 jig of protein.
For the additional analogues examined, DT-diaphorase activity was extremely low 
nearing the background level of activity for the assay. This was due to the small 
amount of enzyme which could be employed. It was therefore difficult to determine 
the efficiency of the cyclopropamitosenes as substrates for DT-diaphorase from the 
data obtained. Given more enzyme and compound a wider range of drug 
concentrations and higher enzyme concentrations could have been be used. It was 
possible however to conclude that none of the compounds were more efficiently 
metabolised than E09 which was run in parallel as a standard and positive control. 
Only two of the analogues (Fig A l.l) ^/28 and 3/42 had any reasonable levels of 
activity above background. For a DT-diaphorase concentration of 0.05 jig / ml and 
drug concentration of 10 pM, the activity seen with the analogues was about 5 fold 
lower than that obtained with E09.
A1.4 Discussion
DT-diaphorase has been implicated in the activation of both E09 (Chapters 1, 3 and 
4) and mitomycin C (for references see Chapter 1). The cyclopropamitosenes 
described in this thesis chapter possess a similar chemical structure to these 
compounds and thus it was possible that they may also be metabolised by DT- 
diaphorase.
Cytotoxicity experiments carried out in V79 cells with the two lead compounds (Fig 
A l.l) RB 91007X and RB 91008X suggested that they are highly potent cytotoxins 
which differ in their modes of activation. In contrast to RB 91008X, RB 91007X 
appears to be metabolised to oxygen-sensitive metabolites, thus showing enhanced 
toxicity under hypoxic conditions. Dicoumarol inhibition assays suggested a role for
162
DT-diaphorase in activation of the aziridinylcyclopropamitosene RB 91008X but not 
of the methoxycyclopropamitosene RB 91007X.
Experiments described in this appendix have shown that both RB 91007X and RB 
91008X are able to act as substrates for DT-diaphorase purified from rat Walker 
tumour cells. The aziridine analogue RB 91008X was 3 fold more efficiently 
metabolised than was RB 91007X, fitting in with the protection conferred by 
dicoumarol against its toxicity. Similar results have been observed with the 
indoloquinone compounds related to E09. The analogue E07 bearing a methoxy 
group in place of the aziridine ring of E09 was also able to act as a substrate for DT- 
diaphorase but was ~2 fold less efficiently reduced than was E09 itself. This 
supports the view that aziridine moieties may favour binding to DT-diaphorase (see 
Chapter 8). The aziridine-containing cyclopropamitosene was also found to be more 
cytotoxic towards V79 cells than was the methoxy compound (Moody et al,  1994). 
This characteristic also parallels results obtained with E09 where the parent 
compound was more cytotoxic than the methoxy analogue. This was considered to be 
due to either increased activation by DT-diaphorase and / or the fact that aziridines 
may function as potent alkylating groups (Chapter 4).
As noted in the methods section, dicoumarol was not included in assays performed on 
the lead compounds due to limited availability of drug and enzyme. In theory, with 
purified enzyme activity in the presence of dicoumarol the observed activity should 
be similar to that in the absence of enzyme. Control experiments where either 
cofactor or enzyme were omitted showed low background levels of activity. Where 
cofactor and enzyme were incubated alone in the absence of drug some activity was 
observed. This value was subtracted from the overall activity when calculations were 
made. The cytochrome c reduction detected was concluded to result from reduction 
of cyclopropamitosenes catalysed by DT-diaphorase in the presence of cofactor 
NADH.
This particular preparation of rat Walker DT-diaphorase had been confirmed to give a 
linear increase in reduction rate of menadione. Deviation from linearity was however 
detected with RB 91007X and RB 91008X. In addition an unusual result was 
obtained for the change in absorbance over time for RB 91007X. The reaction 
progress curve showed an initial high rate followed by a levelling off and then a more 
linear increase. Due to these irregularities, DT-diaphorase reduction of the 
cyclopropamitosanes was confirmed by directly monitoring the change in absorbance 
of drug and cofactor NADH during the reaction. As both drug and cofactor were
163
found to absorb at 340 nm it was not possible to determine kinetics from these 
experiments. A decrease in absorption was however noted at 340 nm for both RB 
91007X and RB 91008X where drug was incubated with cofactor in the presence of 
enzyme. In the absence of any one reaction constituent no change in absorbance was 
noted. This indicated that DT-diaphorase was able to metabolise the 
cyclopropamitosenes in the presence of cofactor. The more rapid decrease in 
absorbance over time of RB 91008X than RB 91007X confirmed that it was able to 
act as a more efficient substrate. Both RB 91007X and RB 91008X were however 
more slowly reduced than E09.
Several additional cyclopropamitosene analogues (Fig A l.l) were also analysed for 
their ability to undergo reduction catalysed by DT-diaphorase. Low levels of activity 
were seen for each of the compounds using the concentrations of DT-diaphorase that 
were available for the experiments. E09 which is known to act as a good substrate 
for DT-diaphorase was employed as a standard as well as the conventional substrate 
menadione. At the enzyme concentrations used menadione was found to be well 
metabolised by the purified rat Walker DT-diaphorase. E09 was far less efficiently 
reduced but measurable rates were seen. In order to draw firm conclusions regarding 
the relative ability of the cyclopropamitosenes to act as substrates for DT-diaphorase 
higher enzyme concentrations would need to be employed. What is clear is that all 
the compounds examined were poorer substrates than E09 but that 3/42 and 3/28 
were reduced only about 5 fold less efficiently than E09 using 0.05 |ig of DT- 
diaphorase in a total reaction volume of 1 ml.
To conclude, data presented in this appendix have demonstrated that purified rat 
Walker DT-diaphorase is able to catalyse metabolism of both cyclopropamitosenes 
RB 91008X and RB 91007X. The 7-aziridinyl analogue RB 91008X is metabolised 3 
times more efficiently than the 7-methoxy analogue RB 91007X. What is particularly 
striking about these results is that such a modest change in ability to act as a substrate 
for DT-diaphorase nevertheless produces a major shift in the extent of the 
enhancement of cytotoxicity by hypoxia and in the modulation of cytotoxicity by 
dicoumarol.
