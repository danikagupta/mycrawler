Abstract 
The leather fmishing industries consume great amounts of water and 
therefore, important producers of liquid effluents. Waste treatment is mostly 
limited to homogenisation and sedimentation, although in some cases 
chemical coagulation and sludge digestion is 
carried 
out. This is 
normally 
insufficient to comply with the existing legislation. 
Colour is one of the pollutants common to all these industries. This is a 
parameter normally difficult to eliminate and 
furthermore, 
greater restrictions 
in the legislation relating to the discharge of industrial residual effluents are 
being contemplated more and more. 
In this present work, ozone and ozone with hydrogen peroxide have been 
studied in order to determine which of them are more effective in the 
reduction of the colour present in the waters discharged by the leather 
finishing industries. 
1 Introduction 
The discharge of dyes in waste water is one of the biggest problems in the 
leather- finishing industries. Dye in the water does not allow light and 
oxygen to pass through and this as a consequence, disfavours the 
development of micro-organisms and biological treatment. 
Dye molecules are formed by one or more chromophore groups, (groups 
of atoms with unsaturated bonds which give colour to the molecule. There 
are around 12 types of chromophore groups, the most common being the azo

group that includes 60-70% of all the textile dyes produced; th~s is followed 
by the group type quinone [l] . 
Due to the fact that dyes are resistant to degradation, it follows that only 
a small amount is eliminated with activated sludge systems [2,3,4] or with 
different combinations of chemical, physical and biological processes 
[5-S]. 
The current tendency is to decrease the concentration of contaminant 
substances in industrial waste. Consequently, more and more controls are 
being established regarding the quality of discharged water, which in general 
makes the pre-treatment of the water necessary. 
1.1 Production process in a leather-finishing shoe factory 
Leather-finishing comprises a series of treatments to which the tanned leather 
is subjected to, so as to provide it with the properties required according to 
each market. In general terms, finishing comprises all the processes following 
tanning, that is; bleaching, scouring, dyeing, re-tanning and lubrication, 
treatment of surfaces with pigments and pestilents. 
The leather-finishing industries work use a system of production by 
charges, this enables the waste to be discharged in a discontinuous state. 
It has been estimated that the amount of water used by a leather 
finishing factory with a production of 1,000,000 kgs skins p.a. is 
approximately 15,000 
m31year. 
During the finishing process, an important 
quantity of water is consumed in the following stages; neutralisation (5.300 
m31year), 
dyeing (340 
m31year), 
lubrication (1014 
m31year), 
fixing (680 
m31year), 
final washing (6900 
m31year) 
and surface treatment (320 
m31year)[9]. 
The processes in which discharge of effluent liquids is produced are 
draining , neutralization, fixing, final washing, drying and treatment of the 
surface. Discharged together with the water, are those reactives used that 
have not been exhausted in the baths. 
1.2 Advanced oxydation treatment in the elimination of colour 
Much of the literature has characterized the reactivity of ozone toward 
several single-dye solutions- It has been shown that ozone possesses and 
excellent decolorizing capability and that the biodegradability of 
ozone- 
treated wastewater can be increased 
[10,11]. 
However, most of the 
wastewater from actual dye manufacturing and textile dyeing and finishing 
factories is composed of mixed-dye- solutions. The ozonation of a mixed-dye 
solution is considerably more complicated than of a single-dye solution. 
Ozone removes the 
color 
from textile wastewater by oxidizing or 
breaking up the complex compounds and chromophores that form dyes used 
to 
color 
natural as when as synthetic fibers and fabrics. The 
color 
is removed 
when the ozone cleaves the -C=C- bonds, the -N=N- bonds and 
heterocyclic and aromatic rings 
[12]. 
Some classes of dyes respond more 
readily to oxidation by ozone than others. The reactive dyes are degrades to

the greatest extend and ozonation is moderately successful in treating 
wastewaters containing 
sulfur, 
azonic and basic dyes. However, disperse dyes 
have poor response to ozone 
[13]. 
Ozonization for removal might be a promising process for the following 
reasons: (1) no chemical sludge is left in the treated effluent; (2) ozonation 
has the potential to accomplish both 
color 
removal and organic reductions in 
one step; (3) less space is required, and its is easily installed on site; (4) their 
is less danger, since no stock hydrogen peroxide or other chemical is required 
on site; (5) its is easily operated; and (6) all residual ozone can easily be 
decomposed to oxygen and water. 
The decomposition rate of ozone is affected by pH, temperature and 
ozone concentration. During the ozonation process, dyes lose their 
color 
by 
the oxidative cleavage of the chromophores. The cleavage of carbon-carbon 
double bonds and other functional groups, which have high electron densities 
will shift the absorption spectra of the molecule out of the visible region. 
Hydrogen peroxide has been incorporated into the ozonation treatment 
process to enhance its effectiveness. Addition of peroxide lowered the 
reaction time and increased the efficiency of the decolorization especially 
with disperse dyes 
[14].

know concentration of the dye was prepared in deionized water and used for 
all studies. The molecular structure of reactive dyes are elicited in Figure 1, 
whereas 
color 
index and studied h of the reactive dyes are illustrated in Table

The simulated dye solutions prepared to investigate the effects of dye 
bath constituents on treatment efficiency were made typical amounts of dye 
at concentrations normally encountered in real case exhausted dye bath 
effluents. 
All experiments with ozone were carried out in a 1000 mL contact tower. 
The ozone was generated from the ozone generator marca Iberozono, model 
80, and driven by an air pump with adjustable flow rates. A mechanical 
stirrer worked with the gas diffuser to achieve sufficient recirculation of the 
dye solution, so a favorable gas transfer rate was expected 
[15]. 
Dye concentrations 40 
mg/L 
and saturated ozone concentrations in 
excess (by adjusting air-flow rate) were applied to investigate the reaction 
kinetics of dye ozonation. Samples were collected from the contact tower at 
times of 0, 5, 15, 60 min, the residual dyes were analyzed by 
spectrophotometric for quantification. Four initial

was the same as that for 03; the only difference being that in each 
experiment, a certain amount of hydrogen peroxide was added (30%

2.2 Color measurement 
The 
color 
of the initial and treated samples was determined by absorbance 
measurements using a 
Shimadzu UV- 1601 model double-bean 
spectrophotometer. The light absorbance at the characteristic wavelength of 
the samples, eg., 
A490 
(Direct Black 
168), 
Asso 
(Acid Black 
241), 
A443 
(Acid 
Brown 191) and 
A381 
(Acid Brown 83), were measurement to follow the 
progress of decolourization during ozonation. The percent 
color 
removal was 
determinated by using the integrated absorbance of the initial sample, t=O, 
and the integrated absorbance of the sample after being treated for i minutes, 
t=i. Equation 1 shows the formula for percent color removal. 
%Color Removal = absorbancer=i )A 00

2.3 Kinetic evaluation 
During the application of avanced oxidation processess, decolorization of the 
reacting samples exhibited decay. Assuming first order reaction kinetics for 
the synthetic 
dyehouse 
effluent matrix, the decolorization rate constant was 
determinated 
from slope of the 
semilogaritmic 
plot of 
color 
versusadvanced 
treatment time, respectively, in accordance with the kinetic equation; 
where Kd stands for the first order decolorization rate constant (in llrnin). 
3 Results and discussion 
3.1 O3 Treatment 
As can be observed in Figures 2 to 5, by treating the four dyes with ozone, 
practically 100% colour elimination is obtained with contact at long intervals 
of time. 
It can be tested that at short intervals of reaction time (5-15 minutes), a 
greater elimination of colour at basic 
pHs (8 and 10) is obtained than at acid 
pHs (2 and 4); nevertheless, in the case of the dye Brown Denna D2R (Acid 
brown 191) only, it was observed that, both at short and long intervals of 
time, the best reduction of colour is obtained at pHs. Whereas with the dyes 
Carbon Derma (Direct black 
168), 
Blue1 
Coracido 2B-175 (Acid Black 241) 
and Brown Coracido CG (Acid Brown 83) the best results are obtained at 
long intervals with acid pHs. 
As can be seen from the results, high elimination of colour is obtained 
using ozone; this is due to the oxydation or break down of the complex 
compounds and chromophores that form the dyes 
[16].

The pH of the solution alters the chemical composition of the ozone so, 
the hidroxile free radicals are formed by the decomposition of the ozone at 
high pH whereas the molecular ozone 
remains 
as the main dye at low 
pHs 
[17], this explains the different behaviour of the ozone at different conditions

Figure 5: Color removal Brown Derma D2R with o3 treatment 
3.2 O3 /H20L Treatment 
In accordance with the results obtained and shown in Figures 6 - 9, a general 
tendency towards a greater colour reduction can be observed at short periods 
of time (4, 5 minutes), with hgh concentrations of hydrogen peroxide; 
reaching reductions of between 36-52% for the dyes Carbon Derma NBS, 
Blue Coracido 2B-175 and Brown Cocacido CG and 19% for the dye Brown 
Denna D2R (which is much more difficult to break down). 
This tendency is reversed after 5 minutes reaction time; a greater 
reduction of the colour is obtained with low concentrations of H202, with 
colour reductions close to 90% after 1 hour of treatment for the dyes Carbon 
Denna NBS DB-168 (Direct Black 16), Blue Coracido 2B-175 (Acid Black 
241), 
and Brown Coracido CG (Acid Brown 831, whereas for the dye Brown 
Derma D2R (Acid brown 
19 1, AB-1 91) a reduction of only 40% is obtained.

Treatment with ozone permits reductions close to 100% to be obtained, 
both fox the dyes in the chromophore group and the azo group. Treatment 
with ozone and hydrogen peroxide does not improve the results obtained 
from treating water only with ozone at long intervals, nevertheless it does 
allow greater reductions of colour at short intervals of time (5-1 5 minutes).
