Abstract: The use of cheap and ecofriendly adsorbents has bee n studied as an alternative substitution of 
activated carbon for the removal dyes from wastewat er. Adsorbents prepared from sugarcane baggase-an 
agro industries waste was successfully used to remo ve the methyl red from an aqueous solution in a bat ch 
reactor. This study investigates the potential use of sugarcane baggase, pretreated with formaldehyde 
(PCSB) and sulphuric acid (PCSBC), for the removal of methyl red from simulated wastewater. 
Formaldehyde treated and sulphuric acid treated sug arcane bagasse were used to adsorb methyl red at 
varying dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, pH and  contact time. Similar experiment was conducted 
with commercially available powdered activated carb on (PAC), in order to evaluate the performance of 
PCSB and PCSBC. The adsorption efficiency of differ ent adsorbents was in the order 
PAC>PCSBC>PCSB. The initial pH of 6-10 flavors the adsorption of both PCSB and PCSBC. 
Adsorbents are very efficient in decolorized dilute d solution. It is proposed that PCSB and PCSBC, in a 
batch or stirred tank reactors could be employed as  a low cost alternative in wastewater treatment for  the 
dye removal. 
 
Key words: Formaldehyde, sulphuric acid, dyes, adsorption 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 Dyes production industries and many other 
industries which used dyes and pigments generated 
wastewater, characteristically high in color and 
organic content. Presently, it was estimated about 
10,000 of different commercial dyes and pigments 
exists and over 7 x 10 5 tones are produced annually 
world wide [1]. 
 Dyes are widely used in industries such as textile , 
rubber, paper, plastic, cosmetic etc. Among these 
various industries, textile ranks first in usage of  dyes for 
coloration of fiber. 
 The convectional wastewater treatment, which rely 
on aerobic biodegradation have low removal efficien cy 
for reactive and other anionic soluble dyes. Due to  low 
biodegradation of dye, a convectional biological 
treatment process is not very effective in treating  a dye 
wastewater. It is usually treated with either by ph ysical 
or chemical processes. However, these processes are  
very expensive and cannot effectively be used to tr eat 
the wide range of dyes waste [2]. 
 The adsorption process is one of the effective 
methods for removing dyes from the waste effluent. 
The process of adsorption has an edge over the othe r 
methods due to its sludge free clean operation and 
completely   removed   dyes,   even    from   the  diluted solution. Activated carbon (powdered or granular) i s the 
most widely used adsorbents because it has excellen t 
adsorption efficiency of the organic compound. But,  
commercially available activated carbon is very 
expensive. Furthermore, regeneration using solution  
produced small additional effluent while regenerati on 
by refractory technique results in a 10-15% loss of  
adsorbents and its uptake capacity  [3] . 
 This had led to further studies for cheaper 
substitutions.   Nowadays,   there   are  numerous 
number  of  low cost, commercially available 
adsorbents   which   had   been   used for the dye 
removal (Table 1). 
 However, as the adsorption capacities of the above  
adsorbents are not very large, the new adsorbents w hich 
more economical, easily available and highly effect ive 
are still needed. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Preparation of adsorbents: Powdered activated 
carbon was supplied by BDH Laboratory Supplies, 
Poles England. The adsorbents were used directly 
without any further grinding and sieving. Following  
specification are given by the manufacturer: pH val ue

Formaldehyde treated bagasse: The bagasse obtained 
from the countryside was dried under the sunlight u ntil 
all of the bagasse evaporated and was ground to a f ine 
powder. The ground bagasse was sieved, so that the 
size of fiber used was between -80 to +230 mesh siz e. 
 In order to polymerize and immobilize the color 
and water soluble substances, the ground bagasse th en 
was treated with 1% formaldehyde in the weight to 
volume ratio of 1:5 at 50°C for 4 h. Then, this bag asse 
was filtered out by using a Buchner funnel. It was 
washed with distilled water in order to remove free  
formaldehyde and it was activated at 80°C in the ai r oven for 24 h. The material was kept in an air tigh t 
container for further use. 
 
Sulphuric acid treated bagasse: One part of the 
bagasse was mixed with one part of sulphuric acid a nd 
then heated in a muffle furnace for 24 h at 150 °C.  The 
heated bagasse was washed with distilled water and 
soaked in 1% sodium bicarbonate solution overnight to 
remove residue acid. 
 The material was dried in an oven at 150 °C for 24  
h. Then, the material was ground and sieved, until the 
size between -80 to +230 mesh size was obtained, 
which will be used for this study.  
 
Dye solution preparation: For this study, methyl red 
was used and it was obtained from the local supplie r. 
Following Table 2 shows characteristics of the meth yl 
red. 
 An accurate weighed quantity of the dye was 
dissolved in double distilled water to the prepared  stock 
solution (500 mg L ¯1). Experimental solution of the 
desired concentration was obtained by successive 
dilutions. 
 Dye concentration was determined by using 
absorbance values measured before and after the 
treatment, at 617 nm with Shimadzu UV Visible 
Spectrometer (Model No.: UVmini 1240). 
 An experiment was carried out at initial pH values  
ranging from 2 to 9, initial pH was controlled by t he 
addition of sodium hydroxide, NaOH or hydrochloric 
acid, HCl.  
 
Adsorption experiment: In each adsorption 
experiment, 100 mL of dye solution of known 
concentration and pH was added to 400 mg of 
adsorbents in 250 mL round bottom flask at room 
temperature (26 + 1 °C) and the mixture was stirred  on 
a rotary orbital shaker at 160 rpm. Am. J. Appl. Sci., 2 (11): 1499-1503, 2005

 The sample was withdrawn from the shaker at the 
pre determined time intervals and absorbents were 
separated from the solution by centrifugation at 45 00 
rpm for 5 min. The absorbance of the supernatant 
solution was estimated to determine the residue of dye 
concentration. 
 The experiment was done by varying the amount of 
absorbents (0.2 to 1.0 mg 100 mL ¯1), concentration of 
dye solution (50-250 mg L ¯1) and pH (2-10) at different 
time intervals. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effect of initial dye concentration: The study had 
shown that for the powdered activated carbon (PAC),  
the percentage of dye removal was very high, nearly  
100% for all initial dye concentration and agitatio n time 
(Table 3). The lowest dyes removal was were measure d 
for initial dye concentration of 250 mg L ¯1 and 15 min 
contact time. The efficiency of dye removal was 
increased as the agitation time increased and lower s 
initial dye concentration. 
 For the treated sugarcane bagasse (undergo 
physical and chemical treatment), it had shown an 
increment in the percentage of dye removal. Also, i t 
was found that an increasing in the dye concentrati on 
had caused the decreasing in the percentage of dye 
removal, even though the amount of dye being adsorbed is increased. This will suit the finding w hich 
had been quotes by the other researchers [1-3] . 
 As a comparison, sugarcane bagasses which 
undergo the chemical treatment (sulphuric acid 
treatment) had shown better result in the dye adsor ption 
compared to sugarcane bagasse treated with physical  
treatment (Table 3). The process was rapid initiall y and 
a large fraction of the total amount of dye was rem oved 
within a few minutes. 
 
The effect of pH: For the powdered activated carbon, it 
was found that the percentage of dye removal was no t 
affected by pH variation. The uptake of the dyes wa s 
nearly 100% for all pH values. 
 For the sulphuric acid treated bagasse (PCSB), the  
dyes adsorption was significantly change over the p H 
value of  4 to 7. The lowest percentage of dye remo val 
was recorded at pH 2 (52.2%). At the pH range 7 to 10, 
the percentage of removal was almost remains consta nt. 
As the pH of the solution decrease (more acidic), t he 
number of negatively charged adsorbents site increa sed. 
This will not flavor the adsorption of the positive ly 
charge dyes cation [8]. This, however didn’t apply to the 
PAC, as it was remained almost 100% for all pH 
values. There might be another mode of adsorption, 
such as ion exchange [1]. As the pH value increased from 
9 to 13, the efficiency of the dye removal is sligh tly 
become lessened. Am. J. Appl. Sci., 2 (11): 1499-1503, 2005

Fig. 2: Effect of pH on methyl red removal by PAC, 
PCSB and PCSBC (initial dye concentration 250 
mg L¯1, adsorbent dosage=0.4 g 100 mL ¯1, 
temperature 26°C, contact time=120 min 
 
 The nearly same pattern was obtained for the 
formaldehyde treated sugarcane bagasse (PCSBC). The  
minimum percentages of removal were recorded at pH 
2 (78.5) and the highest percentage recorded at pH 10 
(98.7%). Figure 2 shows the variation of dye remova l 
for different adsorbents at various pH values. 
 
The effect of adsorbance dosage: For the powdered 
activated carbon (PAC), it was found that the 
percentage of dye removal was increased with the 
increament of adsorbance dosage. For the adsorbent 
dosage of 1.0 g 100 mL ¯1, it was found that after 45 min 
agitation time, the amount of dye being adsorbed wa s 
nearly 100% (Table 4). 
 As for sulphuric acid treated bagasse (PCSBC), the  
percentage of dye removal was increased from 54.9% 
to 96.5%, as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0. 2 to 
1.0 g 100 mL ¯1 after the equilibrium time. Also, the 
increment from 17.5 to 74.5% was obtained for PCSB 
for the same increment of adsorbent dosage. This is  due 
to increased in adsorbent dosage attributed to incr ease 
in surface area and availability of adsorption site .  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 The removal of methyl red from simulated 
wastewater by using PAC, PCSB and PCSBC has been 
investigated for different variables viz contact ti me, 
adsorbent dosage pH and initial dye concentration.  
 From this study, it was found that PCSB and 
PCSBC has a lower adsorption efficiency compared to  
powdered activated carbon (PAC) at the any given 
initial dye concentration. The adsorption efficienc y can 
be arranged in the following order 
GAC>PCSBC>PCSB.  This study had shown that PCSB and PCSBC had a 
lower adsorption efficiency compared to GAC at any 
given pH value. Initial dyes concentration over the  
range of 2 to 6, decreased the efficiency of the dy es 
removal. While, the pH range 7 to 10 is optimum for  
the dye removal for both adsorbents, PCSB and 
PCSBC.  
As sugarcane bagasse is easily available in the 
countryside, it has potential to be used for the sm all 
scale industries which produced dyes as their efflu ent, 
after it was being pretreated with formaldehyde and  
sulphuric acid. 
 The data may be useful for designing and 
fabrication of an economically cheap treatment proc ess 
using a batch or stirred tank flow reactors for the  
removal of methyl red from diluted industrial efflu ent.
