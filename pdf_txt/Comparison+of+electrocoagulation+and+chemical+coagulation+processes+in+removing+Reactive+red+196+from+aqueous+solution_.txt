Antibiotics are chemical compounds with a wide spectrum of  
applications in humans and veterinary medicine.1 They are used for 
treatment of diseases caused by various bacterial infections in addition 
to their wide usage in animal farming and aquaculture activity for 
disease prevention and growth promotion purposes.2 These active 
antibiotic residues are found in the environment as a result of runoff of 
domestic, agricultural and industrial effluents.3 Some of the commonly 
used antibiotics were found to be persistent with long half-lives.4 Thus, 
they potentially pose adverse effects to water quality and aquatic life.5 
Widespread use of antibiotics alters microbial ecosystems and exerts 
selective pressure on susceptible bacteria and lead to the survival of 
resistant strains and development of antimicrobial resistance, making 
existing antibiotics ineffective in curing various newly emerging 
infectious diseases.6 In addition to the long-term effect, antibiotics 
through the food chain and potable water in some individuals may 
cause allergic reactions and disrupt the native microbial system when 
they enter it.7 In addition to the long-term effect, antibiotics could  
cause allergic reactions in some individuals as they reach the human  
body via the food chain and drinking water and disrupt the native 
microbial system.7 Tetracycline (TC) is one of the most commonly 
used antibiotics, ranking second in production and use worldwide. 
Tetracycline has been documented to cause resistance to bacteria, 
resulting in environmental resistance. Degradation and risks to human 
health in the food chain by bioaccumulation.8 Therefore, elimination of 
tetracycline from the water system is urgent. 
It presents a significant risk to aquatic living organisms because 
certain antibiotics and their degradation products are harmful and 
carcinogenic.7,8 Meanwhile, worldwide demand for high-quality drinking 
water is growing.9 Therefore, it’s too important establish more efficient water purification treatment methods and improve the operation of 
current methods.10 Generally, treatment of antibiotics effluents can be 
classified into biological, chemical and physical treatment.11 There are 
several methods available for removal of antibiotics from wastewater like 
adsorption over solid surface, membrane separation, advanced oxidation, 
photodegradation , bioremediation, biosorption, Electrocoagulation 
(EC) and etc.12,13 Both strategies have their own distinct benefits and 
drawbacks. Among these techniques, EC has been found a promising 
technique in removal of arsenic, iron from water, removal of chromium, 
removing of hardness of drinking water and etc.14,15 Due to various 
advantages, including environmental compatibility, flexibility, energy 
efficiency, protection, selectivity, automation and cost-effectiveness, 
EC is an attractive approach for the treatment of different forms of 
waste water.16 This method is characterized by simple equipment, easy 
activity, a decrease or absence of chemical-adding equipment and 
decreasing quantities of sediment-forming precipitate or sludge.17,18 
In particular, the key advantages of this method include reducing the 
output of sludge, minimizing the addition of chemicals and minimizing 
space requirements due to shorter residence period especially when 
EC is compared with coagulation therapy.19,20 The present work was 
carried out to study the  removal of TC antibiotics by EC with aluminum  
electrodes from synthetic wastewater.  Wastewater parameters, such 
as initial concentration of TC,  current density, reaction time and pH, 
were also  investigated to examine their effects on the TC. The energy 
consumptions were also  analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
TC with molecular formula: C32H28Na2N2O8S2 and index number: 61585 
and molecular weight: 678.68 g/mol and purify: 99% and was purchased Moein, et al.: Removal of Tetracycline by Electrocoagulation 24 International Journal of Pharmaceutical Investigation, Vol 11, Issue 1, Jan-Mar, 2021The hydroxyl ions produced at the cathode increase the pH in the 
electrolyte and we have a reaction between Al+3 and OH- ions to form 
aluminum hydroxide in the aqueous solution.27
Al+3+ 3H2O      Al (OH)3 +3H+
Results showed the flocs produced at high TC concentration were no 
sufficient to removal all of the TC molecules of the solution.28 Also  
effect of changes in reaction time is shown in Figure 3. The TC removal 
efficiency directly depends on the concentration of hydroxyl and 
produced metal ions on the electrodes.29 An increase in TC removal 
percentage with increase in reaction time is accordance to Faraday’s law. 
Increases in electrolysis time lead to an increase in Al+3 species in the 
EC reactor and their hydroxide flocs on the basis of Faraday’s law, 
thus improving the EC process yield.30 Previous studies are consistent 
with this study.27 The most important parameter for regulating the 
reaction rate inside the electrochemical reactor is current density in all 
electrochemical processes.30 It is well understood that current density 
determines the coagulant output rate, also adjusts the production 
of bubbles and therefore affects the growth of flocs.29 In addition, the 
density of the bubbles increased and their size decreased with the rise in 
cell current, resulting in more rapid removal of contaminants.28Applied 
current density directly affects process performance and operating cost. 
An rise in the density of the current from 100 to 400 A/m2 yielded an 
increase in the efficiency of TC removal. This could be expected : when 
the current density increases, the amount of Al3+ cations released by from Sigma Aldrich Co. and applied without further purification. The 
chemical structure of used TC is showed in Figure 1. The TC stock 
solution (1000 mg/L) was prepared by carrying a certain amount of TC 
in 1000 mL deionized water. Desired concentrations of TC solutions were 
prepared by diluting proper amount of stock solution with deionized 
water.
A electrochemical reactor are shown in Figure 2. This unit is  constructed 
from an electrochemical reactor, a DC power supply and aluminum 
electrodes. The electrodes were placed in 1000 mL aqueous TC  
solutions in a 1500 mL Plexiglas electrolytic reactor. There were 
4 electrodes connected in a bipolar mode in the  electrochemical 
reactor, each with a dimension of 10×15×0.2 cm with the distance 
between electrodes 2 cm. The electrodes  were being washed by dilute 
HCl between the experiments. At the beginning of a run, a particular 
concentration of TC (mg/L) was  feeded into the reactor and its pH and 
conductivity was being adjusted using NaOH and HCl. During the 
runs, the reactor unit was stirred at 120 rpm by a magnetic stirrer (IKA, 
C-MAG HS, Germany). Then  sample was centrifuged (4000 rpm for 5 
min). The TC concentrations were measured at  λmax=280 nm using a  
spectrophotometer  (DR5000). Removal percentage (%R) was calculated 
using the following Eq:21
         (Co-Ce)
% R 
             Co
Where C0 and C e are the initial and equilibrium TC concentrations in 
solution, respectively (mg/L). 
Electric energy consumption was also calculated  using the commonly 
used equation:22,23
       UIt
E= 
         v
Where E is electric energy (kWh/m3), U the  cell voltage in volt (V), I 
the current in ampere  (A), V is the volume of solution (m3) and t is  the 
duration of EC process (minute).
RESUL TS 
Figure 3 shows the effect of initial TC concentration on the TC removal 
efficiency in the range of 10-100 mg/L. The percentage TC removal 
decreases as the initial concentration of the TC increases. 
An increase in current density from 100 to 400 A/m2 yielded an increase 
in the efficiency of TC removal from 71.95 to 98.76%. This could be 
expected : when the current density increases, the amount of Al3+ 
cations released by the anode and therefore of Al(OH)3 particles also 
increases. As a result of increasing current density the electrical energy 
consumptions and operational  costs also increases directly (Figure 4). 
The electrical energy  consumption at 100 A/m2 was 6.5 KWh/m3. 
This adjustment depends on the material form of the electrode and 
the initial pH. In this research, the pH was studied in the range (3-11), 
with the addition of HCl or NaOH, the solution was modified to the 
appropriate pH for each experiment. The effect of pH on  the percent 
recovery is plotted in Figure 5, from this  Figure it can be seen that the 
removal rate increased  with a decreased in the pH. 
DISCUSSION
The following key reactions in aluminum electrodes are illustrated by 
the proposed mechanism of chemical reactions occurring during the EC 
process.24-26

of increasing current density the electrical energy consumptions and 
operational  costs also increases directly (Figure 4). The electrical energy  
consumption at 100 A/m2 was 6.5 KWh/m3.
The pH has a considerable effect on the  efficiency of the EC process, 
also the pH of the medium change during the process.24 This adjustment 
depends on the type of material of the electrode and the initial pH. In 
this research, the pH was studied in the range (3-11), the solution was

efficiency (d=2.5 cm, time=60 min, C0=10 mg/L, Voltage = 60 V, current

The effect of pH on  the percent recovery is plotted in Figure 5, from this  
figure it can be seen that the removal rate increased  with a decreased in 
the pH. When pH was 6 the  reaction was so fast that it takes only (60 
min) to  reach (98.7%) removal efficiency. when the pH is lower than 6 
Al(OH)3 is insoluble from (Al+3) and when it is higher than 8  Al(OH)3 
is insoluble from [Al(OH)4] and because  Al(OH)3 has major role in 
removing of TC, thus  when pH of solution in the range (5-7) TC removal 
is higher.28,31Finally it can be concluded that the processes of contaminant 
destabilization, particulate suspension and emulsion breaking can 
be summarized as three successive phases in the EC method. (1) The 
compression of the diffuse double layer around the charged species by 
ion interactions formed by sacrificial anode oxidation. (2) Neutralization 
by counter ions generated by electrochemical dissolution of the sacrificial 
anode of the charge of the ionic species present in waste water.
These counter ions suppress the electrostatic inter-particle repulsion to 
the point that the van der Waals attraction predominates, thus inducing 
coagulation. In the method, a null net charge occurs. (3) Flock formation: 
the coagulation caused flocks and create a sludge blanket that traps and 
bridges colloidal particles that remain in the aqueous medium.32
CONCLUSION
The aim of this research was to explore the effects of the Operating 
conditions, for instance pH, initial concentration (C0), residence time 
(t) and current density on the removal of a TC by EC process using 
aluminum electrode in a batch electrochemical reactor. It was found 
that the increase in the current density up to 400 A/m2 had increased 
the TC removal efficiency and it has increased the electrical energy 
consumption. A rate of removal of about 98.7% was observed, when 
the C0=100 mg/L,  current density= 400 A/m2, contact time= 60 min 
and initial pH ranged from 5 to 7. Based on the results, EC process by 
aluminum electrodes is an efficient and suitable method for  reactive TC 
removal from aqueous solution.
