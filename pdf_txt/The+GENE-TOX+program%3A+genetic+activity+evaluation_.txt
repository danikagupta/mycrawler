ACTIVITY PROFILES FOR
GENETIC AND RELATED EFFECTS
Methods
The x-axis of the activity profile (Waters et aL., 1987, 1988) represents the bioassays
in phylogenetic sequence by end-point, and the values on the y-axis represent the
logarithmically transformed lowest effective doses (LED) and highest ineffectlve doses
(HID) tested. The term 'dose', as used in this report, does not take into consideration
length of treatment or exposure and may therefore be considered synonymous with
concentration. ln practice, the concentrations used in aIl the in-vitro ttsts were converted
to ¡ig/ml, and those for in-vivo tests were expressed as mg/kg bw. Because dose units are
plotted on a log scale, differences in the relative molecular masses of compounds do not,
in most cases, greatly influence comparisons of their activity profiles. Conventions for
dose conversions are given below.
Profile-line height (the magnitude of each bar) is a function of the LED or HID,
which is associated with the characteristics of each individual test system - such as
population size, ceIl-cycIe kinetics and metabolic competence. Thus, the detection limit
of each test system is different, and, across a given activity profile, responses wil vary
substantially. No attempt is made to adjust or relate responsesin one test system to those
of another.
Line heights are derived as follows: for negative test results, the highest dose tested
without appreciable toxicity is defined as the HID. If there was evidence of extreme
toxicity, the next highest dose is used. A single dose tested with a negative result is
considered to be equivalent to the HID. Similarly, for positive results, the LED is
recorded. If the original data were analysed statistically by the author, the dose recorded
is that at which the response was significant (p .: 0.05). If the available data were not
analysed statistically, the dose required to produce an effect is estimated as follows:
when a dose-related positive response is observed with two or more doses, the lower of
the doses is taken as the LED; a single dose resulting in a positive response is considered
to be equivalent to the LED.
ln order to accommodate both the wide range of doses encountered and positive and
negative responses on a continuous scale, doses are transformed logarithmically, so that
effective (LED) and ineffective (HID) doses are represented by positive and negative
-467-468 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 66
numbers, respectively. The response, or logarithmic dose unit (LDUij), for a given test
system i and chemical j is represented by the expressions
LDUij = -logio (dose), for HID values; LDU:: 0and (1 )
LDUij= -logio (dose x 10-5), for LED values; LDU ~ O.
These simple relationships define a dose range of 0 to -5 logarithmic units for
ineffective doses (1-100 000 Ilg/mL or mg/kg bw) and 0 to +8 logarithmic units for
effective doses (100000-0.001 Ilg/mL or mg/kg bw). A scale illustrating the LDU values
is shown in Figure 1. Negative responses at doses less than 1 Ilg/mL (mg/kg bw) are set
equal to 1. Effectively, an LED value ~ 100 000 or an HID value:: 1 produces an
LDU = 0; no quantitative information is gained from such extreme values. The dotted
lines at the levels of log dose units 1 and -1 define a 'zone of uncertainty' in which
positive results are reported at such high doses (between 10 000 and 100 000 mg/mL or
mg/kg bw) or negative results are reported at such low doses (1 to 10 mg/ml or mg/kg
bw) as to cali into question the adequacy of the test.

ln practice, an activity profile is computer generated. A data entry programme is used
to store abstracted data from published reports. A sequential file (in ASCII) is created for
each compound, and a record within that file consists of the name and Chemical
Abstracts Service number of the compound, a three-Ietter code for the test system (see
below), the qualitative test result (with and without an exogenous metabolic system),
dose (LED or HID), citation number and additional source information. An abbreviated
citation for each publication is stored in a segment of a record accessing both the testAPPENDIX 2469
data file and the citation file. During processing of the data file, an average of the
logarithmic values of the data subset is calculated, and the length of the profile line
represents this average value. Ail dose values are plotted for each profile line, regardless
of whether results are positive or negative. Results obtained in the absence of an
exogenous metabolic system are indicated by a bar (-), and results obtained in the
presence of an exogenous metabolic system are indicated by an upward-directed arrow
Ci). When all results for a given assay are either positive or negative, the mean of the
LDU values is plotted as a solid line; when conflcting data are reported for the same
assay (i.e. both positive and negative results), the majority data are shown by a solid line
and the minority data by a dashed line (drawn to the extreme conflicting response). ln the
few cases in which the numbers of positive and negative results are equal, the solid line
is drawn in the positive direction and the maximal negative response is indicated with a
dashed line. Profile lines are identified by three-letter code words representing the
commonly used tests. Code words for most of the test systems in current use in genetic
toxicology were defined for the US Environmental Protection Agency's GENE-TOX
Program (Waters, 1979; Waters & Auletta, 1981). For IARC Monographs Supplement 6,
Volume 44 and subsequent volumes, including this publication, codes were redefined in
a manner that should facilitate inclusion of additional tests. Naming conventions aredescribed below. .
Data listings are presented in the text and include end-point and test codes, a short test
code definition, results, either with (M) or without (NM) an exogenous activation system,
the associated LED or HID value and a short citation. Test codes are organized
phylogenetically and by end-point from left to right across each activity profile and from
top to bottom of the corresponding data listing. End-points are defined as follows:
A, aneuploidy; C, chromosomal aberrations; D, DNA damage; F, assays of body fluids;
G, gene mutation; H, host-mediated assays; 1, inhibition of intercellular communication;
M, micronuclei; P, sperm morphology; R, mitotic recombination or gene conversion;
S, sister chromatid exchange; and T, cell transformation.
Dose cOl1versiol1S for activity profiles
Doses are converted to llg/mL for in-vitro tests and to mg/kg bw per day for in-vivo
experiments.
1. ln-vitro test systems
(a) Weight/volume con verts directly to llg/mL.
(b) Molar (M) concentration x molecular weight = mg/mL = 10.1 mg/mL; mM
concentration x molecular weight = llg/mL.
(c) Soluble solids expressed as % concentration are assumed to be in units of mass
per volume (i.e. 1 % = 0.01 g/mL = 10 000 llg/mL; also, 1 ppm = i l.g/mL).
(d) Liquids and gases expressed as % concentration are assumed to be given in units
of volume per volume. Liquids are converted to weight per volume using the
density (D) of the solution (D = g/mL). Gases are converted from volume to
mass using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. For exposure at 20-37 °C at standard470 IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 66
atmospheric pressure, 1 % (v/v) = 0.4 f.g/ml x molecular weight of the gas. Also,
1 ppm (v/v) = 4 x 105 f.g/mL x molecular weight.
(e) ln microbial plate tests, it is usual for the doses to be reported as weight/plate,
whereas concentrations are required to enter data on the activity profile chart.
While remaining. cognisant of the errors involved in the process, it is assumed
that a 2-ml volume of top agar is delivered to each plate and that the test
substance remains in solution within it; concentrations are derived from the
reported weight/plate values by dividing by this arbitrary volume. For spot tests,
a 1 -ml volume is used in the calculation.
if Conversion of particulate concentrations given in ¡ig/cm2 is based on the area
(A) of the dish and the volume of medium per dish; i.e. for a lOO-mm dish:
A = nR2 = TC x (5 cm)2 = 78.5 cm2. If the volume of medium is 10 mL, then
78.5 cm2 = 10 mL and 1 cm2 = 0.13 mL.
2. ln-vitro systems using in-vivo activation
For the body fluid-urine (BF-) test, the concentration used is the dose (in mg/kg bw)
of the compound administered to test animaIs or patients.
3. ln-vivo test systems
(a) Doses are converted to mg/kg bw per day of exposure, assuming 1 OO~ --~~~~ .absorption. Standard values are used for each sex and species of rodent;
including body weight and average intake per day, as reported by Gold et aL.
(1984). For example, in a test using male mice fed 50 ppm of the agent in the
diet, the standard food intake per day is 12% of body weight, and the conversion
is dose = 50 ppm x 12% = 6 mg/kg bw per day.
Standard values used for humans are: weight-males, ~~~; females, 55 kg;
surface area, 1.7 m2; inhalation rate, 20 L/min for light wor ~ 30 L/min for mild
exercise.
(b) When reported, the dose at the target site is used. For example, doses given in
studies of lymphocytes of humans exposed il1 vivo are the measured blood
concentrations in ¡ig/mL.
Codes for test systems
For specifie nonmammalian test systems, the first two letters of the three-symbol code
word define the test organism (e.g. SA- for Salmonella typhimurium, EC- for Escherichia
coli). If the species is not known, the convention used is -S-. The third symbol may be
used to define the tester strain (e.g. SA8 for S. typhimurium TA1538, ECW for E. coli
WP2uvrA). When strain designation is not indicated, the third letter is used to define the
specifie genetic end-point under investigation (e.g. --D for differential toxicity, --F for
forward mutation, --G for gene conversion or genetic crossing-over, --N for aneuploidy,
--R for reverse mutation, --U for unscheduled DNA synthesis). The third letter may also
be used to define the general end-point under investigation when a more complete
definition is not possible or relevant (e.g. --M for mutation, --C for chromosomal
aberration). For mammalian test systems, the first letter of the three-Ietter code wordAPPENDlX 2 471
defines the genetic end-point under investigation: A-- for aneuploidy, B-- for binding,
Cu for chromos omal aberration, D-- for DNA strand breaks, G-- for gene mutation,
1-- for inhibition of intercellular communication, Mu for micronucleus formation, R-- for
DNA repair, S-- for sister chrorratid exchange, Tu for cell transformation and U-- for
unscheduled DNA synthesis.
For animal (i.e. non-human) test systems il1 vitro, when the cell type is not specified,
the code letters -lA are used. For such assays il1 vivo, when the animal species is not
specified, the code letters -VA are used. Commonly used aniITal species are identified by
the third letter (e.g. uC for Chinese hamster, --M for mouse, --'R for rat, --S for Syrian
hamster).
For test systems using human cells il1 vitro, when the cell type is not specified, the
code letters -lH are used. For assays on humans il1 vivo, when the cell type is not
specified, the code letters - VH are used. Otherwise, the second letter specifies the cell
type under investigation (e.g. -BH for bone marrow, -LH for lymphocytes).
Some other specific coding conventions used for mammalian systems are as follows:
BF- for body fluids, HM- for host-mediated, --L for leukocytes or lymphocytes il1 vitro
(-AL, animais; -HL, humans), -L- for leukocytes in vivo (-LA, animaIs; -LH, humans),
-- T for transformed cells.
Note that these are ex amples of major conventions used to define the assay code
words. The alphabetized listing of codes must be examined to confirm a specific code
word. As might be expected from the limitation to three symbols, some codes do not fit
the naming conventions precisely. ln a few cases, test systems are defined by first-letter
code words, for example: MST, mouse spot test; SLP, mouse specific locus mutation,
postspermatogonia; SLO, mouse specific locus mutation, other stages; DLM, dominant
lethal mutation in mice; DLR, dominant lethal mutation in rats; MHT, mouse heritable
translocation.
The genetic activity profiles and listings were prepared in collaboration with
Environmental Health Research and Testing Inc. (EHRT) under contract to the United
States Environmental Protection Agency; EHRT also determin~d the doses used. The
references cited in each genetic activity profile listing can be found in the list of
references in the appropriate monograph.
