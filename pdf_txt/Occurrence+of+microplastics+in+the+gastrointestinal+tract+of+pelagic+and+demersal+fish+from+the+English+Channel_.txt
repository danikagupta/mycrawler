Microplastics are present in marine habitats worldwide and laboratory studies show this material can be
ingested, yet data on abundance in natural populations is limited. This study documents microplastics in
10 species of ﬁsh from the English Channel. 504 Fish were examined and plastics found in the gastroin-
testinal tracts of 36.5%. All ﬁve pelagic species and all ﬁve demersal species had ingested plastic. Of the184 ﬁsh that had ingested plastic the average number of pieces per ﬁsh was 1.90 ± 0.10. A total of 351
pieces of plastic were identiﬁed using FT-IR Spectroscopy; polyamide (35.6%) and the semi-synthetic cel-
lulosic material, rayon (57.8%) were most common. There was no signiﬁcant difference between theabundance of plastic ingested by pelagic and demersal ﬁsh. Hence, microplastic ingestion appears to
be common, in relatively small quantities, across a range of ﬁsh species irrespective of feeding habitat.
Further work is needed to establish the potential consequences.

1. Introduction
Marine debris contaminates the world’s oceans from Polar Re-
gions to the equator ( Gregory and Ryan, 1997; Barnes et al.,
2009; Zarﬂ and Matthies, 2010 ), and is found ﬂoating at the sea
surface ( Ryan and Moloney, 1993; Barnes and Milner, 2005 ), on
the seaﬂoor ( Galgani et al., 2000 ) and on shorelines ( Barnes and
Milner, 2005 ). Plastic materials are the most common making up
60–80% of all marine debris ( Gregory and Ryan, 1997 ). This form
of contamination is of concern because it presents a threat to wild-
life and can have important economic impacts on ﬁsheries ( Ryan
et al., 2009 ). The impacts of large items of marine debris (macro-
plastics) on the marine environment have been widely reported
(see previous reviews by Laist, 1997; Derraik, 2002 ). A range of
marine taxa, including birds, sea turtles and marine mammals,
are known to be affected by entanglement and ingestion, with con-
sequences including impaired movement, decreased feeding abil-
ity, reduced reproductive output, lacerations, ulcerations and
death ( Laist, 1997; Derraik, 2002; Moore, 2008; Gregory, 2009 ).
Microplastics were ﬁrst described by Thompson et al. (2004)
who reported the occurrence and presence of plastics around
50lm in size on shorelines and in the water column. Use of this
term has been extended to include all items of plastic debris that
are smaller than 5 mm in size ( Arthur et al., 2009 ). Microplastics
can enter the marine environment directly as granules used forair blasting, pellets and powders which are used for production
of larger plastic products and abrasive scrubbers in cosmetics
and cleansing products ( Fendall and Sewell, 2009; Thompson
et al., 2009a,b ), and indirectly from the breakdown of larger plastic
items as a result of photo-degradation, oxidation and mechanicalabrasion ( Andrady, 2003, 2005; Browne et al., 2007; Thompson
et al., 2009a ).
Studies over the past decade have shown that microplastics are
widespread in the marine environment, at the sea surface, on
shorelines and on the sea bed and that their abundance has in-
creased since the 1960s. Because of their small size, microplastics
have the potential to be ingested by a wide range of marine organ-
isms. Laboratory studies have shown that invertebrates: crusta-
ceans, barnacles, polychaete worms, mussels and amphipods, will
ingest microplastic fragments ( Thompson et al., 2004; Browne
et al., 2008; Graham and Thompson, 2009 ). Whereas there have
been fewer studies documenting the ingestion of microplastic in
the natural environment (but see: Eriksson and Burton, 2003;
Boerger et al., 2010; Murray and Cowie, 2011 ).
Microplastic ingestion has been documented in a selection of
marine organisms. Recent work showed that 83% of Norway lob-
sters, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758) collected in the Clyde
Sea had ingested plastic including monoﬁlament line and frag-
ments of plastic bags ( Murray and Cowie, 2011 ). Microplastic could
have both physical and chemical effects on the organisms that in-
gest them. If ingested, microplastics may pass through the gut or
may be retained in the digestive tract ( Browne et al., 2008 ). Fibres
may knot or clump and could be hazardous if they block feeding
appendages or hinder the passage of food. Hoss and Settle (1990)

suggested that if plastic particles were accumulating in high num-
bers in the intestines of smaller animals, they may have a similar
effect to larger items of debris and clog digestive systems ( Derraik,
2002; Gregory, 2009; Ryan et al., 2009 ). The accumulation of debris
in the digestive tract may also cause a false sense of satiation lead-
ing to decreased food consumption ( Ryan, 1988 ).
There is also concern that, if ingested, small items of plastic
debris might facilitate the transport of chemical contaminants to
organisms. Two mechanisms have been suggested, the release of
chemical additives such as plasticisers incorporated during manu-
facture and the accumulation and subsequent release of persistent
organic pollutants from sea water ( Mato et al., 2001; Teuten et al.,
2009 ). For example, plasticisers such as bisphenol-A (BPA) which
are used in a range of plastic products can affect the hormonal sys-
tems and reproductive output of molluscs, ﬁsh, crustaceans and in-sects ( Endo et al., 2005; Teuten et al., 2007; Oehlmann et al., 2009 ).
Ingestion of microplastics by individual organisms at lower trophic
levels could also have consequences for organisms at high trophic
levels if any contaminants that are transferred have the potential
for biomagniﬁcation ( Teuten et al., 2009 ).
Despite these concerns, there have been few studies speciﬁcally
examining the occurrence of microplastic in natural populations.
The data that is available is for larger fragments of microplastics
1–5 mm (e.g. Day et al., 1985; van Franeker, 1985; Laist, 1997;
Jackson et al., 2000; Pinnegar, 2009 ) and there is little data on
the occurrence of pieces <1 mm. Early work identifying the inges-
tion of plastic by ﬁsh included Carpenter et al. (1972) who de-
scribed pieces <16 mm in Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia
(Linnaeus, 1766). In addition, Hoss and Settle (1990) reviewed pre-
vious papers ﬁnding pieces <50 mm in the European ﬂounder, Pla-
tichthys ﬂesus (Linnaeus, 1758). More recent studies have been
carried out in the North Paciﬁc Gyre which is known to have sub-
stantial accumulation of debris ( Moore et al., 2008 ).Boerger et al.
(2010) found that microplastics (<2.79 mm) were consumed by
ﬁsh feeding in the water column. In addition, Davison and Asch
(2011) found mesopelagic ﬁsh to have ingested plastic ﬁbres, ﬁla-
ments and ﬁlms (mean length 2.2 mm). A recent study on plastic
ingestion by catﬁsh from estuarine waters in Western South Atlan-
tic found all ontogenic phases of the three species of catﬁsh in-
gested plastic ( Possatto et al., 2011 ). However, few studies have
formally identiﬁed the material found using fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). This is considered essential to con-
form the identity of pieces <1 mm.
The primary aim of this study was to describe the types of
microplastic ingested by ﬁsh collected from the English Channel.
With a secondary aim being to determine whether there were dif-
ferences, in the frequency of microplastics, between in pelagic and
demersal ﬁsh. The following speciﬁc questions were examined: (1)establish whether ﬁsh collected in shallow water habitats in the
English Channel had ingested microplastics; (2) if so to identify
what polymers were present; and (3) to assess whether the quan-
tity of plastic ingested by ﬁsh varied between pelagic and demersal
species.
2. Materials and methods
Fish were collected from coastal waters 10 km southwest of
Plymouth, UK (50 /C17616N, 004 /C17615W) during routine Marine Biolog-
ical Association (MBA) standard haul trawls. The standard haul is
part of the long term ﬁsheries sampling carried out at the MBA
since 1913. Note that since these trawls are designed to catch ﬁsh
the mesh size at the cod end was 70–75 mm ( Genner et al., 2010 );
therefore unlike studies of ﬁsh collected from plankton nets (e.g.
Boerger et al., 2010 ) it is extremely unlikely that any of the plastics
found in the ﬁsh examined here (maximum size 14.3 mm – see re-sults) had accumulated in the net and been ingested by ﬁsh whilst
in the net itself. Plastic used in the construction of the net was
examined so as to ensure that fragments of the net were not a po-
tential source of any of the material found in the ﬁsh. Sampling oc-
curred at station L4 which is most consistently sampled ( Genner
et al., 2010 ). Samples were obtained during June 2010 and July
2011 at an average depth of 55 m. The 10 species of ﬁsh used in
this analysis, were ﬁve pelagic species (whiting Merlangius merlan-
gus(Linnaeus, 1758); blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou (Risso,
1827); Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus,
1758); poor cod Trisopterus minutus (Linnaeus, 1758) and John
Dory Zeus faber (Linnaeus, 1758) and ﬁve demersal species (red
gurnard Aspitrigla cuculus (Linnaeus, 1758); Dragonet Callionymus
lyra (Linnaeus, 1758); redband ﬁsh Cepola macrophthalma (Lin-
naeus, 1758); solenette Buglossisium luteum (Risso 1810) and thick-
back sole Microchirus variegates (Donovan 1808)). These were
selected based on data from previous trawls at the L4 station and
the likelihood that sufﬁcient numbers (>25 individuals per species)
would be obtained for analysis. Nomenclature of species follows
Froese and Pauly (2011) . On each of the trawling dates two trawls
were carried out and ﬁsh were pooled into one sample for that day.
Individuals ranged in size from juvenile to adult. As the number of
individuals of each species were not under our control this gave
rise to the different numbers of individuals per species.
Fish were frozen within 2 h of capture, and subsequently
thawed out at room temperature prior to examination. For each
ﬁsh, basic measurements were recorded including length, from
mouth to central point of caudal ﬁn (mm), body weight (g) and
girth, the maximum distance between dorsal and ventral sides
(mm). Gastrointestinal tracts were removed by dissection from
each ﬁsh, from the top of the oesophagus and cut away at the vent.
To prevent contamination, work surfaces were thoroughly
cleaned with alcohol, and hands and forearms were scrubbed.
Gloves (nitrile) were worn throughout the dissection and manipu-
lation instruments cleaned after every specimen. To minimise the
risk of contamination, ﬁsh were opened with a scalpel and diges-
tive tracts were immediately placed in plastic zip lock bags and
stored for up to 3 h before transferring to clean petri dishes for
inspection with a dissecting microscope. All instruments and
equipment were checked under microscopes for contamination be-
fore use. The digestive tracts were cut open in a similar method to
previous studies ( Boerger et al., 2010; Davison and Asch, 2011 ).
Each digestive tract was observed for 10 min, any ingested items
not resembling natural prey were removed using forceps, trans-
ferred to ﬁlter paper and sealed in a clean petri dish prior to further
analysis. The items were photographed and described according to
maximum length, colour, and shape (fragment, ﬁbre, bead, ﬁlm).
FT-IR was used to conﬁrm the identity of each item removed
from the gastrointestinal tract. This was done using a Bruker IFS
66 Spectrometer with a Bruker Hyperion 1000 microscope. FT-IR
determines the structure of molecules through analysis of their
absorption spectra. To allow for maximum absorbance, specimens
were squashed to minimise thickness using a diamond compres-
sion cell. Following background scans, 32 sample scans were per-
formed. OPUS v5.5 software then produced output spectra that
could be compared to spectra in the OPUS polymer database using
Euclidian Distance (ED). This produces a hit quality of the spectral
distance between the known spectra and that from the debris
being identiﬁed, zero being an absolute match and two being no
match (i.e. the smaller the number, the closer the match to the ref-
erence spectra). Following each sample the microscope slide was
wiped with alcohol before subsequent samples were examined.
Samples which produced unclear spectra were manipulated
using OPUS software to allow for a clearer comparison to reference
spectra. Manipulations included smoothing and baseline correc-
tions. Fragments with a high level of certainty (>70% ED matchA.L. Lusher et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 67 (2013) 94–99 95Download English Version:
