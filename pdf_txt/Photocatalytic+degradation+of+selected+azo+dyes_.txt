ABSTRACT  
Photocatalytic degradation of Azure B has been carried out using calcium oxide semiconductor. Effect of various 
parameters like pH, concentration of dyes, amount of semiconductor and light intensity has been studied on the rate of 
reaction. Various control experiments were carried out, which indicated that semiconductor calcium oxide played a key role 
in photocatalytic degradation of dye. A suitable tentative mechanism has been proposed for photocatalytic degradation of 
dye. 
Key words : Photocatalytic degradation, Azure B, Calcium oxide. 
INTRODUCTION 
The treatment of dye containing waste water by conventional methods, such as flocculation, 
activated carbon adsorption  and reverse osmosis are quite ineffective in decolourization of wastewater since 
dye stuffs are recalcitrant and difficult to remove by these processes due to their low molecular weight and 
high water solubility. Moreover, these methods merely  transfer the pollutant from one phase to another 
phase. Alternative biological treatment is difficult to c ontrol in order to achieve the desired degree of 
removal. Recently, there has been considerable interest  in the utilization of advanced oxidation processes for 
the complete degradation of dyes used in textile industry.

EXPERIMENTAL 
Azure B dye was used as a model system to in vestigate the photocatalytic degradation by CaO. 
Molecular formula of Azure B is C 15H16ClN 3S, and its molar mass is 305.83 g/mol. 1.0 × 10-3 M solution of 
Azure B (0.3058 g Azure B in 100.0 mL water) was prepared in volumetric flask with doubly distilled water and stored as a stock solution.  
 
The optical density of Azure B solution wa s determined with the help of a spectro photometer at             
λmax = 650 nm. The dye solution was placed in equal amounts of four beakers. 
(i) The first beaker containing only dye solution was kept in dark. 
(ii) The second beaker containing only dye solution was kept in sunlight.  
(iii) 0.30 g of semiconductor calcium oxide was added to the third beaker containing dye solution 
and was kept in dark, and  
(iv) 0.30 g of semiconductor calcium oxide was added to  the fourth beaker containing dye solution 
and was exposed to sunlight. 
After 4 hours, the optical density of the solution in each beaker was measured with the help of a 
spectrophotometer. It was observed that the optical densit y of solutions of first three beakers remained 
almost same, while the solution of fourth beaker had a decrease in initial value of optical density. The above 
experiments confirms that the reaction between Azure B and semiconductor powder is neither thermal nor 
photochemical but it is a photocatalytic reaction. The data for a typical run are presented in Table 1 and 
graphically presented in Fig. 1. 
The photocatalytic degradation of Azure B was observed by taking dye solution of 2.5 × 10-5 M and 
0.30 g of CaO. Irradiation was carried out keeping the whole assembly exposed to a 200 W tungsten lamp at 
70.0 mWcm-2. A decrease in optical density of Azure B solution was observed with increasing time of 
exposure. A plot of 2 + log O.D. against time was foun d to be linear. The rate constant was measured with 
the following expression k = 2.303 × slope.  R. Ameta and P. Jhalora: Photoc atalytic Degradation of Azure B in …. 24

Effect of pH 
The effect of pH on photocatalytic degradation was inve stigated in the range 3.0-8.0. The results are 
reported in Table 2.

It is evident from the data that the degradation r ate of Azure B increases with increasing pH of 
solution upto 6.0 and above this value of pH the rate of photocatalytic degradation of Azure B starts 
decreasing. It may be explained on the basis th at at low pH, the anionic dye was attracted by positively 
charged surface of photocatalyst, but further increase in pH above 6.0, a decrease in the rate of photocatalytic degradation of the dye may be due to th e fact that Azure B does not remain in its cationic 
form and will not experience a force of attraction with  negatively charged surface of the semiconductor due 
to adsorption of more OH
– ions on the surface of photocatalyst.

The effect of dye concentration on the rate of reaction was also observed by using different 
concentration of the Azure B solution. The results are given in Table 3.

It was observed that the rate of photocatalytic degrad ation increase in the concentration of the dye 
upto 2.5 × 10-5 M. It may be due to fact that as the dye was increased, more dye molecules were available for 
excitation and consecutive degradation. Hence, an increase in the rate was observed. The rate of 
photocatalytic degradation was found to decrease with further increase in the concentration of dye. This may 
be attributed to the fact that the dye started acting as a filter for the incident light and it does not permit the 
desired light intensity to reach the photocatalyst surface; thus, a decrease in the rate of photocatalytic 
degradation was observed.

Effect of amount of semiconductor 
The effect of amount of semiconductor on the rate of photocatalytic degradation of Azure B was also 
observed. The results are reported in Table 4.

0.40 5.62 
0.50 5.41 0.60 5.41 0.70 5.28 0.80 5.28 
It was observed that the rate of reaction increases wi th increase in the amount of semiconductor upto 
0.30 g and beyond 0.30 g, the rate of reaction becomes almost constant; however, there is a slight decrease. 
This may be due to the fact that as the amount of semiconductor was increased in the initial state, the 
exposed surface area of the semiconductor  also increases but after this limiting value (0.30 g) any increase in 
the amount of semiconductor will not increase the exposed surface area but only the thickness of the 
semiconductor layer. This was also confirmed by using reaction vessels of different dimensions. J. Curr. Chem. Pharm. Sc.: 4(1), 2014  27

Fig. 5: Effect of light intensity  R. Ameta and P. Jhalora: Photoc atalytic Degradation of Azure B in …. 28
The data indicate that the degradation action was accelerated  as the intensity of light was increased, 
because any increase in the light intensity increases the number of photons striking per unit time per unit 
area of the photocatalyst powder. An almost linear be haviour between light intensity and the rate of reaction 
was observed. However, higher intensities were avoided due to thermal effects. 
Tentative mechanism of Azure B photodegradation  
On the basis of our experimental observations, a tentative mechanism for photocatalytic degradation 
of Azure B may be proposed as - 
  Dye Dye*

When the solution of the dye was exposed to light in presence of CaO, the 01Dye  molecules are 
excited to first excited singlet state (*
11Dye ). Then these excited molecules are transferred to the triplet state 
through intersystem crossing (ISC). On the other hand, the semiconductor CaO also absorbs photons and as 
a result electron-hole pair is generated. The OH– will react with hole of the semiconductor to generate •OH 
radicals and these radicals will convert the dye mo lecules into products, which are colourless. The 
participation of •OH radicals as an active oxidizing species was confirmed by carrying out the reaction in 
presence of some hydroxyl radical scavengers like 2-propanol, where the rate of degradation was drastically 
reduced.
