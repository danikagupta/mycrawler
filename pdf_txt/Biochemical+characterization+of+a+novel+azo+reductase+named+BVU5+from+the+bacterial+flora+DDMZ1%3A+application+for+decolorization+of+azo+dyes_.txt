One of the main mechanisms of bacterial decolorization and degradation of azo dyes is the use of biological
enzymes to catalyze the breaking of azo bonds. This paper shows the expression and properties of a novelazo reductase (hybrid-cluster NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase, accession no. A0A1S1BVU5, named
BVU5) from the bacterial ﬂora DDMZ1 for degradation of azo dyes. The molecular weight of BVU5 is
about 40.1 kDa, and it contains the prosthetic group ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN). It has the
decolorization ability of 80.1 /C62.5% within 3 min for a dye concentration of 20 mg L
/C01, and 53.5 /C61.8%
even for a dye concentration of 200 mg L/C01after 30 min. The optimum temperature of enzyme BVU5 is
30/C14C and the optimum pH is 6. It is insensitive to salt concentration up to a salinity level of 10%.
Furthermore, enzyme BVU5 has good tolerance toward some metal ions (2 mM) such as Mn2+,C a2+,
Mg2+and Cu2+and some organic solvents (20%) such as DMSO, methanol, isopentyl, ethylene glycol
andN-hexane. However, the enzyme BVU5 has a low tolerance to high concentrations of denaturants.
In particular, it is sensitive to the denaturants guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) (2 M) and urea (2 M).
Analysis of the dye substrate speci ﬁcity shows that enzyme BVU5 decolorizes most azo dyes, which is
indicating that the enzyme is not strictly substrate speci ﬁc, it is a functional enzyme for breaking the azo
structure. Liquid chromatography/time-of- ﬂight/mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) revealed after the
action of enzyme BVU5 that some intermediate products with relatively large molecular weights wereproduced; this illustrates a symmetric or an asymmetric rapid cleavage of the azo bonds by this enzyme.The potential degradation pathways and the enzyme-catalyzed degradation mechanism are deduced inthe end of this paper. The results give insight into the potential of a rapid bio-pretreatment by enzyme
BVU5 for processing azo dye wastewater.
1. Introduction
Azo dyes are organic compounds that color other substances in
a molecular or dispersed state. They are used in many industries
such as textiles, paper printing, and pharmaceuticals.1–3Azo
dyes are synthetic dyes with a high output and application ratein the textile industry. They account for more than 50% of all
dyes synthesized.4,5The molecular structure of azo dyes is
characterized generally by one or more azo groups ( –N]N–),
which are the chromophore. Due to the chemical structure,large quantities of colored e ﬄuents are generated by the textile
industry, which are a di ﬃcult to degrade and are highly toxic to
the aquatic environment.
6Thus, it is of great importance to
separate and degrade the azo dyes from the e ﬄuents, before the
latter are discharged into the environment.
Biological treatment methods are usually cost-e ﬀective and
environmentally friendly, if compared with physical or chemicalmethods. Microorganisms play a signi cant role in biological
treatment methods. Microorganisms which can degrade azodyes include fungi and bacteria. Among the bacteria, aerobic oranaerobic genera like Pseudomonas ,Enterobacter and Bacillus
are the most numerous. Due to the mechanism of action and
growth in di ﬀerent environments, the decolorization rates of
diﬀerent types of microorganisms are quite di ﬀerent.

organisms degrade azo dyes by reducing the azo bonds, whichleads to the formation of amines. Azo reductase enzymes are theaCollege of Environmental Science and Engineering, State Environmental Protection

key enzymes in the process degradation. Azo reductases cleave
the azo bonds using the reductive poses of NADH or NADPH.9
In recent years, many azo reductases from di ﬀerent bacteria
and fungi have been described. They originate from Entero-
coccus faecalis ,Staphylococcus aureus ,Escherichia coli , and Xen-
ophilusazovorans KF46F, which have an azo reductase activity.10
If the strain Shewanella decolorationis S12 used formic acid,
lactic acid or butyric acid as the electron donor, a considerablereduction of various azo dyes resulted. The reduction and
decolorization rate of azo dyes reached more than 80% in 36 h.
11
The results about the strain Shewanella aquimarina reducing the
azo dye Acid Red 27 show that the reduction decolorization ofAcid Red 27 was as high as 97% in 5 h, also a salinity of 5% NaClwas tolerated.
12In our work a large number of proteins
expressed in the system degrade the dye reactive black 5 (RB5),and were screened through macro proteomics analysis. One azoreductase named BVU5 was expressed exogenously in E. coli
through molecular cloning. Enzyme BVU5 is a heterozygous
cluster NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase from the functionalbacterial ora DDMZ1 (NCBI gene accession number
MK583566) with a high-e ﬃciency azo reductase activity.
Most studies are based on the decolorization during bacte-
rial growth, which usually take several hours or even dozens ofhours to achieve a satisfying decolorization e ﬀect.
13Compared
with the rapid catalysis by enzymes such as BVU5, the e ﬃciency
is very low. Hence, puri ed azo reductase BVU5 was directly
applied to the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes in thisstudy. In addition, the enzyme BVU5 was selected from thedominant bacterial genera of the functional bacterial ora
DDMZ1 through macroproteomics technology and thenexpressed and extracted. In this way the separation and puri -
cation of a single strain was avoided, and at the same time thescreening range of azo reductase enzymes was expanded. But
the mechanism of degradation of azo dyes and the properties of
the enzyme are unclear. There are few reports on the e ﬀect of
enzymes on bis-azo dyes with large molecules, complex struc-tures and high concentrations, such as RB5.
14For this reason,
the enzyme BVU5 was regarded as the main research object andin-depth related research was conducted.
The aim of the present study is to investigate the performance
and mechanism of the novel azoreductase BVU5 on the degrada-
tion of azo dyes such as RB5. Consequently, the novel azoreductase
BVU5 was puri ed. The e ﬀects of temperature, pH and salt
concentration as well as the tolera nce to certain metal ions, organic
solvents and high concentration s of denaturants were explored.
T h ed y ed e g r a d a t i o nr a t ea n dt h ee n z y m ea c t i v i t yo fB V U 5w e r eassessed. In addition, the potent ial degradation pathways and the
degradation mechanism are deduced. This study demonstratesthat BVU5 is an enzyme with excellent properties. It is a promising
candidate to degrade azo dyes e ﬃciently in industrial wastewater
and might give insight into a rapid bio-pretreatment.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Reactive black 5 (RB5, CAS no. 17095-24-8, MW 991.82, lmax¼
597 nm) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). E. coli DH5acells and E. coli BL21(DE3) were purchased from Sangon
Biotech Co., Ltd (China). All chemicals were of analytical grade
and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd (Shanghai). The basic medium contained (L
/C01): 0.2 g NH 4Cl,
0.5 g Na 2SO4, 2.66 g KH 2PO4and 3 g yeast extract. All culture
media were sterilized using a pressure steam sterilizer at 115/C14C
and 0.12 MPa for 30 min.
Our laboratory had successfully expressed the hybrid-cluster
NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase (accession no. A0A1S1BVU5,
named BVU5) in recombinant E. coli . The gene of enzyme BVU5
was ampli ed from the bacterial ora DDMZ1. The bacterial
ora DDMZ1 and the recombinant E. coli were stored in our
laboratory.15Previous study revealed the bacterial ora DDMZ1
could decolorize more than 90% of various azo dyes such asReactive Black 5, Acid Red 112, Orange Yellow I, Congo Red andAcid Orange within 24 h. The predominant bacteria in bacterialora DDMZ1 were Stenotrophomonas ,Pseudomonas ,Lactococcus ,
and Alcaligenes unclassi ed_f_Alcaligenaceae
16Through molec-
ular cloning the target gene of enzyme BVU5 was obtained andampli ed. The protein expression vector MBP-BVU5 had been
designed, and the MBP tag was added to reduce the degradationof enzyme BVU5.
2.2 Expression and puri cation of enzyme BVU5
E. coli BL21 containing a recombinant plasmid was streaked on
LB solid medium (30 mgm L
/C01kanamycin) and cultured at 37/C14C
for 12 h. Multiple single colonies were picked and cultured in5 mL LB liquid medium (30 mgm L
/C01kanamycin) at 37/C14C for 4 –
5 h, until the OD 600tide reached to 0.4 –0.6. Isopropyl- b-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with a nal concentration of
1 mM was added to the culture medium at 37/C14C and 100 /C2gfor
4 h to induce the BVU5 expression. A er that, bacterial cells
were collected by high-speed centrifugation (4000 /C2g)a t4/C14C
for 5 min. Then induced cells were ruptured by a homogenizer
(800 psi). A er centrifugation (6000 /C2g)a t4/C14C for 20 min the
supernatant of the cell lysis solution was loaded onto a Ni-NTAcolumn (5 mL, Gen Script, China). Unbound proteins werewashed out with tris bu ﬀer (pH 8) containing imidazole (10, 20
and 30 mM). The bound BVU5 protein was eluted with imid-azole (250, 500 mM) in tris bu ﬀer (pH 8). The puri ed enzyme
BVU5 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A er dialysis, an ultra ltra-
tion tube (30 K) was used to concentrate the protein.
2.3 Prosthetic group and coenzyme preference of enzyme
BVU5
The prosthetic group FMN in BVU5 was identi ed using LC-
TOF-MS. With BC Grade powder of FMN to prepare FMN stan-dard solution. Enzyme BVU5 needs NADH, NADPH or NADP
+as
a coenzyme to degrade azo dyes. Di ﬀerent coenzymes were
added to each system with dye RB5 (20 mg L/C01) and enzyme
BVU5 (0.3 mg) to reveal its performance for decolorization. The
decolorization rates were determined at 25/C14Caer incubation
for 3 min or 3 h.

A concentration series of dye RB5 (20, 40, 80, 100 and
200 mg L/C01) was used to study the decolorization by enzyme
BVU5. The systems contained 0.3 mg BVU5 and 2.5 mM NADH
were incubated at 30/C14C for 30 min. Aliquots from each culture
were collected to examine RB5 decolorization. Three replicateswere processed for each experiment.
The RB5 decolorizing e ﬀect was determined by a spectro-
photometer (Hitachi U200, Tokyo, Japan) at l
maxof 597 nm. The
decolorization ratio was calculated according to the equation:decolorization (%) ¼(A
0/C0At)/A0/C2100, where A0and Atrepre-
sent the initial absorbance of the dye and the absorbance a er
incubation.
2.5 E ﬀects of temperature, pH and salt concentrations
To determine the optimum temperature for enzyme BVU5 for
decoloring of RB5, the reaction solution was incubated ina water bath at temperatures ranging from 10
/C14Ct o6 0/C14C. Each
system contained 0.3 mg BVU5, 2.5 mM NADH and 100 mg L/C01
RB5. The decolorization was measured a er 30 min. In order to
determine the thermal stability of enzyme BVU5, it was incu-
bated at di ﬀerent temperatures (ranging from 10/C14Ct o6 0/C14C) for
1 h. Then the residual activity for decoloring RB5 wasdetermined.
The optimal reaction pH was contested over a pH ranged
from 4.0 to 10.0 with di ﬀerent bu ﬀers (PBS bu ﬀer (pH 4.0 –7.0)
and Tris –HCl bu ﬀer solution (pH 7.0 –10.0)). Each assay con-
tained 0.3 mg BVU5, 2.5 mM NADH and 100 mg L
/C01RB5. The
decolorization was measured a er 30 min. In order to deter-
mine the acid –base stability of the enzyme BVU5, it was pre-
incubated at di ﬀerent pH (ranging from 4.0 to 10.0) at 30/C14C
for 1 h. Then the residual activity for decoloring RB5 wasdetermined.
The eﬀect of di ﬀerent NaCl concentrations (5, 10, 15 and
20%, w/v) on the decolorization of RB5 was explored. Eachsystem contained 0.3 mg BVU5, 2.5 mM NADH and 100 mg L
/C01
RB5. The decolorization was measured a er 30 min. In order to
evaluate the salt stability of the enzyme BVU5, it was pre-incubated at di ﬀerent salinities (ranging from 5% to 20%, w/v)
at 30
/C14C for 1 h. Then the residual activity for decoloring RB5
was determined. Three replicates were processed for eachexperiment.
2.6 E ﬀect of metal ions, organic solvents and denaturants
To estimate the e ﬀect of metal ions on the decolorization by
enzyme BVU5, the reaction solution was mixed with di ﬀerent
metal ions (FeCl
3, MnCl 2, MgCl 2, CaCl 2, CoCl 2, CuSO 4, NiCl 2,
ZnCl 2, FeCl 2and CdCl 2). Each system contained 2 mM of
diﬀerent metal ions, 0.3 mg BVU5, 2.5 mM NADH and
100 mg L/C01RB5. The decolorization was measured a er 30 min.
In order to detect the e ﬀect of metal ions on enzyme stability,
the enzyme BVU5 was pre-incubated with di ﬀerent metal ions
(2 mM, 10 mM) at 30/C14C for 1 h. Then the residual activity on
decoloring of RB5 was determined.Organic solvents were added to study their e ﬀect on the
decolorization of enzyme BVU5. The solvents of DMSO, acetone,
ethanol, methanol, isopentyl, ethylene glycol, N-hexane and
isopropanol were used. Each system contained 0.3 mg BVU5,
2.5 mM NADH and 100 mg L/C01RB5. The content of organic
solvent was 10% (v/v). The decolorization was measured a er
30 min. In order to clarify the e ﬀect of organic solvents on
enzyme stability, the enzyme BVU5 was pre-incubated withorganic solvents at 30
/C14C for 1 h. The nal organic solvent
concentrations were 10% or 20%. Then the residual activity for
decoloring RB5 was determined.
To study the e ﬀect of denaturants on the decolorization
eﬃciency of enzyme BVU5, three denaturants (0.1% SDS, 1 M
urea, and 1 M GdmCl) were selected. Each system contained 0.3mg BVU5, 2.5 mM NADH and 100 mg L
/C01RB5. The decoloriza-
tion was measured a er 30 min. In order to test the e ﬀect of
denaturants on enzyme stability. Enzyme BVU5 was pre-
incubated with di ﬀerent denaturants 0.1% and 0.2% SDS, 1 M
and 2 M urea, and 1 M and 2 M GdmCl at 30/C14C for 1 h. Then the
residual activity for decoloring of RB5 was determined. Threereplicates were processed for each experiment.
2.7 E ﬀect of di ﬀerent dye species
Dye substrate speci city of enzyme BVU5 was measured at the
wavelength established for each dye (597 nm for dye (1) ReactiveBlack 5, 605 nm for dye (2) Trypan Blue, 328 nm for dye (3)Chlorazol Black E, 487 nm for dye (4) Acid Orange 7, 597 nm fordye (5) Acid Black 1, 529 nm for dye (6) Acid Red 112, 486 nm fordye (7) a-Naphthol Orange, 619 nm for dye (8) Acid Blue 40,
596 nm for dye (9) Reactive Blue 4, 596 nm for dye (10) ReactiveBlue 19, 616 nm for dye (11) Malachite Green, 625 nm for dye
(12) Brilliant Green, 543 nm for dye (13) Fuchsin Basic, 597 nm
for dye (14) Crystal Violet. Each assay contained 0.3 mg BVU5,
2.5 mM NADH, and a dye concentration of 100 mg L
/C01.Aer
incubation at 30/C14C for 30 min, the decolorization was
measured. Three replicates were processed for each experiment.
2.8 Kinetic properties of BVU5
The Michaelis constant gives important characteristics of
enzyme. The Michaelis equation re ects the relationship
between the reaction rate and the concentration of thesubstrate,
17,18as shown below:
V0¼Vmax[S]/(Km+ [S])
The Kmvalue is the Michaelis constant, Vmaxrepresents the
reaction, if the enzyme is saturated with the substrate, and [S] isthe substrate concentration, which is calculated from theLineweawer –Burk double reciprocal drawing method.
19The
enzyme BVU5 is a redox enzyme which requires coenzymeNADH or NADPH for the reaction. It is a double substrate
reaction mechanism, also known as sequential reaction or
ping –pong reaction. The mechanism is as follows: ①K
c:E+C
!EC,②Ks:E C+S!ECS,③K: ECS!E + C + P. In this study,
several concentrations of coenzyme NADH and di ﬀerent
1970 |RSC Adv. , 2022, 12,1 9 6 8 –1981 © 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances Paperconcentrations of dye RB5 were used as substrates. The recip-
rocal substrate concentration 1/[S] and the initial enzyme
reaction rate 1/ vwere plotted reciprocally.20According to the
dynamic equation of the sequence mechanism, the followingresults:
V¼(V
max/C2[C][S])/([C][S] + [S] Kc,m+ [C]Ks,m+Kc,mKs,m)
where [C] means the concentration of coenzyme NADH and [S]
is the concentration of substrate RB5. In a multi-substratereaction, the Michaelis constant of one substrate changeswith the concentration of the other substrate, where K
c,mrefers
to the Michaelis constant of NADH if the concentration of dyeRB5 reaches saturation. K
s,mrefers to the Michaelis constant of
the RB5 substrate if the concentration of coenzyme NADH
reaches saturation. Vmaxis the maximum reaction rate if both,
the coenzyme and the substrate reach saturation.
To calculate the kinetic parameters such as Kmand Vmaxof
enzyme BVU5, 20 –200 mg L/C01of dye RB5 and 0.5 –5m Mo f
coenzyme NADH were tested. 0.3 mg enzyme BVU5 was added
and reacted at 30/C14C for 30 min. The reduction of dye RB5 per
unit time was used as the reaction rate of enzyme BVU5. Thecharacteristic absorption peak of RB5 at 597 nm measured by
spectrophotometery was used to determine the activity of
enzyme BVU5. According to the Lineweawer –Burk double
reciprocal plot, the kinetic parameters K
mand Vmax were
calculated.
2.9 Measurement of RB5 degradation metabolites
The enzyme BVU5 (0.3 mg) was incubated with NADH 2.5 mM
under optimal conditions and used to decolorize 100 mg L/C01
RB5. Assays were performed in triplicate. The decolored samples
were taken at regular intervals and centrifuged at 4000 /C2gfor
10 min. The supernatants were scanned over the UV-visible fullspectrum from 200 nm to 800 nm. RB5 degradation metaboliteswere identi ed by FTIR and LC-TOF-MS according to previous
study.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Expression and puri cation of enzyme BVU5
The protein expression vector MBP-BVU5 had been designed
using Snap Gene. The MBP tag was added to reduce thedegradation of enzyme BVU5 and enhance the puri cation
eﬃciency (Fig. S1(A) †). The molecular weight of the MBP tag was
about 40.4 kDa, and the molecular weight of enzyme BVU5 wasabout 40.1 kDa. So it was estimated that the molecular weight ofMBP-BVU5 fusion protein was about 80.5 kDa (seen inFig. S1(B) †). The gene was cloned into a pET28a (+) vector with
a6/C2His tag, and nally transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for
protein expression. The BVU5 protein had been expressedsuccessfully as a soluble part a er the induction of IPTG. A er
elution with 250 mM imidazole, the puri ed protein BVU5 was
separated as a single band (seen in Fig. S1(B) †).3.2 Cofactor identi cation and coenzyme preference
Since the enzyme BVU5 had light a yellow color a er puri ca-
tion (shown in Fig. 1(A)), it was speculated that the protein waycontains the prosthetic group FMN. The results by LC-TOF-MSanalysis show that the molecular weight of FMN in the posi-tive ion mode is 457.1119 (without sodium ions) or 479.0938(with sodium ions) (Fig. 1(B)). Compared with the mass spec-
trum of the FMN standard solution (Fig. 1(C)), the spectrum of
the enzyme BVU5 had the same mass peaks as those of the FMNstandard solution. This con rms that the FMN is part of enzyme
BVU5. This also was veri ed by previous experiment that only
the coenzymes NADPH or NADH need for the catalytic reactionof enzyme BVU5 without FMN.
Enzyme BVU5 is a heterozygous cluster NAD(P)-dependent
oxidoreductase. Its catalytic reaction requires coenzymes.
Since coenzymes o en are soluble components of the enzyme.
The preference of enzyme BVU5 for coenzymes. Three coen-zymes, NADP
+, NADH and NADPH, were added as electron
donors to catalyze the reaction and degrade the dye RB5. Theeﬀect is shown in Table 1.
The samples with the coenzymes NADPH or NADH decol-
orized RB5 within 3 min (the samples no. 5 and no. 7). But theaddition of NADP
+had no e ﬀect (sample no. 6). The sample
without BVU5 but with coenzyme NADP+(sample no. 3) and the
sample without coenzyme but only with enzyme BVU5 (sampleno. 8), also did not decolorized RB5. Interestingly, a er an
incubation for 3 h, the samples containing coenzymes NADPHor NADH (the samples no. 2 and no. 4 in Table 1) had anobvious decolorization e ﬀect. Therefore, it can be deduced that
enzyme BVU5 catalyze the decolorization of dye RB5 only withcoenzymes NADPH or NADH. Also, the reducing coenzymes
NADPH or NADH alone had a certain decolorizing e ﬀect on
RB5, but together with the enzyme BVU5, the decoloration ratewas improved signi cantly.
22
3.3 E ﬀect of di ﬀerent RB5 concentrations
The reaction speed of enzyme-catalyzed dye decolorization is
very high. The photos in Table 2 show the color change intui-tively, which indicates the decolorization performance of dyeRB5 at di ﬀerent concentrations. Samples 4 and 5, which are the
assays with enzyme BVU5 and coenzyme NADH or NADPH, hadthe best decolorization e ﬀect for any concentration of RB5
(Table 2). Within 3 min, the original blue or black color(depending on the concentration of RB5) changed to light
purple or purple and stabilized within 30 min. The decoloriza-
tion could reach up to 80.1 /C62.5% (BVU5 + NADH system 4) or
75/C62.4% (BVU5 + NADPH system 5) if the dye concentration
was 20 mg L
/C01with a reaction time of 3 min (Fig. 2). If the dye
concentration increased, the decolorization rate decreased, itstill reached 53.5 /C61.8% (BVU5 + NADH system 4) or 49 /C62.1%
(BVU5 + NADPH system 5) even at a dye concentration of200 mg L
/C01aer 30 min reaction. At the same time, there was
a little di ﬀerence between di ﬀerent coenzymes in the decolor-
ization of RB5. NADH acted was better than NADPH. Therefore,only NADH was used as the main coenzyme for the followingexperiments. The catalytic reduction of various dyes by the

donor had usually been studied.23,24
3.4 E ﬀects of temperature, pH and salt concentration
The eﬀect of temperature on the decolorization and enzymatic
activity of BVU5 were investigated from 10/C14Cu pt o6 0/C14C.25As
shown in Fig. 3(A), the enzyme at a temperature of 30/C14C had the
highest decolorization rate of 63.6 /C62.6%. The thermal stability
of enzyme BVU5 is shown in Fig. 3(B). BVU5 displayed themaximum activity at 30
/C14Caer incubation for 1 h. From 10/C14C
up to 30/C14C the relative activity of BVU5 increases linearly.
However, for a temperature above 35/C14C the relative activity of
BVU5 decreases rapidly. These results indicate the optimum
temperature for enzyme BVU5 is 30/C14C.
The pH was an impact on the structure and function of
enzyme BVU5. It also can a ﬀect the degradation of the dyeRB5.26In this experiment the e ﬀect of pH on decolorization and
enzymatic activity of BVU5 were investigated over a pH from 4up to 10. Fig. 3(C) shows that the decolorization has the highestvalue at pH 6. The decolorization had the highest value at thispH of 70.9 /C62.1% within 30 min. Therefore, the optimal pH of
enzyme BVU5 is 6. As the data in Fig. 3(D) shows that at pH 6,
enzyme BVU5 has the highest relative activity. Yang
27reported
that an azo reductase had the highest stability at pH 6.5 insodium phosphate bu ﬀer and the activity decreased signi -
cantly in other bu ﬀers with an incubation time of only 1 h. Lu
28
constructed a fusion enzyme GFA which was sensitive against
pH changes. A er an incubation of only 1 h the degradation
activity of GFA decreased in di ﬀerent bu ﬀers. The residual
activities of that GFA were around 50% or 20% in bu ﬀers with
pH 5.0 or pH 8.0, respectively. In our study a er incubation for
1 h BVU5 retained over 60% of the initial activity with pHranging from 5.5 to 8.0.
Salts are o en used as a solid tissue in printing processes.
The conventional treatment guidance cannot remove all saltsions, this results in high concentrations of salts in wastewatersuch as NaCl and Na
2SO4.29Salts have been a signi cant factor
in the decolorization of dyeing wastewater, which will a ﬀect
microorganism growth. The content of salts will a ﬀect the
activity of enzyme. Thus, the salt resistance of enzyme BVU5 wasstudied since it is vital for the decolorization of azo dye waste-water. Fig. 3(E) shows that the enzyme BVU5 is capable ofdecolorizing RB5 dye in a wide range of salt concentrations (0 –
20% NaCl, w/v). Although the highest decolorizing e ﬀect was
observed at 0% salt concentration with RB5 and a decoloriza-
tion eﬃciency of 61.7 /C62% within 30 min, the enzyme BVU5
displayed a notable tolerance to high salinity and even decol-orize 48.9 /C61.8% RB5 with 5% NaCl (w/v), decolorize 48.3 /C6
2.2% RB5 with 10% NaCl (w/v), and decolorize 34.7 /C61.6% RB5
with 15% NaCl (w/v) within 30 min. The e ﬀect of salinity on
enzyme activity is shown in Fig. 3(F). A er an incubation for 1 h
the highest enzyme activity was observed at 0% salt concen-tration (NaCl). 95% relative activity were noted at 5% salt
concentration, and 78% at 10% salt concentration. Avinash

less, in this report, the enzyme BVU5 was found insensitive tosalt concentration below 10% and showed a preferable appli-cability for a rapid treatment of high-salt dyeing wastewater.3.5 E ﬀects of metal ions, organic solvents and denaturants
Wastewater usually contains a variety of metal ions, which
might a ﬀect the activity of enzymes.
32,33In order to detect the
dependence of BVU5 enzyme on metals ions and their in uence
on the decolorization of RB5, the metal ions Mn2+,M g2+,C a2+,
Fe2+,F e3+,C u2+,N i2+,Z n2+,C o2+, and Cd2+were added to the
assay.34The data for RB5 decolorization are shown in Fig. 4(A).
The presence of Cd2+ion (2 mM) markedly inhibited the RB5
decolorization by enzyme BVU5 (decolorization of 11.7 /C61.5%),
followed by Fe3+,C o2+,Z n2+,N i2+and Fe2+. Comparatively, the
metal ions Mn2+,C a2+and Mg2+had scarcely any inhibiting
eﬀect on RB5 decolorization. In the presence of Cu2+ion (2
mM), the decolorization reached the highest value of 61.9 /C6
4.1%, which was about 4% higher than the one of the controlsamples (decolorization 57.6 /C62.4%). This indicates that a low
concentration of Cu
2+stimulates the activity of enzyme BVU5.
Moreover, the relative activity of enzyme BVU5 a er incubation
for 1 h with di ﬀerent metal ions was investigated. As shown in
Fig. 4(B), Cd2+had the highest inhibitory impact on enzyme
BVU5 activity with a relative activity was 3.1 /C62% (10 mM).
Similarly, Fe3+,C o2+,Z n2+,N i2+and Fe2+had a negative impact
on BVU5. In contrast, other metal ions like Mn2+,C a2+,M g2+
and Cu2+had little inhibition e ﬀect on BVU5. It could be known
that the activity of enzyme BVU5 can be a ﬀected greatly by metal
ions such as Cd2+,F e3+,C o2+,Z n2+,N i2+and Fe2+, but less

ions possibly change the activity of enzyme, because the way to
combined with it and form a stable or unstable protein.35It has
been reported that the addition of Cu2+to the puri ed enzyme
stimulates activity, but only at a low concentration of under1 mM.
36The ions Ca2+,M n2+,M g2+also have been reported to
stimulate activity.37,38
Wastewater contains o en a mixture of organic solvents,
organic matter.39Consequently, it is necessary to determine the
eﬀect of organic solvents on decolorization and enzymatic
activity of BVU5. As shown in Fig. 4(C), the presence of theorganic solvent isopropanol signi cantly inhibited the RB5
decolorization by enzyme (decolorization 12.61 /C63.5%),
acetone and ethanol. The solvent N-hexane scarcely had an
inhibiting e ﬀect on RB5 decolorization (decolorization of 55.7 /C6
4%), similar to ethylene glycol (decolorization of 50.71 /C63.8%).
Additionally, the relative activities of enzyme BVU5 a er incu-
bation for 1 h with di ﬀerent organic solvents were investigated
and are displayed in Fig. 4(D). Isopropanol, acetone and ethanolhad a great inhibitory e ﬀect. Only about 20% of the origin
activity remained. The other organic solvents DMSO, methanol,isopentyl, ethylene glycol and N-hexane had little inhibitory
eﬀect on the relative activity of BVU5. Summarily, enzyme BVU5
had a good tolerance toward some organic solvents, which maybe conducive to the degradation of azo dyes in organic solvents
containing wastewater.
The eﬀect of denaturants on decolorization of RB5 by
enzyme BVU5 is presented in Fig. 4(E). All denaturants causedan inhibitory e ﬀect on decolorization of RB5, if compared to the
control without any denaturant (PBS system, decolorization57.7/C62.3%). The presence of the denaturant GdmCl (2 M), the
decolorization decreased considerately to 14.4 /C63.4% a er
incubation for 30 min, urea caused at 1 M, a decolorization of
20.3/C65.7% and the denaturant SDS at 0.1% produced
a decolorization of 31.0 /C66.4%. Furthermore, the relative
activity of enzyme BVU5 a er incubation for 1 h with di ﬀerent
denaturants were investigated and are displayed in Fig. 4(F). A22.6/C66.4% residual activity of enzyme BVU5 was reported a er
incubation with 2 M GdmCl. Similarly, 31.3 /C64.6% residual
activity was reported a er incubation with 2 M urea and 49.7 /C6
4.3% residual activity was reported for an incubation with 0.1%
SDS. Only 6.2 /C62.1% residual activity was reported for an
incubation with 0.2% SDS. Verma

enzyme from Chromobacterium violaceum , which had 55%
residual activity was reported with 2 M urea for a concentration,50% activity at 2 M GdmCl and 60% residual activity o ﬀer 0.1%
SDS treatment. Obviously, enzyme BVU5 has a low tolerance tohigh concentration of denaturants, especially it is sensitive todenaturants SDS and GdmCl.
3.6 E ﬀect of di ﬀerent dyes
In order to explore the e ﬀect of di ﬀerent dyes with varied
structure and composition on the decolorization by the enzymeBVU5, a total of 14 di ﬀerent dyes were tested. The dyes were azo
dyes, anthraquinone dyes and triphenylmethane dyes.Ae r3 0m i ni n c u b a t i o nr e m a r k a b l ed i ﬀerences in decol-
orization of the di ﬀerent dyes by enzyme BVU5 were noted
(Table 3 and Fig. 5). As showed in Table 3, the di ﬀerences
agreed with their chemical structures and type of substitu-tions.
40Obviously, the removal e ﬃciency for azo dyes and for
triphenylmethane dyes were generally higher than those foranthraquinone dyes. Azo dyes, such as sample 1: ReactiveB l a c k5 ,s a m p l e4 :A c i dO r a n g e7 ,s a m p l e5 :A c i dB l a c k1 ,sample 6: Acid Red 112, and sample 7: a-Naphthol Orange
existed a signi cant color change and e ﬃcient decolorization
(Fig. 6), especially a-Naphthol Orange (77.2 /C62.5%), Reactive
Black 5 (68.2 /C63%) and Acid Red 112 (60.1 /C61.9%). However,
i nt h ea s s a yw i t hs a m p l e2 :T r y p a nB l u ea n ds a m p l e3 :Chlorazol Black E almost no color change was detectedcausing a low decolorization (Fig. 5). It has been reported thatthe structures of those azo dyes are complex, containingmultiple bisphenyl rings and azo bonds. The latter may be
diﬃcult to degrade by the enzyme. The results reveal enzyme
BVU5 can decolorize many azo dyes, but not all.
Interestingly, most of the triphenylmethane dye were
degraded e ﬃciently such as malachite green, brilliant green
and fuchsin basic. In order to determine whether the decolor-ization is caused by enzyme BVU5 or only by coenzyme NADH,those dyes were reacted with coenzyme NADH only. The resultsare shown in Table S1. †Almost all azo and anthraquinone dyes
had no color change, indicating that NADH alone had no e ﬀect.
However, the triphenylmethane dyes showed a similar colorchange within 30 min with NADH alone as in the system withenzyme BVU5. Comparing these results, the conclusion can bedrawn that the decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes may becaused mainly by the coenzyme NADH, and not by the enzymeBVU5.
3.7 Kinetic properties of BVU5
In this experiment, K
mand Vmaxof enzyme BVU5 were deter-
mined with di ﬀerent concentrations of RB5 and NADH. Three
regression equations were calculated as y¼1.9994 X+ 20.684 ( R2
¼0.9908), y¼1.5993 x+ 18.716 ( R2¼0.9951), and y¼0.8742 x+
14.064 ( R2¼0.9932) according to Fig. 6. The kinetic parameters
of the puri ed enzyme BVU5 for the degration of RB5 are shown
in Table 4. The experiments used RB5 as a substrate, and NADHas an electron donor. The BVU5 enzyme conformed to thedouble-substrate ping –pong kinetic mechanism. As the
concentration of RB5 increased, the reduction rate decreased.As can be seen from the result, RB5 could be a competitiveinhibitor of NADH.
Data in Table 4 indicates that if RB5 is used as saturation, the
Michaelis constant for NADH ( K
c,m) is 1.346 mmol L/C01. If NADH
is used as saturation, the Michaelis constant for RB5 ( Ks,m)i s
0.092 mmol L/C01. The maximum reaction rate of enzyme BVU5
(Vmax) is 0.067 mmol L/C01min, if substrate RB5 and NADH are
present at saturation concentration.

1976 |RSC Adv. , 2022, 12, 1968 –1981 © 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of ChemistryRSC Advances PaperVis spectrophotometry. The dye RB5 has a characteristic
absorption peak at 597 nm. This is ascribed to the presence ofchromophoric azo bonds as well as aryl, and naphthalene-like
moieties.
41The spectra of RB5 a er treatment by enzyme
BVU5 from 3 min to 3 h displayed a notable decrease of themain peak (597 nm). On the other hand, a peak at 260 nm
become visible (Fig. S2 †). Fig. S3 †shows that when NADH was
added in the presence of the enzyme, the peak at 430 nmdisappeared. Obviously, the chromophores in the RB5 mole-
cule related with the reduced enzyme BVU5, causing them tobe reduced and degraded for those intermediate aromaticTable 3 Photos of the decolorization e ﬀect of enzyme for di ﬀerent dyes (100 mg L/C01dye, incubation 30 min at 30/C14C)a

3.8.2 FTIR analysis. The atoms of chemical bonds or func-
tional groups are constantly vibra ting in organic molecules. If they
are irradiated with infrared light, the vibration frequency is close tothe vibration frequency of the atoms themselves.
43,44Therefore,
chemical bonds and functional groups can be deduced based onthe infrared spectra. The FTIR spectra showed absorption bandsare 3000 –2800 cm
/C01in the region. The peaks at 2921 cm/C01and
2850 cm/C01are corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric C –H
stretching vibrations of the –CH 2–groups. They may result from
methylene groups of an aromatic ring cleavage or of the dyesmolecular structure degradation to –SO
2–CH 2CH 2–OSO 3Na
(Fig. S4 †). The intensity of the peak at 1635 cm/C01increased
markedly, this indicates that a large amount of amide compoundswere produced for RB5. The peak at 1261 cm
/C01represents the
stretching vibration of C –O, the peaks at 1078 cm/C01and 1063 cm/C01
represents the vibration of CN in C –NH 2, and the peak at 750 cm/C01
represents the deformation vibration of CH in aromatic ring of
hydrocarbons, (Fig. S5 †).45–47These results show that RB5 was
degraded by enzyme BVU5 into aromatic amine compounds andother small substances.
3.8.3 LC-TOF-MS analysis. LC-TOF-MS was employed to
identify the degradation products of RB5 a er enzyme attack.
The degradation products with the most probable structure are
summarized in Table 5 according to their molecular weight.
Four di ﬀerent products have been detected. The resulting
possible reaction pathway for RB5 degradation, as catalyzed byenzyme BVU5 is proposed in Fig. 7.
During the experiment, the color of the liquid turned to
purple, a er 30 min of enzyme action. Finally, the expected
light-yellow color did not resume. Therefore, it seems that theRB5 molecule rstly underwent symmetric and asymmetric azo
bond reductive cleavage as well as desulfonation to form those
main substances, namely 3,5-diamino-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonate (253.25 g mol
/C01) and 2,7,8-triaminonaphthalen-1-ol
(189.22 g mol/C01) (Fig. 7). Subsequently, the rst convertedinto 3,4,5-trihydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonate (255.22 g mol/C01)
by deamination, which had been detected as product in this
experiment.48Then 2,7,8-triaminonaphthalen-1-ol was con-
verted to 2-amino-7,8-diimino-1-naphthol (187.20 g mol/C01), and
subsequently converted into 2,8-diimino-1,7-naphthalenediol(188.19 g mol
/C01) by deamination and hydroxylation in this
experiment. On the other hand, 2-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]ethyl hydrogen sulfate was attacked further, resulting in thebreakage of the S –O bond ( i.e., desulfonation) to generate 2-(4-
aminobenzenesulphonyl) ethanol (201.24 g mol
/C01). Aerwards,
it was degraded to 4-vinylsulfonyl-aniline (183.23 g mol/C01)b y
dehydroxylation and dehydrogenation. The intermediates 2-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl] ethyl hydrogen sulfate, 2-(4-amino-benzenesulphonyl) ethanol and 4-vinylsulfonyl-aniline are o en
found as identi ers for RB5 degradation.
49–51This indicated that
the enzyme BVU5 forms intermediate products with relativelylarge molecular weight by the symmetric or asymmetric
cleavage of the azo bond. In comparison, bacteria can further
degrade these intermediate products like Klebsiella sp. KL-1,
who subsequently destroys the aromatic ring of 4-amino-phenol and generates ( Z)-4-amino-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid
(115.09 g mol
/C01).21Zhang52found that the bacterial ora
DDMZ1 produced many metabolites with low molecule in thepresence of product.
The enzyme-catalyzed degradation of RB5 by enzyme BVU5
with the coenzyme NADH is deduced in Fig. 8. The catalysis of
enzyme BVU5 occurs by electron transfer. The enzyme BVU5transfer the electron from NADH to the azo bond. Through thiscatalysis the azo bonds are cleaved gradually to form the abovediscussed intermediates, 2,8-diimino-1,7-naphthalenediol, 4-vinylsulfonyl-aniline and 3,4,5-trihydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonate. This process happens fast. The color of the dyechanged signi cantly within 3 min, and became stable within
30 min. Thus, the enzyme BVU5 acting on RB5 mainly provides
a rapid pretreatment method. It breaks quickly the key azobonds, and provides the basis for a subsequent biologicaldegradation.
