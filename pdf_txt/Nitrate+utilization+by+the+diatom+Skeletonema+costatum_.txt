ABSTRACT: Excretion of nitrite during nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton is examined in relation to 
estimates of new production. Evidence from the literature indicates that nitrite excretion is exhibited by 
a wide variety of phytoplankton species in cultures and can represent up to 25, 45 and 50"0 of nitrate 
uptake in Thalassiosira pseudonana, Prorocentrum minimum and Skeletonema costa turn respectively, 
at irradiance levels which are typical of the primary nitrite maximum in oligotrophic oceans. In natural 
populations, nitrite excretion can represent up to 60% of nitrate uptake in surface waters of upwelling 
areas. Conversely, nitrite uptake can equal or exceed nitrate uptake in several species of marine phyto- 
plankton in cullures as well as in natural populations. The first phenomenon can lead to large. \ driations 
of the net/gross new production estimates, as well as widely biased estimates of the f ratio. For ex- 
ample, a nitrite excretion of 40% of nitrate uptake will lead to a 33";, underestimate of the f ratio in a 
range of values typical of oligotrophic oceans. The effects of nitrite uptake taking place concurrently 
with nitrate uptake are more difficult to assess, but the overall result is that f ratios in stratified oceanic 
areas are probably underestimated by the ''N tracer technique. 
KEY WORDS: Nitrite . Excretion Uptake New production 
INTRODUCTION 
The present work was inspired by the review of Platt 
et al. (1989) in which a parallel is established between 
primary production in terms of carbon and nitrogen. 
Briefly stated, Platt et al. (1989) argue that net primary 
production in terms of carbon is equivalent to total pro- 
duction in terms of nitrogen (new plus regenerated 
production sensu Dugdale & Goering 1967). In support 
of this argument, the authors point out that 'there is no 
evidence that phytoplankton remineralise nitrogen'. 
They add that 'the dist~nction (between equating nitro- 
gen production with either gross or net carbon produc- 
tion) is of significance for calculations involving the 
interconversion of carbon and nitrogen'. While the 
second point is beyond dispute, recent work on the 
nitrogen cycle (Bronk et al. 1994, Slawyk & Raimba.ult 
1995, Collos et al. 1996) has revealed that phenomena 
such as dissolved organic nitrogen excretion do affect estimates of both new and regenerated production in 
a significant way. In the present review, I examine 
another aspect of this problem, which is the release of 
nitrite during uptake of nitrate by unicellular algae in 
laboratory cultures as well as by natural marine phyto- 
plankton. 
UNICELLULAR ALGAE AS ION EXCHANGERS 
Unicellular algae are much more prone to large ex- 
changes of nitrogen with the surrounding environment 
than higher plants for 2 reasons. The first one is the 
high surface/volume ratio which makes them more 
liable to exchange material with the external medium, 
and the second reason is their low carbonhitrogen 
composition ratio relatlve to higher plants. For example, 
carbodnitrogen ratios for unicellular algae range from 
5 to 20 (Caperon & Meyer 1972, Laws & Wong 1978) 
and for higher plants from 18 to 120 (Epstein 1972, 
Newel1 et al. 1984), giving more importance to nitrogen

compounds in their overall metabolism. During assimi- 
lation of nitrate for example, they can accumulate sev- 
eral intermediate compounds during the reduction 
pathway, ultimately leading to protein synthesis (Collos 
& Slawyk 1980, Dortch et al. 1984). This accumulation 
inevitably leads to the establishment of concentration 
gradients and diffusion or leakage of material to the 
outside. However, in the case of nitrite, internal pools 
are generally undetectable in phytoplankton cells 
(Thoresen et al. 1982, Dortch et al. 1984). When de- 
tected, internal nitrite was usually found in very limited 
quantities (Eppley & Coatsworth 1968, Conover 1975), 
but there are exceptions (Flynn & Flynn 1998). In spite 
of this, nitrite release appears to be widespread in 
marine rnicroalgae. However, the mechanism of nitrite 
release is not clear. I have tried to assess the relative 
importance of active excretion versus passive diffusion 
following Bjornsen (1988) using literature data. Table 1 
shows the results of linear regressions between nitrite 
release rates (per unit volume culture) and either micro- 
algal biomass (cells 1-') or nitrate uptake rate (per liter 
of culture). The results are rather inconclusive as, in 
2 out of 3 cases, the relationship between nitrite release 
and biomass was highly significant, indicating that 
diffusion processes were more important than active 
excretion, while the third study indicated the opposite. 
In this review, nitrite release will generally be consid- 
ered as an active process depending on nitrate uptake. 
Net nitrate uptake is deflned as the rate estimated from 
ISN incorporation in phytoplankton cells and is com- 
patible with the definition of Bronk et al. (1994). 
However, in the present case, gross nitrate uptake is 
the sum of net nitrate uptake and nitrite excretion. 
Other phenomena such as cell lysis or animal feeding 
on phytoplankton which also lead to production of 
extracellular products will not be examined here. 
NITRITE EXCRETION DURING NITRATE UPTAKE 
In laboratory cultures (Table 2), the values of nitrite 
excretion as a percentage of nitrate u.ptake range between zero and 50% in the light and between zero 
and 96 % in the dark. No particular interspecific trend.s 
could be established. The high variability in values 
obtained by different investigators on the same species 
(e.g. Skeletonema costatum) may be due to several fac- 
tors. Early work carried out on batch cultures followed 
concentration changes over relatively long periods of 
time and slow changes in nutritional conditions. More 
recent work with continuous cultures has allowed the 
study of rather abrupt changes in nutrient levels by 
lmposing nutrient splkes, leading to perturbations of 
the assimilatory pathways and subsequent release of 
intermediate compounds. Those perturbations of the 
nutrient regime are thought to be representative of 
natural phenomena such as nitrate intrusions into 
the euphotic zone of stratified oceanlc areas (Dugdale 
1977, Klein 8. Coste 1984, Holligan et al. 1985). Higher 
sampling rates in more recent studies could also have 
contributed to revealing phenomena of a greater 
amplitude than previously reported. 
Nitrite excretion has been found to be greater In the 
dark than in the light for several species of marine 
microalgae (Vaccaro & Ryther 1960, Laws & Wong 
1978, Collos 1982, Raimbault 1986). ZoBell (1935) 
noted that 'the concentration of nitrite is usually great- 
est early in the morning and diminishes with exposure 
to light' in batch cultures of marine diatoms. This can 
be explained by the light requirements of nitrite reduc- 
tase. Ferredoxin, which is the electron donor for this 
enzyme, is synthesized during photosynthesis only 
(Losada et al. 1981). 
Nitrite excretion by unicellular algae may be 
highly dependent on the growth rate in the dark 
period but not in the light period (Laws & Wong 
1978). There are also large intergeneric differences 
at this level. For example, nitrite excretion was 
growth rate dependent in the light period for Proro- 
centrun] minimum (Sciandra & Amara 1994), but not 
for Pavlova lutheri (Laws & Wong 1978). Nitrite 
excretion has been shown to depend on temperature 
(Mihnea & Voinescu 1979, Raimbault 1986), the 
external nitrate concentration (Serra et al. 1978,

Except for the study of Anderson & Roels (1981), the 
irradiance level used by most investigators was 
characteristic of that prevailing in the lower euphotic 
zone in stratified oceanic areas (between 50 and 
100 pm01 m-2 S-'). In this respect, those results 
obtained in laboratory cultures are particularly 296 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 171: 293-301, 1998 
relevant to natural features such as 
the primary nitrite maximum (PNM), 
which is usually associated in these 
areas with a strong vertical nitrate 
gradient (Vaccaro 1965, Herbland & 
Voituriez 1977), indicating nitrate 
utilization. 
Field data (Table 3) are consider- 
ably less numerous, and more diffi- 
cult to interpret because ammonium

and lower (by about a factor of 2) values in the after-

I patterns are very similar to the observations of Zo- 
Bell (1935) in laboratory cultures of marine diatoms. 
In other oceanic areas such as the Subarctic Pacific, 0.9- 
Miyasaki et al. (1975) estimate that 48% of the nitrite ' 
produced in the euphotic zone is due to nitrate utili- 0.8- 
zation. In the euphotic zone of oceanic areas, nitrite 
excretion has been found to depend on nitrate con- 0.7- 
centration (Wada & Hattori 1971, Collos & Slawyk 
1983) and light (Wada & Hattori 1971, Miyasaki et al. ,% 0.6-

(0.04 to 0.60) is almost as wide as in the laboratory 0.4-

Overall, nitrite excretion by phytoplankton will lead 0.3.

In the field (Table 5), the range of 
values is similar, but here care must be 
taken due to the presence of bacterla 
which can also take up compounds 
such as nitrite. However, in the central

processes contributed to only a few 
percent of the observed nitrite uptake.

ferent from zero. While this does not preclude some 
uptake by bacteria, it suggests that it is mostly due to 
phytoplankton. Harris (1959) was probably the first to 
sh.otv that nitrite was a more important N source than 
nitrate for certain populations of marine phytoplank- 
ton, specially flagellates such as Peridinium (= Scripp- 
siella). Since then., studies on uptake of this compound 
have been surprisingly few, which is probably due to 
its low concentration in most surface waters. But Table 
5 shows that its role in phytoplankton nutrition should 
not be neglected. 
If not measured separately, nitrite uptake will lead to 
an overestimate of nitrate uptake when measured by 
the chemical method (nitrate disappearance). In the 
case of an isotop~c method such as the 15N tracer tech- 
nique (N incorporation in the particulate matter), 
several cases must be considered. If nitrite is unla- 
belled, then its uptake should not affect estimates of 
nitrate uptake, provi.ded the right equation is used 
(Collos 1987). If nitrite has the same isotopic composi- 
tion as the initial labelled nitrate, then its uptake will 
overestimate nitrate uptake, but not new production, 
because this nitrite originated from nitrate in the first 
place and should be taken into account in new produc- 
tion estimates. Both situations are extreme and the

truth lies between the two as the isotopic composition 
of nitrite will be somewhere between the natural abun- 
dance and the 15N abundance of the initial labelled 
nitrate. This makes it difficult to estimate the bias 
involved, but it is probably negligible compared to that 
due to nitrite excretion. Again, the largest errors can 
be expected to be found in oligotrophic areas at low 
vaiues of the f ratio. 
During any incubation, both nitrite excretion and 
uptake can occur sequentiaily. Figs. 2 & 3 show the 
values taken by the ratio of net/gross uptake of nitrate 
as a function of time respectively for a laboratory 
culture of Skeletonema costatum (Collos 1982) and

examples, during the first part of the incubation, when 
nltrite excretion occurs, the ratio takes on values 
smaller than 1, underestimating nitrate uptake. Con- 
versely, towards the end of the incubation, when nitrite 
is taken up simultaneously with nitrate, the ratio of 
net/gross uptake takes on values greater than 1. In 
both instances, the error can reach 100%. This is valid 
for the nitrate uptake estimate by chemical methods Collos: Nitrite excretion and new production 299 
(substrate disappearance) if nitrite is not measured 
separately, but the magnitude of the error involved 
during nitrite excretion should be the same for tracer 
methods (I5N isotope incorporation) because the ''N 
label coming originally from nitrate will be lost from 
the particulate matter as '" nitrite is excreted. 
DISCUSSION 
The present review indicates that nitrite release by 
phytoplankton during nitrate uptake leads to under- 
estimates of net nitrate uptake by chemical or isotopic 
methods in a significant way. The generally low inter- 
nal nitrite concentrations found in phytoplankton seem 
to argue against any possible methodological problem 
such as cell rupture during filtration which is still a 
matter of controversy in measurements of dissolved 
organic nitrogen (DON) for example (Sharp 1977, 
Aaronson 1978, Lancelot 1983). In extreme cases of 
very fragile planktonic organisms, vacuum filtration 
was shown to lead to large losses of particulate matter 
and 4- to 5-fold increases in DON, but no parallel 
increases in nitrite (Wilkerson & Grunseich 1990), 
when compared to gravity filtration. 
In comparison with the effect of DON release on net 
nitrate uptake (Bronk et al. 1994, Slawyk & Rairnbault 
1995, Collos et al. 1996), the effect of nitrite excretion 
can be as great or even greater. It can be seen from 
Figs. 2 & 3 that the net/gross ratio can reach values 
which are lower than those mentioned in Bronk et al. 
(1994) for a variety of environments. In addition, sub- 
sequent uptake of previously excreted nitrite will also 
affect estimates of net uptake in that the net/gross 
uptake ratio can take on values greater than 1 (up to 
3.0 in the case of natural populations of marine phyto- 
plankton in an upwelling area), thereby overestimat- 
ing nitrate uptake. 
The first phenomenon is likely to lead to bias in esti- 
mates of net nitrate uptake during both field and 
laboratory incubations. The magnitude of the bias will 
probably depend on the magnitude of the nitrate addi- 
tion relative to the initial concentration. Concerning 
the second phenomenon, effects are more diffic.ult to 
assess but are likely to be less serious for 2 reasons. 
First, any uptake of previously excreted nitrite will 
tend to compensate the effects of excretion. Secondly, 
field investigators generally try to avoid substrate 
exhaustion during their measurements, so that high 
ratios of relative nitrite uptake such as those shown in 
Tables 4 & 5 should be rare. However, problems may 
arise in laboratory experiments when nitrate spikes are 
imposed on a nitrogen limited or a nitrogen starved 
culture and concentrations followed until substrate 
exhaustion is reached in order to estimate nitrate uptake kinetics from changes in concentrations (Collos 
1982). In those situations, the patterns shown in Figs. 2 
& 3 fully apply. 
In conclusion, it appears that nitrite excretion and 
uptake can influence net nitrate uptake estimates at 
least as much as DON release, and this should be 
taken into account in the experimental design of 
measurements of new production. This phenomenon is 
probably most important in stratified oceanic areas 
where intrusion of nitrate at the bottom of the euphotic 
zone will lead to perturbation of the nutrient regime 
and subsequent disequilibria in the assimilation path- 
way of the phytoplankton.
