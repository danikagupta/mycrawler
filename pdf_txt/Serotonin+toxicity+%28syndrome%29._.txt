Clinical Updateith the introduction of numerous serotonergic agents in
the past two decades, serotonin toxicity1 has be come
an important and common adverse drug effect, which
can be mild, moderate or even life-threatening. Serotonin toxicity
can occur from an overdose, drug interaction or adverse drug
effect involving serotonergic agents. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the commonest groups of drugs taken
in overdose,2 a n d  s e r o t o n i n  t o x i c i t y  o c c u r s  i n  1 5 %  o f  S S R I
overdoses.3 A growing list of medications has been associated with
serotonergic toxicity; the drugs that have been clearly associated
are given in Box 1. The potential for the development of serotonin
toxicity is particularly important in patients being prescribed
psychotropic medications, with an increasing proportion of the
population taking the newer antidepressants.4
Serotonin toxicity results from an excess of serotonin (5-hydroxy-
tryptamine [5-HT]) in the central nervous system (CNS), which can
be due to several different pharmacological mechanisms. These
include inhibition of the metabolism of serotonin (monoamine
oxidase inhibitors), prevention of the reuptake of serotonin in nerve
terminals (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and increased serotonin
precursors (tryptophan) or serotonin release (serotonin-releasing
agents) (Box 2). The resulting excess CNS serotonin acts on
serotonin receptors and produces the clinical effects. The exact role
of the various serotonin receptors is not completely clear, but there
is good evidence that the severe life-threatening clinical effects,
such as rigidity and hyperthermia, are mediated by the 5-HT2A
receptors.1,5
Serotonin toxicity is sometimes called the serotonin syndrome,
which is often used to refer to clinical effects “as defined by the
Sternbach criteria”.6 H o w e v e r ,  t h e s e  c r i t e r i a  w e r e  s t a t e d  t o  b e
provisional, are non-specific and have never been validated (see
Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity ). The clinical features reported in
the original description of the serotonin syndrome by Sternbach
have often been taken as diagnostic criteria, which has led to some
reported associations with medications that clearly do not cause
serotonin excess. The atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as olanza-
pine, are a striking example. These have been reported as causing
the serotonin syndrome,7 despite having antiserotonergic actions.
We contend that the diagnostic criteria developed more recently by
our group — the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria2 — are much
more specific for serotonin toxicity .
Clinical features of serotonin toxicity
Serotonin toxicity is characterised by the presence of a triad of
clinical features: neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimula-
tion, and changes in mental state (Box 3). There are a number of
specific neurological signs that are not seen in many other
conditions that should direct the clinician towards a diagnosis of
serotonin toxicity . The most important is generalised hyperreflexia.
Sustained clonus is usually found at the ankle; ocular clonus (or
non-directional nystagmus) is also very common. Generalised
spontaneous clonus may occur in moderate-to-severe cases, and is
seen rarely in any condition other than serotonin toxicity .2 T h elower limbs usually have a much greater degree of hyperreflexia
and clonus than the upper limbs8 (although a mechanism for this
consistent observation is not known).
Some mental state and autonomic features are also nearly always
present, but have lower diagnostic utility , as they are indistinguish-
able from those observed with other causes of an agitated delirium.
However, the presence of these features is often associated with
moderate-to-severe serotonin toxicity .
Assessment of serotonin toxicity: diagnosis and severity
The assessment of serotonin toxicity requires determining, first,
whether the clinical features are consistent with serotonin toxicity
and, second, the severity of the toxicity . In patients with suspected
serotonin toxicity , the clinical assessment should include observa-
tion for tremor, myoclonic jerks, diaphoresis, ocular clonus andSerotonin toxicity:
a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment

ABSTRACT•Excess serotonin in the central nervous system leads to a 
condition commonly referred to as the serotonin syndrome, 
but better described as a spectrum of toxicity — serotonin 
toxicity.
•Serotonin toxicity is characterised by neuromuscular 
excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity), 
autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, 
diaphoresis, tremor, flushing) and changed mental state 
(anxiety, agitation, confusion).
•Serotonin toxicity can be: mild (serotonergic features that 
may or may not concern the patient); moderate (toxicity which 
causes significant distress and deserves treatment, but is not 
life-threatening); or severe (a medical emergency 
characterised by rapid onset of severe hyperthermia, muscle 
rigidity and multiple organ failure).
•Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity is often made on the basis of 
the presence of at least three of Sternbach’s 10 clinical 
features. However, these features have very low specificity. 
The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria use a smaller, more 
specific set of clinical features for diagnosis, including clonus, 
which has been found to be more specific to serotonin 
toxicity.
•There are several drug mechanisms that cause excess 
serotonin, but severe serotonin toxicity only occurs with 
combinations of drugs acting at different sites, most 
commonly including a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and a 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Less severe toxicity occurs with 
other combinations, overdoses and even single-drug therapy 
in susceptible individuals.
•Treatment should focus on cessation of the serotonergic 
medication and supportive care. Some antiserotonergic 
agents have been used in clinical practice, but the preferred

agitation. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure and temperature)
will usually be sufficient to diagnose autonomic features. However,
most important is a focused neurological examination — mental
state (eg, orientation, concentration, short-term memory); upper-
and lower-limb tone, clonus and reflexes; and pupillary size,
reaction and extraocular movements (opsoclonus). In most cases
this is sufficient to make a confident diagnosis.2
Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity
A number of diagnostic criteria have been suggested for serotonin
toxicity . The first and most commonly used are Sternbach’s
criteria.6 Many of the 1 0 clinic al feature s sugge sted as  typica l o f
serotonin toxicity by Sternbach are non-specific. These would also
be commonly observed in many other conditions such as anti-
cholinergic delirium, and alcohol and drug withdrawal states.2
Sternbach’s clinical definition was based on case reports and small
published case series. Sternbach recognised that the features were
non-specific and specified that other possible causes of the features
must be excluded. Unfortunately , this caveat on the original
description is almost routinely ignored. Thus, while Sternbach’s
criteria remain useful for early recognition, they cannot by defini-
tion be used in differential diagnosis.1
As the clinical features of Sternbach’s criteria are not specific,
they are also not useful for identifying new drugs as a cause of
serotonin toxicity . Again, by definition they state that a known
serotonergic drug must have been recently added or increased in
dose. The folly of ignoring these two components of the syndrome
definition is well illustrated by the fact that eight of the 10
“diagnostic” clinical features of the Sternbach serotonin syndrome
are common features of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontin-
uation syndrome, and five are in the proposed diagnostic criteria
for that syndrome.9 In addition, eight of Sternbach’ s 10 “diagnos-
tic” features can occur with catecholamine excess, and many
features are found in other common toxidromes.
We recently developed diagnostic criteria for serotonin toxicity
— the Hunter Serotonin T oxicity Criteria (HSTC) — by studying
large numbers of patients ingesting serotonergic agents in over-dose. The HSTC can be used to determine whether a patient who
has taken an overdose has significant serotonin toxicity (Box 4).2
As the HSTC were validated in the setting of a toxicology service
where other drug-induced syndromes are frequent, the criteria are
much more specific than Sternbach’ s criteria for features that solely
relate to serotonin toxicity . Because they are more specific, the
HSTC can be used for adverse drug reactions, but have not been
validated for this purpose.
Differential diagnosis
Although other adverse drug reactions can be initially mistaken for
serotonin toxicity , a careful examination for specific neurological
features, such as clonus, hyperreflexia and tone, makes it possible
to distinguish other conditions. A list of differential diagnoses is
given in Box 5. The most commonly confused neurotoxic syn-
drome is the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, neurolep-
tic malignant syndrome is associated with bradykinesia, lead pipe
rigidity, and other extrapyramidal features, in contrast to the
hyperkinesia, hyperreflexia and clonus seen with serotonin toxic-1D r u g s  t h a t  h a v e  b e e n  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  s e r o t o n i n

ity. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is also an idiosyncratic
adverse drug reaction that has a more gradual onset and is not
associated with overdoses of neuroleptics.
Non-convulsive seizures (toxic ictal delirium) may present as a
severe fluctuating acute confusional state, which may be associated
with autonomic features, hyperreflexia or occasional overt seizure
activity . Although the many non-drug causes of non-convulsive
status epilepticus (including most causes of encephalopathy)10,11
must be excluded, drugs may induce this epileptic phenomenon,
either dose-related or in withdrawal. The most common drug
associations are with recently increased doses of phenothiazines
and with benzodiazepine withdrawal.12 It seems likely that some
serotonergic drugs may also occasionally cause this syndrome. An
electroencephalogram at the time is usually diagnostic, and rapid
improvement with administration of benzodiazepines is usual. The
latter may be the best way to clinically distinguish non-convulsive
seizures from serotonin toxicity .12
Acute baclofen withdrawal (typically due to intrathecal pump
failure) is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with
a raised temperature, autonomic instability and muscle spasms
and rigidity .13,14 T h e  c l i n i c a l  f e a t u r e s  a r e  d i f f i c u l t  t o  d i s t i n g u i s h
from serotonin toxicity , but this rare diagnosis need only be
considered in a few patients, and it should respond rapidly to
reinstitution of baclofen. Interestingly , it has also been reported to
respond to serotonin antagonists,14 suggesting that it may even be
a specific form of serotonin toxicity .
Severity of serotonin toxicity
The spectrum of serotonin toxicity can be roughly divided into
three groups of severity based on the requirement for medical
intervention:
•Mild serotonergic features.  These may or may not interfere
with the patient and may occur with therapeutic use of many
serotonergic agents.•Moderate toxicity.  S y m p t o m s  c a u s e  t h e  p a t i e n t  s i g n i f i c a n t
distress and deserve symptomatic treatment.
•Severe serotonin toxicity or serotonin crisis.1 This is charac-
terised by a rapidly increasing temperature associated with muscle
rigidity , and will progress to multiorgan failure if not treated within
hours. This is a medical emergency and is almost exclusively
associated with combinations of drugs acting at different sites, most
commonly including a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and an SSRI.15
A similar division was also suggested by Radomski and col-
leagues, labelled as mild serotonin toxicity , serotonin syndrome,
and toxic states.16 A number of other scoring systems have been
suggested; for example, a serotonin toxicity scale devised by
Hegerl and coworkers for depressed patients taking paroxetine.17
Serotonin toxicity occurs in three main settings. Adverse reac-
tions to normal therapeutic doses usually only cause mild-to-
moderate toxicity . Overdose of a single serotonergic agent typically
leads to moderate toxicity only . Nearly all severe serotonin toxicity
relates to drug interactions (which may also occur in overdose).
There are a number of different mechanisms by which the drugs
associated with serotonin toxicity (Box 1) cause excess serotonin.
As mentioned above, severe serotonin toxicity mostly occurs with
combinations of drugs (most commonly an SSRI and a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor) acting at different sites.15 P a t ie nt s  w h o  i n g e s t
any combination of serotonergic drugs in overdose must be
observed carefully . However, not all combinations cause increased
toxicity . For example, although methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA; ecstasy) can cause serotonin toxicity , SSRIs do not appear
to increase serotonergic effects from such serotonergic ampheta-
mines and may reduce neurotoxicity .18,19
That single agents are unlikely to cause severe serotonin toxicity
has been confirmed in studies of overdose patients ingesting SSRIs
alone.2,3 I n  o n e  s t u d y  o f  S S R I  o v e r d o s e s ,  s e r o t o n i n  t o x i c i t y
occurred in 15% of cases, but there were no severe cases.3
Treatment
Treatment for all forms of serotonin toxicity is supportive care and
cessation of any serotonergic medications. Severe serotonin toxic-
ity or serotonin crisis is a medical emergency and initial manage-4F l o w  d i a g r a m  b a s e d  o n  t h e  H u n t e r  S e r o t o n i n

ment must focus on airway , breathing and circulation. Supportive
care, including passive and active cooling of the patient, sedation,
intubation and muscle paralysis, must take precedence over any
specific pharmacological treatment. Hyperthermia and muscle
rigidity appear to be the most important effects, and this support-
ive care can prevent secondary complications, such as rhabdomy-
olysis, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Serotonin toxicity may progressively increase over a number of
hours after ingestion of implicated drugs. Patients who have
moderate serotonin toxicity should be observed for a period of 6
hours; however, if a slow-release formulation has been ingested,
such as venlafaxine, observation should be continued for 12 hours.
It is appropriate to provide symptomatic treatment for these
patients, including benzodiazepine sedatives, antiemetics and spe-
cific pharmacological therapy . Most patients will improve within
24 hours of ceasing the serotonergic medication.
There may be a role for specific serotonin antagonists in
serotonin toxicity , and animal studies provide data that non-
specific HT2-antagonists and more selective 5-HT2A-antagonists
reverse the lethal effects of serotonin toxicity .5 There are numerous
case reports of patients improving after being given serotonin
antagonists.20-24 H o w e v e r ,  i t  i s  d i f f i c u l t  t o  s e p a r a t e  t h e s e
“responses” from the natural resolution of toxicity . There are no
controlled trials demonstrating their effectiveness and further
study is required. Cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine are the
HT2-antagonists that have been used most extensively ,20,23,25 and
have a long history of safe use for other medical conditions. Oral
cyproheptadine (4–12 mg) is probably the most useful 5-HT2
antagonist for moderate toxicity . Its main side effect is sedation,
which is usually beneficial. However, as cyproheptadine can only
be administered orally , it is unlikely to be effective in patients
administered activated charcoal, and has limited use in severe
toxicity . In severe serotonin toxicity , chlorpromazine may be more
appropriate to use for sedation than other routine sedative agents.
It can cause hypotension, so patients must receive sufficient
volume loading. Other non-selective 5-HT2 a n t a go ni s t s ,  s u c h  a s
the atypical antipsychotics, may be effective,21,22 but t he re is fa r
less experience with their use.
In patients who ingest overdoses of serotonergic agents, there
are a few additional considerations. The selective use of activated
charcoal may be warranted, but only if it can be given within an
hour. Early risk assessment should also consider the possibility of
interacting drugs, and non-serotonergic toxic effects (eg, QT
prolongation with citalopram).26
Some individuals appear to be more susceptible to mild-to-
moderate serotonin toxicity , but it is unclear whether this usually
has a pharmacokinetic (eg, decreased drug metabolism) or phar-
macodynamic (eg, serotonin receptor polymorphism) explana-
tion.27 A  g r e a t  d e a l  o f  r e s e a r c h  w o u l d  b e  n e e d e d  t o  e n a b l e
identification of such individuals before treatment. Until then,
prevention of serotonin toxicity is as simple (or as difficult) as
avoiding prescribing serotonergic drugs. However, we believe that
avoiding monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be sufficient to
prevent life-threatening toxicity . It also makes sense to us to
generally minimise the use of serotonergic drugs used for non-
psychiatric conditions.
