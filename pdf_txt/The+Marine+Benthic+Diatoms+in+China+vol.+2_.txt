  Abstract        We studied diatom distribution from 62 samples from the uppermost 1 cm of sediment in the 
South China Sea (SCS), using grabs or box corers in three cruises between 2001–2007. Fifty six genera, 256 species and their varieties were identi ﬁ ed. Dominating species included    C  oscinodiscus    africanus  , 
 C  oscinodiscus    nodulifer  ,  C  yclotella    stylorum  ,  H  emidiscus    cuneiformis  ,  M  elosira    sulcata  ,  N  itzschia   
 marina  ,  R  operia    tesselata  ,  T  halassionema    nitzschioides  ,  T  halassiosira    e  x  centrica  , and  T  halassiothrix   
 longissima  . Most surface sediments in the SCS were rich in diatoms, except for a few coarse samples. 
Average diatom abundance in the study area was 104 607 valve/g. In terms of the abundance, ecology, and spatial distribution, seven diatom zones (Zones 1–7) were recognized. Zone 1 (northern continental shelf) is affected by warm currents, SCS northern branch of the Kuroshio, and northern coastal currents; Zone 2 (northwestern continental shelf) is affected by intense coastal currents; Zone 3 (Xisha Islands sea area) is a bathyal environment with transitional water masses; Zone 4 (sea basin) is a bathyal-to-deep sea with stable and uniform central water masses in a semi-enclosed marginal sea; Zone 5 (Nansha Islands marine area) is a pelagic environment with relatively high surface temperature; Zone 6 (northern Sunda Shelf) is a tropical shelf environment; and Zone 7 (northern Kalimantan Island shelf area) is affected by warm waters from the Indian Ocean and coastal waters. The data indicate that these diatom zones are closely related to topography, hydrodynamics, temperature, nutrients and especially the salinity. Better understanding of the relationship between diatom distribution and the oceanographic factors would help in the reconstruction of the SCS in the past.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
 The South China Sea (SCS), the largest marginal 
sea of the western Paci ﬁ c, plays a key role in climate 
change in East Asia, and is a natural experimental site for research into the driving forces and regional responses to global change (Zhao and Wang, 1999). Various forms of marine life in the SCS have been studied, such as foraminifera (Jian and Wang, 1997), radiolarians (Wang and Abelmann, 2002) and calcareous nannofossils (Wei et al., 1997). However, available data on diatoms are very limited.  Diatoms are microscopic algae found in almost all 
aquatic and most wet terrestrial habitats. Each habitat has its own chemical and physical environment and is represented by its own characteristic diatom ﬂ ora. 
Opaline silica skeletons preserved in sediments contain paleoenvironmental information (Stoermer

40676026, 41076079, 40831160519) and the Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (No. 2010CB428704)  ** Corresponding author: gaoyh@xmu.edu.cn ; landz@public.xm.fj.cn32 CHIN. J. OCEANOL. LIMNOL., 31(1), 2013 V ol.31
and Smol, 1999). Therefore, research on diatom 
assemblages in surface sediments is important for reconstructing the local environmental changes. 
 This research covered mainly the northern part of 
the SCS, spanning 3°56.61 ′–20°59.37 ′N, 108°30.68 ′–
116°46.70 ′E. It was performed in a large-scale and 
comprehensive manner on surface sediment diatoms to identify the factors affecting their preservation and better understand how the diatom record changes with time.  
 2 TECTONIC SETTING 
 The SCS is the largest marginal sea in the world, 
with a surface area of approximately 3.5×10 6  km 2 . 
The main basin extends from the equator along the northwestern coast of Borneo to approximately 23°N along the southern coast of China, and from near to 105°E along the coast of the Indochinese Peninsula to 120°E along the eastern coast of the Philippines. The deepest basin, located in the northeast, is reported as 5 000 m deep. The shelf is narrow, with area of 1.2×10 
6  km 2  (Shaw and Chao, 1994), and is separated 
from the western Paci ﬁ c to the east and the Indian 
Ocean to the south by a series of sills. The climate and surface-water circulation in the SCS are largely controlled by monsoons which driven by differential heating in adjacent continents and oceans (Wytki, 1961), and characterized by abnormal rain and wind patterns in summer and winter of monsoon years. The northeast and southwest monsoons change the surface-water circulation regularly, bringing in water into the SCS from the western Paci ﬁ c (including 
probably the warm Kuroshio (Wytki, 1961) through the Bashi Strait, north of Luzon) and Indian Ocean surface water across the Sunda Shelf in summer (Wang and Abelmann, 2002).  
 The topography of SCS is complex. The northern 
or northwestern and southwestern margins are ﬂ at 
continental shelves, which transform to slopes from 150 m depth. The boundary between slope and basin is approximately at the 3 200 m isobath in the west, and at 3 600 m in the center. The continental slope contains submarine plateaus, troughs, and trenches. Abyssal plains are widely distributed at the bottom of the deep-sea basin, and many seamounts rise above the seabed for a few kilometers (Mao et al., 1982). Because of different effects of these water systems, temperature and salinity of the SCS are high in the south and low in the north. From North to South, average surface temperatures vary from 22.6 to 27.1°C and average salinities from 29 to 33.5.  3 MATERIAL AND METHOD 
 3.1 Sampling and sample processing 
 Diatom samples (Fig.1; Table 1) were taken from 
the uppermost 1-cm sediment collected with a grab or a box corer during cruises on R/Vs  Ocean   -4  in 2000–
2001,  Shiyan   -3  in 2007, and  Yanping   -2  in 2007. The 
sampling stations lay between 3°56.61 ′–20°59.37 ′N, 
108°30.68 ′–116°46.70 ′E. The sampling depths ranged 
from 101 to 4 185 m. Samples were prepared according to Håkansson (1984). All the samples were treated with 10% HCl to remove calcareous matter and treated with 30% H 
2 O 2  (1–2 h in a water bath at 
60°C) to remove organic material. Very clayey samples were washed repeatedly with distilled water in a 100-mL beaker to suspend and disperse the clay material. The supernatant was decanted off after at least 3 h, and the aliquot of the suspension was shaken, smeared on a cover slip, and dried. After the materials were completely dried, samples were mounted with Naphrax (Håkansson, 1984).  
 3.2 Diatom analysis 
 Diatoms were identi ﬁ ed and counted with an 
Olympus BX-51 microscope on phase contrast at magni ﬁ cation of 1000×. More than 300 diatom valves 
were counted for each sample, and the counts were converted to percentage abundances (Lapointe, 2000; Jiang, 2001). For samples containing very few diatoms, all diatoms on the entire slide were counted. The row numbers for counting diatoms were randomly chosen for statistical purposes (Lapointe, 2000). 
 The absolute number of diatom valves per gram of 
sediment was calculated as follows: the number of valve/g=(( N ×( S / s ))×( V / v ))×1 000/ w:  N  is the number 
of diatom valves observed;  S  is the total number of 
rows divided per slide;  s  is the number of rows in 
which diatoms were counted;  V  is the total volume;  v  
is the volume of solution placed onto cover slip; and  w  is the dry weight of the sample. Relative abundances 
of individual taxa are given as percentages (Abrantes et al., 2007). 
 For an incomplete valve, the centric diatoms were 
counted as representing the whole specimen if more than half of the valve was observed (including the central area). Pinnate diatoms were counted as half if only a single apex was found on the valve (Lopes, 2006). Whenever possible, each specimen was identi ﬁ ed to species level; otherwise, it was assigned 
to a genus. Because of dif ﬁ culties in classifying 
 Chaetoceros   resting spores, all of them were recorded 33 No.1   WU et al.  :   Diatom assemblages in surface sediments from the SCS as environmental indicators    
as spores of  Chaetoceros   (Nave et al., 2001). 
 Diatom taxonomy and ecological af ﬁ nity 
information followed Jin et al. (1965, 1982, 1992), Lan et al. (1995), Schmidt (1874–1959), Hustedt (1930), Mann (1925), van Heurck (1896), Metzeltin et al. (1998) and Round et al. (1990).  3.3 Grain size analysis 
 Grain size and detrital mineral analyses were 
conducted according to the Speci ﬁ cations for 
Oceanographic Survey (No. GB/T 13909-92, National Standard of China). Subsamples for grain size

analysis were sampled, dried, weighed, mixed with 
sodium hexametaphosphate and water, soaked, and sieved through a 63- μm mesh. The grains retained on 
the sieve (>63 μm) were analyzed after being dried, 
and the grains passing through the mesh (<63 μm) 
were analyzed using a Mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer (measurement range, 0.02–2 000 μm). The results of grain size 
analysis were plotted on the Wentworth scale, and the sediments were classi ﬁ ed using the Shepard 
triangular diagram.  4 RESULT 
 4.1 Bottom sediment types 
 Six main types of sediments in SCS were classi ﬁ ed 
according to grain size (Medium- ﬁ ne Sand, Fine Sand, 
Silty Sand, Sandy Silt, Silt, and Clayey Silt). They were distributed in an obvious zonation. Coarse-grained sediments of sand or silty sand were mainly distributed in the southwest Sunda shelf, the Mekong River mouth, and the northern part of the SCS, as well as some local  Table 1 Details of diatom samples in surface sediment in the SCS

reefs in the Nansha undersea plateau district; ﬁ ne-
grained silts were mainly distributed from the continental slope to the deep-sea basin. Fine-grained sediments were mainly distributed in the central basin, the eastern part of the Indo-China Peninsula and the Nansha Islands. In general, grain size of surface sediment samples was coarse, but varied greatly in some areas. Silt content was over 50% in most stations, 40% in Station SA14-19 only, 30% in a few stations in the sea basin and in southeastern Indochina (e.g., NS2007-22, SA08-20, SA08-26, and SA13-53) and 20%–30% in many other stations. Clay content was 
very low, indicating strong hydrodynamics in the SCS. 
 4.2 Absolute abundance in surface sediments 
 Most surface sediments in the SCS contained a 
signiﬁ cant number of diatoms, and only few samples 
with coarse granularity contained a small number of diatoms. Difference in distribution of diatom abundance was signi ﬁ cant (Table 2). For example, 
diatom abundance in Station SA09-089 on the continental shelf was only 71 valve/g, whereas that Station YSJD18 in southern sea basin was 623 438 valve/g. The average diatom abundance of the study area was 104 607 valve/g. 
 Diatom abundance tended to increase from shelf to 
basin (Table 3). The most southern parts of the study area, north of the Kalimantan, are in insular outer shelf with silty sand sediments. Here, the average abundance of diatoms was 291 valve/g, the lowest in the study area. In the southwestern part of the study area on the shallow areas of Sunda Shelf and northern continental shelf, sediments were coarser, mostly silty and medium– ﬁ ne-grained sands; diatom species were 
few, with low average abundances of 352 and 907 valve/g, respectively. In the outer shelf and slope (the northwestern part of the study area) sediments were ﬁ ne-grained clay silt. Here, the average diatom 
abundance increased to 3 124 valve/g. The areas off southeastern Hainan Island and Xisha Islands are parts of the continental slope at depths of 500–1 800 m. Sediments here were mainly ﬁ ne-grained 
and the distribution of diatoms was patchy: ~100 000 valve/g in deeper stations and ~5 000 valve/g in shallower stations; on average, 83 606 valve/g. In the Nansha basin area, sediment was clayey silt and average diatom abundance was 197 239 valve/g. In the islands, reefs, and seamounts between the north and south basins in the Nansha Islands, where sediment grain size varied greatly, the abundance was 210 000 valve/g. 
 4.3 Distribution of dominant diatom species  
 In total, 256 species and varieties of diatoms from 
56 genera were identi ﬁ ed. According to Pokras et al. 
(1986), a particular species is considered dominant when its relative percentage reaches 10%, or 5% if bearing certain environmental implications. Therefore, the 10 most dominant species in this case were  C  oscinodiscus    africanus  ,  C  oscinodiscus   
 nodulifer  ,  C  yclotella    stylorum  ,  H  emidiscus    Table 2 Diatom abundance in surface sediments in SCS

of these species are as follows: 
 (1)  Coscinodiscus    africanus   Janisch ex A.Schmidt 
1878 is a thermophilic species (Lan, 1995), more abundant in the southern region of the SCS, and concentrated in the area 7°48.56 ′–9°58.40′N, 
113°22.29 ′–116°46.70 ′E. Its abundance accounted for 
0.9%–5.6% of all species in the Xisha Islands area.  C .  africanus   abundance was the lowest (0%–2.5%) in 
the northern regions of the SCS and Sunda Shelf, which are easily affected by coastal currents because of the shallow depth. The species was not detected in the northwestern continental shelf (shallow water area) and northern Kalimantan Island shelf. Previous studies have shown that this species is widely distributed in the western Paci ﬁ c (5°N–4°S) and 
eastern Paci ﬁ c (15°N–7°S) (Jousé et al., 1969, 1971), 
as well as in the areas of in ﬂ ow of the warm Kuroshio 
in the East China Sea (Jin, 1980). 
 (2)  Coscinodiscus      nodulifer   A. Schmidt 1886 is a 
thermophilic species (Lan, 1995). It was the most abundant and widely distributed species, found in all stations. However, its distribution was uneven, generally greater than 10% in every station with a peak value 62.5% in Station SA09-46. Its relative abundance was high in the deep-sea area of Nansha basin, ranging from 16.3%–50.6%, and in the Xisha area (28.8%–51.7%). In addition, it accounted for 12.5%–36.4% of all diatoms in the northern Kalimantan Island shelf area. Its abundance was 
relatively low in the northern continental shelf shallow sea area, northwestern continental shelf, and northern Sunda Shelf (1.9%–21.4%, 0.7%–19%, and 4.6%–62.5%, respectively). 
 (3)  Cyclotella    s  tylorum   Brightwell 1860 is a 
eurythermal and coastal species (Lan, 1995), found mainly in the northwestern continental shelf, comprising 42%–73.1% of the total in that area. In other marine areas, it was relatively less abundant, accounting for 0%–7.1% in the neritic area of the northern continental shelf, for 0.4%–11.8% on the northern Sunda continental shelf and for 0.2%–7.1% in the Nansha basins. It was even less abundant in Xisha Islands region, being absent in some stations, while it reached 10.2% in only one station. This species was nearly undetectable in the northern Kalimantan Island shelf area. 
 (4)  Hemidiscus    cuneiformis     Wallich 1860 is a 
thermophilic species (Lan, 1995) distributed throughout the whole survey area. It comprised 1.5%–11.8% of the total species in the northern continental shelf, 0%–1% in the northwestern continental shelf, 0.6%–4.6% in Nansha Islands, 1.3%–13% in Xisha Islands and 0.8%–18.2% in the northern Kalimantan Island shelf area (excepting Station SA09-100). 
 (5)  M e losira    sulcata   (Ehr.) Kützing   1844 is a 
eurythermal and coastal species (Lan, 1995). It was 
the second most abundant species in the SCS next to  C .  nodulifer  , except at several stations (SA09-046, 
SA09-087, SA09-089, SA09-091, and SA09-098) on  Table 3 Diatom abundance and sediment types in different topography of surface sediments of SCS

the Sunda Shelf and the northern Kalimantan Island 
shelf area. It accounted for 5.7%–35.3% of the species in the northern continental shelf and 0.7%–19% of those in the northwestern continental shelf. In deep-sea areas, the abundance varied considerably: 1.6%–13.8% in the Xisha area, 0.6%–11% in the Nansha sea basin and 0.8%–8.4% in the Nansha Islands. 
 (6)  Nitzschia    marina     Grunow 1880   is a thermophilic 
species (Lan, 1995) which varied greatly in SCS: 0.2%–4% in deep sea areas, scarce or absent in neritic areas such as the Sunda and north Kalimantan Island Shelves. It was also scarce in the northern continental shelf and absent in the northwestern continental shelf. 
 (7)  R  operia    tesselata   (Rop.) Grunow 1881, a 
thermophilic species (Lan, 1995) similar to  N .  marina  , 
distributed in deep-sea areas of the SCS. It was highly concentrated in the Nansha area, accounting for 3%–9.8% of the species, and 1.4%–7.8% in the Xisha area. Its abundance was low on the continental shelf area, such as in the northern mainland (0%–7.1%), sporadic in some parts of the northwestern continental shelf, and it was missing in all the northern Kalimantan Island shelf area. 
 (8)  T  halassionema    n  itzschioides     (Rop.) Grunow 
1880, a eurythermal species (Lan, 1995), was mainly seen in the Nansha Islands (average 2%) and Xisha Islands (1.5%) areas and was rare in the neritic area of the continental shelf. 
 (9)  T  halassiosira    e  x  centrica     (Ehr.) Cleve 1904, a 
eurythermal species (Lan, 1995) was distributed mainly in the Nansha (1.4%–8.6%) and Xisha (1.1%–6.8%) areas. Only a small amount of this species was found in neritic area of the continental shelf. Its distribution was similar to that of  T .  longissima   and  R .  tesselata  , being mainly seen in deep-sea areas. 
 (10)  T  halassiothrix    longissima   Cleve et Grunow 
1880, is a eurythermal species (Lan, 1995) concentrated and distributed in all stations in Nansha area at 0.7%–11.8% relative abundance. It was common in the Xisha area (0.6%–11.2%), and found in two deep stations in the Sunda Shelf, in one station in the northwestern continental shelf, but not found in the northern continental shelf. 
 In summary,  C .  nodulifer   was the dominant diatom 
species being widely distributed at over 10% relative abundance throughout the survey area. Other dominant species tended to be concentrated in certain sea areas. This difference provides a basis for combination partitioning. 
 4.4 Autecology of the dominant diatom species in 
the SCS 
 The dominant diatoms in the SCS and the ecological 
implications reported previously and this study are listed in Table 4. 
 4.5 Patterns of diatom assemblage distribution  
 Diatom assemblages in the study area could be 
divided into seven zones from north to south in terms of percentage and spatial distribution of dominant species, and the members of thermophilic, warm water, eurythermal, or coastal species (Fig.2). 
  Zone 1   :   Melosira      sulcata  ––  Coscinodiscus    
  nodulifer   ––  Pyxidicula      weyprechtii   ––  Diploneis    
  crabro  ––  Hemidiscus      cuneiformis   (northern 
continental shelf) 
 This zone contained a very diverse diatom 
assemblage, with 46 species (mostly benthic) with  Table 4 Autecology of the dominant diatom species in the SCS

relative abundance greater than 1%.  M .  sulcata   
accounted for 5.7%–35.3% of the assemblage;  C .  nodulifer   for 9%–21.4%;  P .  weyprechtii   Grunow, a 
eurythermal and coastal species, for 1.9%–19.1%;  D  iploneis    crabro     Ehrenberg, also a eurythermal and 
coastal species, for 0%–13.2%. Furthermore,  H .  cuneiformis   accounted for 1.5%–11.8% of the total in the zone;  C .  radiatus     Ehrenberg, a warm-water 
species, comprised 0%–11.3%; and  R .  tesselata  , 
another warm-water species, comprised 0%–7%. A number of other eurythermal and coastal species, such as  Ditylum    brightwelli   i    (West) Grunow,  Surirella

 Actinoptychus    undulatus     (Bailey) Ralfs, and

 Trachyneis    antillarum     Cleve, were also identi ﬁ ed.  
 The high percentage of eurythermal to warm-water 
species indicated that this zone, located in the shallow shelf area of the northern South China Sea, was mostly affected by warm currents of the SCS, while the high percentage of coastal species indicating the inﬂ uence of the northern coastal ﬂ ow. Several 
freshwater  Concentricystes   spp. of various 
temperature preferences were also detected, indicating that the environment of this zone is also in ﬂ uenced by 
freshwater masses.  
  Zone 2   :   C  yclotella      stylorum  –– Melosira      sulcata  ––
 Coscinodiscus      nodulifer  –– Pyxidicula      weyprechtii   
(northwest continental shelf) 
 The average diatom abundance was greater than 
that of the northern continental shelf, ranging 3 123–2 273 valve/g and quite evenly distributed. There were less diatom species than in the neritic area in the northern continental shelf. Only 14 species reached 1% relative abundance.  C .  stylorum   was the dominant 
species, reaching 73.1% (highest content in the study area) at Station SA12-32 near Hainan Island. Its lowest abundance was 42%. The second most dominant species was  M .  sulcata  , accounting for 
9.8%–18.4%.  C .  nodulifer   accounted for 10%, and 
 P .  weyprechtii   accounted for 2%–2.9%.  
 Zone 2 was located in the northwestern South 
China Sea, near the outer shelf and upper continental slope edge of the Indo-china Peninsula at depths of 138–635 m. The dominant species being coastal diatoms indicates that this zone is mainly affected by coastal- ﬂ ow. 
  Zone      3  :   Coscinodiscus      nodulifer   ––  Thalassiothrix    
  longissoma  ––  Roperia      tesselata   ––  Coscinodiscus    
  radiatus   (Xisha area) 
 Zone 3 was highly enriched with diatoms with 
abundance range of 24 482–196 244 valve/g and average of 83 606 valve/g. The abundance tended to increase with increasing water depth. For example, in deeper stations (SA12-29, SA13-48, and SA13-53), the abundance was around 100 000 valve/g, while in shallow ones, it was around ~5 000 valve/g. Zone 3 was rich in a diverse assemblage of diatoms, with 32 comprising >1%. The dominant species,  C .  nodulifer  , 
accounted for 28.8%–47.1%; thermophilic  R .  tesselata   1.4%–7.8%; and warm-water species 
 C .  radiatus   2.7%–8.3%. Furthermore, warm-water 
species  T .    paciﬁ c  a  accounts for 0.6%–6.6%; 
thermophilic  H .  cuneiformis  ,  C .  africanu   s , and 
 N .  marin   a  for 1.3%–13%, 0%–5.6%, and 0%–3.6%, 
respectively; eurythermal species  T .  nitzschioides   for 0.4%–2.5%.  
 Along with a decrease of the eurythermal and 
coastal species, thermophilic and warm-water species increased signi ﬁ cantly in the zone 3, indicating the 
effect of northern currents in the southwestern region of the SCS, and the water mass invasion from the southern region of the SCS. Zone 3 is in a bathyal environment with transitional water masses and covers the Xisha area with an extension to the southeastern region of the Hainan Island at water depth 800–1 800 m. The substrate was clayey silt. 
  Zone 4   :   Coscinodiscus      nodulifer   ––  Roperia    
  tesselata   ––  Thalassiothrix      longissoma   (sea basin) 
 The maximum, minimum, and average abundances 
in this zone were 623 438, 4792, and 197 239 valve/g, respectively. The number of diatom species was large, with 42 species having content greater than 1%. Thermophilic species were dominant, of which  C .  nodulifer   and  R .  tesselata   accounted for 26.3%–
49.4% and 3%–8.2%, respectively. Eurythermal species  T .  longissima   accounted for 0.2%–11.8%. In 
addition, thermophilic  C .  africanus  ,  H .  cuneiformis  , 
and  N .  marin   a  accounted for 0%–4.3%, 0.7%–4% 
and 0.3%–4%, respectively; warm-water species  C .  radiatus   and  T .  paciﬁ c  a  accounted for 0%–6.4% 
and 1.7%–5%, respectively; eurythermal  T .  
e  x  centrica   
accounted for 1.7%–6.4%; and eurythermal and coastal species  M .  sulcata  ,  A  ctinocyclus    ehrenbergii  , 
 C .    striata  , and  C .  stylorum   accounted for 0.6%–11%, 
0.8%–5.3%, 0.9%–5% and 0%–7.1%, respectively.  
 The diatom assemblages in this zone indicate the 
inﬂ uences of warm currents. Zone 4 is in bathyal to 
abyssal environment, with stable and uniform central water masses. Depth is generally greater than 2 000 m, except for stations east of the Indochinese Peninsula and Station NS2007-204 (9°51.34 ′E, 115°36.05 ′N) at 
1 446 m deep. Overall, Zone 4 is deeper in the eastern waters and shallower in the western. The deepest station was at 4 238 m. The substrate types are complex. In the abyssal plain, grain size was ﬁ ne and 
the sediment was clay silt; in the islands southeast of the Nansha Islands, the sediment was silt.  
  Zone 5   :     Coscinodiscus      nodulifer  –– Thalassiosira    
  excentrica  –– Roperia      tesselata   (Nansha Islands area) 
 Diatom abundance was high, with maximum, 
minimum, and average values of 377 778, 35 148, and 210 000 valve/g, respectively. Thermophilic species were dominant, with the most abundant being  C .  nodulifer   (16.3%–50.6%). Abundances ranged 
between 3%–13.4% for eurythermal  T .  e  x  centrica   
and 3%–9.8% for thermophilic  R .    tesselata  . Other 42 CHIN. J. OCEANOL. LIMNOL., 31(1), 2013 V ol.31
species in Zone 5 included: thermophilic  C .  africanus   
(1.4%–8.1%),  H .    cuneiformis   (0.6%–4.6%), and 
 N .  marin   a  (0.5%–3.5%); warm-water species 
 T .  paciﬁ c  a  (1.5%–6%),  C .  radiatus  , and  T .  sackettii   
(0.8%–3.9%); eurythermal  T .  longissima   (0%–8.6%) 
and  T .  n  itzschioides   (0%–4.6%); eurythermal-coastal 
species  M .  sulcata   (0.8%–8.4%) and  C .  stylorum   
(0.4%–5.8%). The high diatom abundance suggested nutrient input into the SCS. These could be surface inputs by rivers in the islands of Kalimantan, by the Sulu waters running through the Balabac Strait, or by upwelling of intermediate and deep-water masses driven by southwest monsoon. Zone 5 is a warmer pelagic zone covering the Nansha Islands at water depths of 1 071–2 589 m. Substrate was clayey silt. 
  Zone 6   :   Coscinodiscus      nodulifer   ––  Melosira    
  sulcata   ––  Cyclotella      stylorum   (Northern Sunda 
Shelf) 
 Overall, diatom abundance was low; the highest, 
lowest, and average levels were 2 578, 79, and 879 valve/g, respectively. Thermophilic  C .  nodulifer  , 
as a dominant species, accounted for 4.6%–62.5% of the total assemblage, whereas eurythermal-coastal species  M .  sulcata   and  C .  stylorum   accounted for 9% 
and 5%, respectively. Other species included warm-water species  H .  cuneiformis   (0.5%–3.1%) and 
 R .  tesselata   (0%–10.9%) and eurythermal species 
 T .  simonsenii   (0%–7%) and  
D .  brightwellii   (0%–
9.4%).  
 In Zone 6, tropical and subtropical pelagic species 
diminished, while coastal species increased, which was signi ﬁ cantly different from other zones and 
indicates the in ﬂ uence of the coastal ﬂ ow. Zone 6 is in 
a tropical shelf environment and is distributed in the northern Sunda Shelf southwest of the SCS, at water depths 100–400 m. Zone 6 is largely affected by geographical and meteorological factors, due to its shallow nature; an example is the mixture of diluted coastal water masses from the Mekong River (whose estuary is located northwest of this zone) and the water masses from the open sea. 
  Zone 7   :   Coscinodiscus      nodulifer  ––  Trachyneis    
  antillarum   ––  Hemidiscus      cuneiform   s  i  (north of 
Kalimantan Island Shelf areas) 
 Zone 7 had 24 diatom species accounting for over 
1% abundance. Tropical oceanic and coastal species were dominant, the most abundant being thermophilic  C .  nodulifer   (12.5%–36.4%). Brackish species 
 T .  antillarum   accounted for 1%–27.3%, and 
thermophilic  H .  cuneiformis   accounted for 5.9%–
18.2%. Other species included eurythermal  T .  simonsenii   (0%–12.5%), warm-water species 
 C .  radiatus   (0%–25%), eurythermal-coastal  P  odosira   
 stelliger   and  C  ampylodiscus    ralfsii   (0%–9.1%) and 
thermophilic  N .  marin   a  (0%–11.8%).  Concentricystes   
spp. was detected at all stations of Zone 7. Zone 7 is located north of the Kalimantan insular outer shelf at water depths of 62–114 m with silty sand substrate. It featured the lowest diatom abundance of the study area, with an average of 291 valve/g (range 71 to 1 094 valve/g). This diatom assemblage represented an environment affected by warm waters from Indian Ocean and coastal waters. The presence of  Concentricystes   spp. shows that Zone 7 is affected by 
freshwater from the Rajang River and the Balaam River in Kalimantan Island. 
 5 DISCUSSION 
 As shown above, the diatom distribution in the 
SCS is affected by various marine environmental conditions. However, previous studies on the relationship between diatom distribution and ambient conditions have yielded very different conclusions. Wang et al. (1988) believed that diatom assemblages in surface sediments in the northern SCS are related closely to temperature, salinity, depth and currents etc. Zhan (1987) demonstrated a close relationship between diatom quantity and environmental factors such as landforms and ocean currents, and also the source of material and sediment velocity etc. Liu et al. (1984) believed that the number and types of sedimentary diatoms are affected by factors such as geology, geomorphology, hydrodynamics, temperature, salinity, and nutrients. We believe that the main factors in this case are seabed topography, hydrodynamics, temperature, salinity, and nutrients. 
 5.1 Seabed topography 
 The results show that the distribution of diatom 
abundance is closely related to depth and topography. Station SA09-089 (4°46.27 ′N, 111°16.58 ′E) in the 
Sunda Shelf, yielded the lowest regional value of diatom abundance at 71 valve/g only, while Station YSJD18 (11°39.58 ′N, 113°2.77 ′E) in a 3 700 m basin 
produced the highest one at 623 438 valve/g. Moreover, Zone 7 in the southernmost part of the study area, or the northern periphery of the Kalimantan Island shelf featured the lowest average abundance of 291 valve/g. In Zone 6 (in the southwestern shallow area of the Sunda Shelf) and Zone 1 (in the northern continental shelf) the average abundances were 352 43 No.1   WU et al.  :   Diatom assemblages in surface sediments from the SCS as environmental indicators    
and 907 valve/g, respectively. 
 In the external shelf and slope (Zone 2) in the 
northwest of the study area, the average abundance was 3 124 valve/g. In the slopes of the southeast region of the Hainan Island and Xisha Islands waters (Zone 3) in water depth of 500–1 800 m, the distribution was patchy: about 100 000 valve/g at deeper stations and about 5 000 valve/g at shallower stations. In the Nansha Islands (Zone 5), a bathyal area ranging from 1 071 to 2 589 m in depth, average diatom abundance was very high at 210 000 valve/g.  
 The ﬂ at abyssal plains of the Nansha basin (Zone 
4) are in the center of modern sedimentation in the SCS. The Nansha Island Basin, in particular, was rich with various diatoms at average abundance of 197 239 valve/g. Although some stations, including SA14-24, were located at the deposition center of the basin, no high abundance was found there due to the input of volcanic materials from adjacent volcanic eruptions. The areas around seamounts that are distributed east-west in the central basin and the Nansha Islands are characterized by complicated seabed topography, varying water depth, and varying diatom abundance. 
 5.2 Effects of hydrodynamics 
 Tiny diatom cells are easily carried out by currents 
and barely stored in the sediment. For example, in Station NS2007-34, in the shelf areas of the Mekong estuary, sand content was 100% and no diatoms were found. This may explain why diatom valves were found in ﬁ ner sediments with grain sizes <60 μm 
(Chen, 2005), indicating that sandy sediments are unfavorable for diatom preservation. Under strong hydrodynamic conditions, diatom valves could be carried for a great distance and hardly deposited. Moreover, sediments could be scoured somewhat. For example, currents passing through the vicinity of the Sunda Shelf are often strong and most valves could be moved away with the currents. Sediments left in-situ after scouring would be coarse particles, and only a few valves would be deposited. Low clay content found at Stations SA09-43 (1.44%), SA09-46 (4.97%) and SA09-89 (9.01%) indicates strong hydrodynamics. 
 The sea basin is conducive to sediment 
accumulation because it is located in a low-lying area where currents, particularly bottom currents, are slow. The area of the Xisha Islands is also conducive to deposition. In the southern waters of Xisha Islands, a strong southwesterly forms due to the winter monsoon, but it weakens as it is blocked by islands in the western part of the study area. A counterclockwise 
circulation is formed with the con ﬂ uence of the 
southward currents in the northern gulf. Therefore, diatom content becomes higher in this area, as seen at Station SA13-48. In addition, the Nansha Islands have distinct circulation characteristics controlled by the prevailing monsoon. During the northeastern monsoon period, the western part of the study area would experience a basin-wide cyclonic circulation, whereas in the southeastern part, an anti-cyclonic circulation may form. During the southwestern monsoon period, on the other hand, the upper circulation around the Nansha Islands is controlled by an anti-cyclonic circulation, resulting in upwelling in a horizontal scale of approximately 400 km (Su, 2005). The concentration of diatoms in this area was the highest of the region, with an average of 210 000 valve/g. 
 5.3 Effects of hydrological and climatic conditions 
 The number and variety of diatom species in 
sediment are affected not only by geological geomorphology and hydrodynamics but also by temperature, salinity, and nutrients (Liu et al., 1984). The SCS is typical of tropical and subtropical marine climates. Local hydrological data show that the annual average temperature is 22.6°C in the most northern area of the SCS and 28.5°C in the most southern area, warming progressively southwards. In comparison with the division of sedimentary diatoms by Jousé et al. (1971) in the Paci ﬁ c Ocean, the diatoms in the 
SCS could be divided into northern species, subtropical species, tropical species, and equatorial species with thermophilic properties. In the SCS, the northern species include  T .  longissima   and 
 C .  s  tylorum  ; subtropical species include  C .  radiatus  , 
 T .  nitzschioides  ,  Pseu   do  e  unotia    doliolus     (Wall.) 
Grunow, and  R .  tesselata  ; tropical species include 
 C .  crenulatus  ,  C .  nodulifer  ,  H .  cuneiformis  , 
 T .  oestrupii  ,  R .  bergonii  , and  N .  m  a  rina  and equatorial 
species include  C .  africanus  ,  Asteromphalus   
 imbricatus     Wallich,  Triceratium    
cinnamomeum   
Greville, and  Asterolampra    marylandica  . These 
species are main varieties seen throughout the SCS, and follow the trends of atmospheric and water temperatures, changing with latitude. 
 Salinity is one of the most important factors 
affecting diatom distribution, because different taxa adapt differently to salinity. Accordingly, diatoms have been divided into freshwater, brackish, and marine classes (Wang, 1985). The distribution of 44 CHIN. J. OCEANOL. LIMNOL., 31(1), 2013 V ol.31
diatoms in the SCS is consistent with salinity 
variation. Surface-water salinity is signi ﬁ cantly 
different between coastal and offshore areas. Generally, the salinity in coastal areas is low (30 to 33) and varies with seasonal changes, whereas that in offshore waters outside the coastal area is high (>34), making them uninhabitable for some freshwater species. Few freshwater diatoms, such as  Cymbella   
 aspera   (Ehr.) Cleve, were found in the northern 
continental shelf waters (Zone 1). The amount of  Concentricystes   spp. found in the northern Kalimantan 
Island shelf area (Zone 7) was also low: these species can only enter the sea from rivers. Coastal currents affect Zones 1, 2, and 6, so the proportions of coastal oligohalabous species, such as  M .  sulcata   and 
 C .  stylorum  , were higher. Conversely, euryhaline 
planktonic diatoms were the dominant species in the deep-sea areas of Zones 3–5. 
 5.4 Effects of other factors 
 Deposition rate also affects the number and variety 
of diatoms (Liu et al., 1984). For example, the deep-sea clay that deposits in the central basin of the SCS, which exceeds 4 000 m in depth, is similar to oceanic red clay. The deposition rate of the deep-sea clay is 3 cm per Ma or so, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of oceanic red clay (Wang, 1995). Jousé et al. (1971) reported that the lowest diatom abundance in Paci ﬁ c Ocean surface sediments was 4 
million valve/g and that the highest could reach hundreds of millions. The highest abundance recorded in the SCS was only 623 438 valve/g. This large difference is due to the higher deposition rate in the SCS compared with the Paci ﬁ c Ocean. 
 In summary, seabed topography, hydrodynamics, 
temperature, salinity mainly, and nutrients affect the number and variety of diatoms in sediments of the SCS. Their combined effects determine the distribution of diatoms. 
 6 CONCLUSION 
 (1) Most ﬁ ne-grained surface sediments in the SCS 
contained a large number of diatoms, with much fewer diatoms in coarse sediments. Diatom abundance varied greatly in space. The average diatom abundance was 104 607 valve/g over the whole area. Diatom abundance tended to increase from shelf to basin. 
 (2) The SCS is rich with diatom species. In total, 
256 species and varieties from 56 genera were identi ﬁ ed in the present study. The 10 most dominant species are  C .  africanus  ,  C .  nodulifer  ,  C .  stylorum  , 
 H .  cuneiformis  ,  M .  sulcata  ,  N .  marina  ,  R .  tesselata  , 
 T .  nitzschioides  ,  T .  e  x  centrica  , and  T .  longissima  . 
 (3) Diatom assemblage zonation re ﬂ ects different 
oceanographic conditions at a regional scale: Zone 1 (northern continental shelf) represents an environment affected by warm currents, SCS northern branch of the Kuroshio Current and northern coastal currents; Zone 2 (northwestern continental shelf) is affected by intense coastal currents; Zone 3 (Xisha area) is a bathyal environment with transitional water masses; Zone 4 (sea basin) is a bathyal-to-deep sea environment with stable and uniform central water masses belonging to a semi-enclosed marginal sea; Zone 5 (Nansha Islands area) is a pelagic environment with higher surface temperature; Zone 6 (Northern Sunda Shelf) is a tropical shelf environment; and Zone 7 (northern Kalimantan Island shelf area) is affected by warm waters from the Indian Ocean and coastal waters. These zones could be of great importance in future paleoceanographic studies. 
 (4) The main factors that affect the distribution of 
sedimentary diatoms are seabed topography, hydrodynamics, temperature, salinity, and nutrients.
