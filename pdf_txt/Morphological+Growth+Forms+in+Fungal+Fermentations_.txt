The effect of spore inoculum level and mycelia morp hology on raw starch digesting amylase production 
by Aspergillus carbonarius  in submerged culture was investigated. Shake flask  cultures were 
inoculated directly with spore concentration range of 10 4 to 10 9spores/ml. Morphology was 
differentiated into, pellets, clumps, branched and free filaments. Results on the percentage 
morphologyical occurrences revealed that for all te sted inoculum a gradual change in morphology was 
observed as innoculum level increased from 10 4 to 10 9spores/ml though pellets predominated. A 
decrease in the mean main and total hyphal length, mean hyphal growth unit and marginal increase in 
mean number of tips/mycelium was observed in the my celia trees as inoculum levels increased from 
10 4 to 10 9spores/ml. In the aggregated forms, there was a dec rease in the mean area, perimeter, 
roughness and equivalent diameter while mean compac tness increased as inoculum increased from 10 4 
to 10 9 spores/ml. Irrespective of the predominating form a change in morphology was observed. RSDA 
production appeared to be related to spore inoculum  level. Maximum yield was observed at 
fermentation inoculated with 10 4 and 10 5spores/ml where pellets were most dominant. The imp act of 
spore inoculum size on the resulting mycelia morpho logy was marginal but had a significant effect on 
RSDA production. 
 
Key words:  Aspergillus carbonarius , raw starch digesting amylase, fungal morphology a nd inoculum.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
When grown in submerged culture, fungi exhibit dive rse 
morphological forms, ranging from dispersed mycelia  
filaments to densely interwoven mycelia masses refe rred 
to as pellet (Papagianni and Mattery, 2006; Papagia nni, 
2004) The particular form exhibited is determined n ot 
only by the genetic material of the fungal species but also 
the nature of the inoculum, medium constituents, as  well 
as the culturing conditions (Kossen, 2000). There a re 
cases, where control of mycelia morphology was 
considered a prerequisite for successful metabolite  
production. In some processes a particular morpholo gical 
form  may be  preferred  to  achieve  maximal  prod uction

Tel: 234 81 341 890 69.  (Znidarsic et al., 2000; Van Suidjam et al., 1980; Steel et 
al., 1954). Filamentous growth of Aspergillus niger for 
instance is preferred for pectic enzyme production,  while 
the pelleted form gives optimal yield during citric  acid 
production (Steel et al., 1954; Kristensen and Bull uck, 
1988; Gomez et al., 1988). Inoculum quality (size, shape 
and type) and morphology affects filamentous 
fermentation. Van Suijdam et al. (1980) reported th at A. 
niger pellets  would only form at inoculum sizes below 10 8 
spores/ml, while according to Calam (1987), Penicillium 
chrysogenum  forms pellets at inoculums sizes below 
10 4spores/ml, but at higher inoculums levels, disperse d 
growth prevails (Braun and Vecht-Lifshitz, 1991). S tudies 
on the two extreme morphological forms (pellets and  free 
filaments) have shown that, a morphological form ma y 
account for the bulk of the biomass like the case o f P. 
chrysodenum where  clump  morphology  accounted  for  90%     
 
 
 
of the biomass (Parker and Thomas, 1990; Tucker et al., 
1992). Papagianni and Mattey (2006) observed a clea r 
transition from pellets to dispersed morphological forms 
in citric acid fermentation by A. niger  at inoculum 
concentration range of 10 4 to 10 9spores/ml, with pellets 
constituting at least 95% of biomass at 10 4spores/ml 
inoculum level, while clumps constituted 90% at ino culum 
levels at 10 6 and 10 7spores/ml. 
The application of image analysis since the 1990s h as 
enabled the extraction of quantified information in  the 
detailed characterisation of various morphological forms. 
Tucker and Thomas (1992) described quantitatively t he 
transition from pelleted to disperse forms of growt h of P.  
chrysogenum  as inoculum level rose towards 10 5 
spores/ml of medium. Papagianni and Mattey (2006); 
Pamboukian et al. (2002); Papagianni and Mooyoung 
(2001) have used the same method to study the 
characterisation of A. niger  and Streptomyces olindensis  
in submerged fermentations. Different software’s ar e now 
available for the characterisation of morphological  forms, 
Nair et al. (2011) applied fluorescent indicators t o analyse 
intracellular calcium and morphology in the filamen tous 
fungi P. chrysogenum . The applicability of using Ca 2+  
sensitive dye to quantify [Ca 2+ ] in P. chrysogenum  
cultures and concurrent application of dye-loaded h yphae 
for morphological analysis using the imaging softwa re 
filament tracer (Bitplane) was investigated. Essent ial 
quantitative mycelia information including the leng th and 
diameter of the segments and the number of branch 
points were obtained using their application based on the 
three dimensional data. In the study of Ruhl and Ku es 
(2009), an image analysis system for fungal pellets  was 
developed using the commercial software system 
analysis and the protocol was evaluated in morpholo gical 
studies of pellet formation in submerged cultures o f 
basidiomycete coprinopsis cinerea. 
Several important morphological studies have been 
carried out with filamentous fungi and streptomyces , in 
organic acid and enzyme production, but there has n ot 
been any work on raw starch digesting amylase 
fermentation and Aspergillus carbonarius . The aim of this 
investigation was to observe the trend in morpholog y as 
well as the effect of changing spore inoculum level  on the 
resulting mycelia morphology of A. carbonarius  in 
submerged cultures for raw starch digesting amylase  
production. Also we tried to characterise and quant ify the 
mycelia morphology. The Moticam 1000 digital 
microscope camera (motic image plus software) was 
used for studies on morphology of the fungus. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Microorganisms, inoculum and media preparations  
 
A. carbonarius  var (Brainer) Thom IMI 366159 (University 
of Nigeria, Nsukka) was used throughout this work. The 
organism was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PD A)   Onyetugo and Barthlomew         1935 
 
 
 
slants subcultured every 3 months.  A. carbonarius  
maintained on PDA slants was transferred to fresh P DA 
plates and incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Spores wer e 
collected from mature culture plates and spore 
suspensions were diluted with sterile medium to mak e a 
range of concentrations in the order of 10 4 to 10 9 spores 
/ml of media. 
The fermentation medium comprised (gL-1): Raw 
cassava starch ( Manihot utilissima  Crantz), 20; yeast 
extract, 5; KH 2PO 4, 7; CaCl 2.6H 2O, 0.3; and 
MgSO 4.7H 2O, 0.3 in distilled water and autoclaved at 
121°C for 15 min at 15 psi. 
 
 
Culture conditions (shake flask cultures) 
 
The microorganism produced aerial spores. Inoculum 
preparation was by means of washing 3 plates of den se 
growth with 10 ml of fermentation medium and 
transferring the spores and mycelium aseptically in to 250 
mL flask, the spore content was approximately 
10 11 spores /ml.  Five hundred millilitre (500 mL) flask  
containing 100 ml fermentation medium was inoculate d 
with spores in the concentration range of 10 4 to 10 9 
spores/ml. Fermentation was carried out with rotary  
shaking at 100 rpm and 30°C for 144 h. 
 
 
Amylase activity assay 
 
Raw starch digesting amylase activity was assayed u sing 
reaction mixture containing 0.5 ml of 1% (w/v) of r aw 
starch in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 0. 5 ml of 
crude enzyme solution and 0.1 ml toluene incubated at 
40°C for 10 min. Reducing sugars released after 
incubation were estimated by DNS method of Miller 
(1959). One unit of the amylase activity was define d as 
the amount of enzyme that produced reducing sugar 
equivalent to 1 µmol of glucose from raw starch per  min 
under the assay conditions. 
 
 
Image analysis and processing 
 
Image capture was carried out via a semiautomatic 
image analyser Moticam 1000 digital microscope came ra 
UK, (Motic Images plus 2.0 ML) with a USB 2.0 cable . 
Mounted on a microscope (Optika, Italy) connected t o a 
PC.  
Samples for morphological characterization were tak en 
at 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 h and subsequently at 24 h i nterval 
for 144 h. Samples were immediately fixed with an e qual 
volume of fixative as described by Parker and Thoma s 
(1990), 13 ml of 40% w/v formaldehyde and 5 ml glac ial 
acetic acid added to 200 ml of 50% w/v ethanol. The  
fixed samples were further diluted with fixative an d 
dilution was adjusted to separate the mycelia clump s on 
the microscope slide. Images were captured at 640 to  512  1936          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res.

pixals. A magnification of 40× and 100× was applied  for 
measurements on mycelia particles. 
Segmentation was performed to obtain a binary image ; 
measurements were carried out on binary images and by 
adjustment of greyness levels. A filter was applied  to the 
segmentation to show the ends and branching points and 
the total length was measured. Medium particles 
artefacts, debris and morphological particles which  were 
touching the organism and could have biased the res ults 
were removed by filter and in some cases computer 
aided manual measurement was applied to measure and  
subtract false images. 
Mycelial morphology was classified into unbranched,  
branched, entangled or clumped and pelleted. The 
morphological parameters measured were, mean main 
and total hyphal length, number of tips and hyphal growth 
unit (total length divided by number of growing tip s) for 
the dispersed form.  For the analysis of clumps/pel lets 
the area, perimeter, compactness, roughness and 
diameter were measured. The roughness is given by t he 
circularity factor using the equation (p2/4 πA) and 
compactness was estimated by the ratio of the area of 
the hyphae in the clump/pellet to the total area en closed 
by its actual outer perimeter (Tucker et al., 1992) . 
Percentage morphology was determined by mycelia 
count.  
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The development of Aspergillus carbonarius  
morphology 
 
Figure 1 shows different classes of morphology of A. 
carbonarius in submerged cultures. Results indicated that 
spores appeared swollen at 4 h of fermentation and a good number of them were agglomerated. It was 
observed that at 6 h period, germination had starte d with 
branched hyphae, while at 12 h branching was very 
apparent and permanent aggregates were detected. By  
inoculating directly with spores we were able to ob serve 
the period of spore swelling, germination and branc hing. 
At 24 h, a morphological trend was established as t hey 
were in either pellets or free filamentous form dep ending 
on the spore inoculum level. Results obtained in th is 
study are consistent with the observation of Papagi anni 
and Mattey (2006), with respect to citric acid ferm entation 
by A. niger .  
As illustrated in Figures 2 to 7 varying the spore 
inoculum level resulted in different mycelia morpho logy at 
the end of growth phase in the batch culture. All l evels of 
tested inocula were plotted against morphological 
parameters corresponding to dispersed or aggregated  
morphological form. For all the tested inocula pell ets 
dominated but different morphological form were 
identified. 
Figure 2 shows percentage morphology occurrence at 
72 h for various inoculum levels. Data obtained rev ealed 
various morphological forms with pellets dominating  in all 
the range of inocula evaluated. With 10 4 and 10 5 spore/ml 
inoculum level, pellets accounted for 95 and 90%. 
Inoculum levels of 10 6 and10 7 spores/ml gave a mixture 
of pellets, clumps and dispersed mycelium with pell et 
dominating at 75 and 65%, respectively, clumps at 1 5 
and 20% and dispersed at 10 and 15% respectively. 
Inoculation with 10 8 and 10 9 spores/ml revealed pellets to 
account for 50% of detected objects while the clump s and 
dispersed were 30 and 20% respectively. Tucker et a l. 
(1992) in testing a method for fully automatic imag e 
analysis of mycelia morphology reported that over 9 0% of 
the batch culture consisted of clumped morphologica l 
forms. Papagianni and Mattey (2006) reported  pelle ts  to  a  b  c d

account for 95 and 90% of mycelia growth with inocu lum 
levels of 10 4 and 10 5 spores/ml, while clumps and 
dispersed morphology dominated in inoculum levels o f 
10 6 to 10 9spores/ml.There was no sharp transition from 
pellet to dispersed in the present investigation, a s 
reported by Papagianni and Mattey (2006) and Tucker  et 
al. (1992) who studied the effect of inoculum level  with 
spore inoculum range of 10 4 to 10 9 and 5 × 10 4 to 5 × 
10 5spores/ml, respectively, but rather the presence of  all morphological forms was observed in all the tested 
inoculum levels. However looking beyond the 
predominating form one can say that there was a gra dual 
change from pelleted to disperse morphology. It is 
therefore possible that the agitation intensity inf luenced 
the rate of pellet formation in the case of the pre sent 
study.

deduced from the result that there was a decrease i n the 
mean hyphal growth unit, and an increase in mean 
number of tips/mycelium as inoculum level increased  
from 10 4 to 10 9 spores/ml. There was a marked decrease 
in both the mean main hyphal length and mean total 
hyphal length of mycelium as inoculum level increas ed 
from 10 4 to 10 9 spores/ml. The results of this study 
showed that the impact of the spore inoculum level on the detailed characteristics of a particular morphologi cal form 
was marginal. Results of the mean number of 
tips/myceliium could be attributed to low agitation  
intensity (100 rpm), where there is little or no br eakage of 
the mycelia particle. There are several reports whi ch 
suggest that hyphae are shorter, thicker, and more highly 
branched at high agitation speed compared to low sp eed

10 9spores/ml, may be attributed to the presence of mix ed 
morphological objects (a mixture of pellets, clumps  and 
dispersed morphology) resulting from higher inoculu m 
levels. According to the results of Papagianni and Mattey 
(2006), Nielson et al., (1995), and Tucker and Thom as 
(1992) higher spore concentration yielded clumped a nd 
dispersed morphology. 
Figures 5 and 6 show the effect of spore inoculum 
levels on mycelia aggregation; The results depict t hat 
there was a marked decrease in mean area and mean 
perimeter of clumps and pellets as inoculum levels 
increased from 10 4 to 10 9 spores/ml, while their 
roughness decreased and compactness increased as 
inoculum levels increased from 10 4 to 10 9 spores/ml. This 
is consistent with Tucker and Thomas (1992) for P. 
chrysogenum  and Papagianni and Mattey (2006) for A. 
niger . They reported a large decrease in clump and pelle t 
sizes and marked changes in compactness and 
roughness when inoculum levels were increased from 5x 
10 4 to 5 × 10 5spores/ml and 10 4 to 10 9spores/ml, 
respectively. 
Figure 7 shows mean equivalent diameter of pellets at 
72 h of fermentation of spores inoculated with spor e 
inocula ranging from 10 4 to10 9 spores/ml. It revealed that 
mean equivalent diameter of pellets decreased as 
inoculum level increased from 10 4 to 10 9spores/ml. Since 
pellets dominated in all levels of inoculums, the m ean 
equivalent diameter (the diameter of a circle of th e same 
area as the measured feature) of approximately 25 
pellets was measured per sample and the variation 
reported as percentage error. Smaller sized pellets  resulted from the 10 8 to 10 9 spores/ml inoculum level, 
while larger pellets where observed in the lower in oculum 
of 10 4 to 10 5 spore/ml. The result of the decrease in pellet 
diameter differed with the report of Nielson et al.  (1995) 
who found pellet diameter increasing with spore 
concentration in P. chrysogenum. They attributed the 
result to physical contact between hyphal elements at 
higher spore concentrations. However our report is in 
agreement with Papagianni and Mattey (2006), who 
observed that agglomeration leading to pellet forma tion, 
is determined by both the organism and the 
environmental conditions. 
Figure 8 shows the results of RSDA production by A. 
carbonarius  with spore inocula ranging from 10 4 to 
10 9spores/ml.  The results revealed formation and 
release of RSDA to be related to spore inoculum lev el. At 
24 h in higher inoculum level (10 8 and 10 9spores/ml) 
RSDA was formed. The optimum yield of 306 and 297 
U/ml was noticed at 48 h in fermentation inoculated  with 
10 8 and 10 9spore/ml. At inoculum levels of 10 4 and 10 5, a 
gradual increase in yield was observed with an opti mal 
yield of 403 and 432 U/ml at 96 h of fermentation a nd a 
sharp drop by the end of the fermentation. Inoculat ing 
with 10 6 and 10 7spores/ml let to a gradual increase in 
RSDA with an optimum yield of 301 and 286 U/ml at 7 2 h 
of fermentation.

us to classify and to a reasonable extent quantify the 
effect of spore inoculum level on fungal morphology . We 
were able to identify all morphological forms in al l tested 
inocula and besides the dominating morphological fo rm 
and low agitation intensity there was a change from  pellet 
to dispersed morphology as inoculum increased from 10 4 
to 10 9spores/ml. The impact of spore inoculum level on 
the characteristics of each particular morphologica l form 
produced by changing the concentration of spores wa s

spore inoculum level influenced mycelia morphology and 
RSDA production.
