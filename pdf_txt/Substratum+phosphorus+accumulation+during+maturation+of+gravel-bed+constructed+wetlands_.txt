Abstract  
 
This study investigated the efficiency of two types of media, namely, 
gravels and sand for their nutrient removal capabilities from 
wastewater. Different levels of sa nd depths were also experimented for 
their removal efficiencies. And for this purpose three laboratory scale 
vertical upflow constructed wetlands (S1, S2, S3) were established at 
PHE Laboratory, MNIT, Jaipur. S1was filled with two layers of 
different size of gravels while S2 and S3 also contained different 
depths of sand along with the layers of gravels. All the lab scale CWs 
were fed with the second ary treated water brought from sewage 
treatment plant , Jaipur. The study was carried out for a period of thre e 
months from February to April, 2013. The results show that sand 
provides better removal of nutrients from wastewater than gravels, 
though TKN removal was better with gravels. Both sand and gravel 
were unable to remove NO 3-N from the system as there was an 
increase in NO 3-N in the system. But overall it can be concluded that 
sand provided more efficient treatment than gravels.

1. Introduction  
Constructed wetlands (CWs) are human made basin based on various engineering 
design. They provide ecological condition same as natural wetlands for treating 
wastewater in different physical, chemical and biological conditions  (Sayadi, et al. 
2012) . High quality effluent water is crucial for reducing the damage caused by 
releasing treated wastewater into different water bodies. Also, the quality of the treated 
wastewater is important to the state like Rajasthan, India that has limited water 
resources and use treated wastewater for irrigation. Due to the dwindling supply of 
fresh water, Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), India has provided some 
standards for nutrient removal from wastewater.

Vegetation in wetland plays an important role in CW but size and surface nature of 
the media also provides additional sites for adsorption of nutrients and biofilms 
development. A major factor in the performance of constructed treatment wetlands is 
the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate. Hydraulic retention  time of the wetland 
system is dependent on the hydraulic conductivity. Thus, maintenance of hydraulic 
conductivity is must (Sundaravadivel M. 2003) . The main parameter influencing the 
soil hydraulics is the grain -size distribu tion (Stottmeister, et al. 2003) . Wetland 
systems with fine - and soil - based substrates will have low hydraulic conductivity, 
while coarse sand - and gravel - based medium display higher conductivity 
(Sundaravadivel M., 2003).  Experience in Germany and long -term studies of the 
hydraulics of constructed wetlands with different soil parameters indicate that a 
mixture of sand and gravel produces the best results in terms of both hydraulic 
conditions and the removal of contaminants (Stottmeister, et al. 2003) . 
Plant uptake, substrate adsorption and ammonia volatilization are the type of 
nitrogen removal mechanism but are generally of less importance. Biological 
nitrification –denitrification is usually th e most significant nitrogen removal Comparison of Different Types of Media for Nutrient Removal Efficiency  407 
 mechanism in CWs. (Fenxia Ye 2009) . But plants provide environment in the root 
zone for nitrification -denitrification to occur (Reddy K.R. 1997) . The main P -remo val 
mechanisms are adsorption on media and precipitation reactions. Biological 
assimilation and plant uptake has a very little role in phosphorus removal. Since 
harvesting plants contributes very little to phosphorus removal from CW, therefore 
media play a  major role in phosphorus removal (Dong Cheol Seo 2005) . In sand or 
gravel substrates, phosphorus is bound to the media mainly as a consequence of 
adsorption and precipitation reactions with Ca, Al and Fe. At pH levels greater than 6, 
the reactions are a combination of physical adsorption to iron and aluminium oxides 
and precipitation as sparingly soluble calcium phosphates. At lower pH levels, 
precipitation as iron and aluminium phosphates (strengite, variscite) becomes 
increas ingly important. The capacity of filter media to remove P may therefore be 
dependent on the contents of these minerals in the substrate  (Vohla Christina 2011) . 
In the gravel systems, (Tanner 1999)  showed P accumulation decreased and 
substratum P -sorption capacity became saturated in 5 years. (Korkusuz 2005)  showed 
for domestic wastewater treatment in Turkey, vertical subsurface flow constructed 
wetlands showed TP removal  efficiency for gravel wetland cells of only 4%. (He 
2007)  reported TP removal during a 14 -weeks experiment in a gravel wetland from 
6.8% to 54%, on average 22.44%. In pilot -scale units containing medium gravel 
obtained from a quarry, (Akratos 2007)  found greater removal efficiency for  fine 
gravel (89%), followed by medium gravel with cattail (67%) and cobbles (57%). The 
removal efficiencies of the other two units were significantly lower (medium gravel 
with reed 28.2%; medium gravel alone 43.9%). PO 4 3− and TP removal efficiency was 
predominantly affected by porous media size and type. (Arias 2001)  found that the P -
removal capacity of some sands would be used up after only a few months in full -scale 
systems, whereas that of others would persist up to several  years. The most important 
characteristic of the sands that determined their P -removal capacity was their Ca 
content. (Pant 2001)  showed that some local sands from Canada with elevated contents 
of Fe, Al and Ca have high P sorp tion capacity. Sand filters are also known as efficient 
units for complex wastewater purification (BOD, COD, NH4 -N, and also in some 
cases PO 4-P and fecal coliforms).  
Many of the studies concentrated on selection of bed media based on their sorption 
capaci ty. But, every plant and media combination may have different treatment 
potential. In order to extract maximum treatment potential, plant and media 
combination is critical. However, not much of the research work has been done on this 
point. The following p oints reveal the areas where the research is lacking.  
 Compatibility of medium materials with the growth of specific plant species 
has not been studied to much extent.  
 Also, the combined effect of media size and specific wetland species on 
nutrient removal  has not been studied extensively.  
 Comparative data among different plant and media combinations under similar 
conditions is still sparse.  Priya et al

The purpose this study was to investigate the nutrient removal efficiency of two 
types of media namely, sand and gra vels. The specific objectives were: 1) To examine 
and compare the efficacy of sand and gravels for N, P, K removal, 2) To identify and 
compare the different depths of sand medium for better N,P,K removal, 3) To examine 
and compare the NH 4-N and NO 3-N remov al at two different heights of the vertical 
upflow constructed wetlands and 4)To examine other parameter like pH, alkalinity and 
COD.  
 
 
2. Material & Methods  
The study was performed on three vertical up -flow constructed wetlands (namely S1, 
S2, S3) located outside the PHE Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, MNIT, 
Jaipur. The experimental analysis was carried out at PHE Lab, MNIT, Jaipur and 
Agricultural Research Lab, Durgapura, Jaipur for a period of three months from 
February to April, 2013. All th e reactors were fed with secondary treated wastewater 
obtained from STP, Jaipur.  
The experimental set up was comprised of three trapezoidal plastic tank of volume 
20 L each; provided with three outlets. The dimensions were 0.70 m length and width 
at inlet,  middle outlet and final outlet was 0.254m, 0.279m and 0.305m respectively. 
The total area of each reactor was 0.176m2. The three opening for inlet, middle and 
final outlet are at the depth of 0.635m, 0.3556m, and 0.5842m respectively. Each 
system was fitt ed with a broad crested weir at the bottom which was meant to equally 
distribute wastewater. The treatment zone depth in each system was 0.5842m. The 
flow rate was maintained at 8.64L/day with the help of peristaltic pump. The reactor 
S3 was established on  31st December, 2012 while rest  two were established a year 
ago.

The samples were taken twice a week and were immediately analyzed for NH 4-N, 
NO 3-N, TKN, PO 4, potassium, pH and alkalinity.  (APHA, Standard Methods for the 
Examination of Water and Wastewater 1999) . 
 
 
3. Results  
3.1 NH 4-N Results (At Final Outlet)  
The removal efficiency of S1, S2 and S3 was 58.41%, 68.91% and 64.14% 
respectively. The fine grained soils always show better nitrogen removal through 
adsorption than the coarse -grained soil. The higher elimination rate can be explained 
by th e higher cation exchange capacity of the fine grained soils (J. Vymazal 2005) . 
This explains the removal efficiency of S1, S2 and S3 because S1 contained gravels 
while S2 and S3 contained gravels along with sand. Although S3contained larger depth 
of sand than S 2 but provided less treatment. This difference in treatment of S2 and S3 
can be due the fact S3 is newly established system. It might take some time to get 
stabilized though the treatment is almost the same as S2. Thi s somewhat less treatment 
might be due to the fact the microbial layer was not properly developed in it and the 
roots of the plant might not have extended deep enough. From the graph (1), it can also 
be seen that in the last week of analysis S3’s removal e fficiency had increased. So, it 
can be inferred that the system had been stabilized in four months. According to MoEF 
standards, NH 3-N of maximum 50 mg/L is allowed for inland surface water disposal. 
The effluents from all the three wetland systems were be low the MoEF standards so 
they can be disposed off into inland water and can be used for irrigation as well.

3.2 NO 3-N Results  (At F inal Outlet )  
The average NO 3-N influent was 6.25 mg/L and the average NO 3-N effluent of S1, S2 
and S3 was 32.70 mg/L, 42.96 mg/L and 17.06 mg/L. The percent increase in nitrate 
S1, S2 and S3 was 80.88%, 85.45% and 63.37% respectively. The increment in NO 3-N 
in S2 as compared to S1 can b e explained by fact that S2 provided more sites for 
ammonium adsorption than S1. So when these ammonium ions came in contact with 
oxygen, they got oxidized to NH 4-N. Sand also decreases the hydraulic conductivity of 
the wastewater so increases the time for  treatment. Now, when S2 and S3 were 
compared the result contradicted with the expected result. The depth of the sand 0102030405060

 medium in S3 was larger as compared to S2, so it was obvious that it provided more 
adsorption sites for ammonium ions and more time for tr eatment. But, the fact that S3 
was newly established, the root growth and microbial layer might take some more time 
to make the system work efficiently. According to MoEF standards, NO 3-N of 
maximum 10 mg/L is allowed for inland surface water disposal. The  effluents from all 
the three systems had higher concentration of nitrate nitrogen than recommended by 
MoEF so effluent wastewater from them cannot be disposed off into inland waters but 
can be used for irrigation.  
 
3.3 Middle Outlet NH 4-N Results  
The exp erimental analysis for middle outlet effluent was done for 6 days only. With 6 
days data it was observed that the removal efficiency at middle outlet of S1, S2, and S3 
was 18.14%, 4.54% and 4.57% respectively at middle outlet and 33.17%, 40.57% and 
73.20% respectively at the final outlet. S1 was filled with a thick layer of one type of 
gravel  only while both S2 and S3 were filled with two l ayers of different gravel sizes . 
This configuration was up to the middle outlet. The results were somewhat 
contradictin g in the sense that as the size of the gravel decreases, the NH 4-N removal 
should increase because the surface area for adsorption increases. But the possible 
explanation of the present result can be the larger pore size of the gravels in S1 which 
provided  better and uniform colonization of microorganisms and more oxygenation. 
The results of S2and S3 are same since they have same configuration till middle 
outlets. The results of S2 and S3 at the final outlet showed better removal because of 
the presence of sand above the middle outlet in both the system. Presence of sand 
reduced the hydraulic conductivity and increased the duration for adsorption of NH 4 
ions in S2 and S3 hence provided better removal. Presence of plants near the final 
outlet is also one of the beneficial factors.  
 
3.4 Middle Outlet NO 3-N Results  
The percent NH 4-N removal of S1, S2 and S3 was 18.14%, 4.54% and 4.57% 
respectively at middle outlet. And the percent NO 3-N removal of S2 and S3 was 
27.81% and 13.23% while there was 29.98% increase in NO 3-N in S1. These results 
clearly show that S1 is very well aerated because NH 4-N got oxidized to NO 3-N and a 
good amount of nitrification occurred in the system. Contrast to this, in S2 and S3, 
NO 3-N removal occurred which shows that both the systems are less oxygenated in 
comparison to S1. S1 comprised of a layer of 16 -20mm gravels while S2 and S3 were 
filled two different layers of gravels till the middle. And this could be the possible 
reason of less oxygen in S2 and S3. S1 had larger and uniform po res so better oxygen 
transfer occurred in it. S2 provided better nitrate nitrogen removal than S3 though they 
both had the same configuration till the middle point. This is because microbial film in 
S2 is well developed than S3 as S3 was only four months o ld system.

3.5 Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen ( TKN ) Results  
The removal efficiency of S1, S2, and S3 are 51.75%, 43.42% and 41.55% 
respectively. The average influent TKN was 76.14 mg/L and average effluent TKN of 
S1, S2 and S3 were 36.37 mg/L, 42.80 mg/L and  44.60 mg/L respectively. These 
results show that TKN removal greatly depends on the porosity of the media. As the 
porosity of media increases, the oxygen transfer across the media increases and hence 
TKN removal also increases. Gravels provide better adhe ration sites for microbial 
layer than sands which provided better mineralization of organic nitrogen and 
oxidation of ammonium ions. According to MoEF standards, TKN of maximum 100 
mg/L is allowed for inland surface water disposal. The effluents from all t he three 
wetland systems were below the MoEF standards so they can be disposed off into 
inland water and can be used for irrigation as well.

 3.6 Phosphorus (as orthophosphate) Results  
The removal efficiency of S1, S2and S3 is 41.10%, 70.80% and 83.93% respectively. 
The average influent phosphorus was 9.64 mg/L and the average effluent phosphorus 
of S1, S2 and S3 was 5.68 mg/L, 2.81 mg/L and 1.55 mg/L respectively . It is well 
known that fine grained soil has better phosphorus removal abilities as they have 
greater surface area to provide better adsorption. The results of the present study very 
well relate to this theory. S1 had only gravel medium while S2 and S3 ha d gravel 
medium as well as sand medium. Thus, increase in the thickness of the sand layer had 
proved beneficial for the phosphorus removal. According to MoEF standards, 
dissolved phosphates of maximum 5 mg/L is allowed for inland surface water disposal 
and the effluents from only S2 and S3 wetland systems were below the MoEF 
standards so they can be for inland water disposal and for irrigation as well. The 
effluent from S1 can only be used for land for irrigation.  
 
3.7 Potassium results  
It is noteworthy tha t in the literature, there is not much information on potassium 
removal in wetlands with which to compare the findings of this study. Potassium is an 
essential element in both plant and human nutrition, and occurs in ground waters as a 
result of mineral di ssolution, from decomposing plant material, and from agricultural 
runoff. The common aqueous species is K+. Unlike sodium, it does not remain in 
solution, but is assimilated by plants and is incorporated into a number of clay -mineral 
structures. It is one of the macro nutrients for plant growth. The removal efficiency of 
S1, S2 and S3 were 38.19%, 64.24% and 82.94% respectively. From these results it 
can be explained that potassium removal occurred both due to plant uptake and 
adsorption to the media. S2 an d S3 had more adsorption sites than S1. One more thing 
that can be inferred from these results is that increasing the depth of sand medium gave 
almost the same amount of removal although the concentration of potassium in 
influent had increased.

3.8 COD  
The organic matter in wastewater are degraded both anaerobically and aerobically by 
heterotrophic microorganisms in the wetland reactors depending on oxygen 
concentration in the bed (Soon -An Ong 2009) . The total removal efficie ncy of S1, S2 
and S3 is 40.88%, 48.56% and 36.38% respectively. The average influent COD was 
166.9 mg/L and the average effluent COD of S1, S2 and S3 was 98.66 mg/L, 85.85 
mg/L, 106.18 mg/L respectively.  The difference in COD removal efficiency of S1 and 
S2 is due to presence of gravel and sand medium in the system. Filtration, which is an 
important process in the removal of COD imparting wastewater constituents, is 
effected well by sand. Sand can even remove such small materials as pathogenic 
bacteria in w ater. This is the reason the S2 provided better COD removal. S3 provided 
the least COD removal because this system is new as compared to others. The possible 
reason of less treatment is that microbial layer in the system is not fully developed. 
According t o MoEF standards, COD of maximum 250 mg/L is allowed for inland 
surface water disposal. The effluents from all the three wetland systems were below 
the MoEF standards so they can be disposed off into inland water and can be used for 
irrigation as well.  
 
3.9 Alkalinity and pH Results  
The average influent pH and alkalinity was 8.5225 and 474.4. The average effluent pH 
of S1, S2 and S3 was 8.417, 8.491 and 8.492 respectively and the average effluent 
alkalinity of S1, S2 and S3 was 576.53, 451.46 and 502.13 res pectively. As it can be 
seen that pH of the effluent has not decreased much and there is an increase in the 
alkalinity in almost all the three systems. The increase in the alkalinity in S3 and S2 
can be contributed to simultaneous nitrification and denitri fication in the system. In S1, 
nitrification is the major process but microbial layer respiration adds CO 2 in the water 
which forms bicarbonate ions and in turn increases the alkalinity. Calcium generally is 
the prevailing metal in the natural sands and hi gh pH of domestic sewage, favor 0100200300400

 precipitation reactions with Ca in the medium. The pH of the effluent between 7.5 and 
8.5 favors the chemical precipitation of the various forms of calcium phosphates 
(Vohla Christina 2011) . This  also indicates that precipitation reactions with Ca were 
one of the processes responsible for the removal of phosphorus in the sands studied.  
The precipitation reactions could lead to increasing pH but increase in alkalinity acts as 
buffering agent and ma intains a stable pH of the wastewater.  
 
 
4. Conclusion  
This study showed that sand in the system did not provide better oxygenation 
throughout the system, while gravels did. But, it did provide better adsorption sites for 
ammonium, phosphate and potassium ions. It also proved good for filtration of organic 
matter. Calcium ion dissolution from sand helped in better phosphorus removal. 
However, gravels provide better adheration sites for microbial layer. Plantation helped 
in better oxygenation of the system b ut it did not allow nitrogen removal from the 
system. Increase in nitrate in planted vertical upflow constructed wetland leaves the 
wastewater unhealthy for inland surface disposal as it would cause eutrophication. But 
this water can be used for irrigation  and would decrease cost of fertilizers. Use of 
locally available sand increased the phosphorus removal and would also decrease the 
cost of medium when applied in full scale constructed wetlands.
