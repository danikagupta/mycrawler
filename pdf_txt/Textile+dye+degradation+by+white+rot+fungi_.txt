Abstract 
 In this study one azo dye “Congo red”, two triphenymethane dyes “Crystal violet” and “Methylene blue” have been 
selected for biodegradation using three soil fungal isolates A. niger, F . oxysporum and T. lignorum. These fungal strains 
were isolated from field soil. Three methods were selected for biodegradation, viz. agar overlay and liquid media methods; 
stationary and shaking conditions at 25°C. The experiment was conducted for 10 days and the results were periodically observed. Aspergillus niger decolorized maximum Congo red (74.07%) followed by Crystal violet (33.82%) and Methylene  
blue (22.44%) under liquid medium (stationary) condition. Whereas, under same conditions, T. lignorum decolorized maximum  
crystal violet (92.7%), Methylene blue (48.3%) and Congo red (35.25%). Use of T. lignorum as dye bio degrader or decolorizer  
has been done first time in this study. Fusarium oxysporum performed better under shaking conditions compared to stationary  
and overlay method. It can be concluded that among soil fungus T. lignorum could be used as efficient dye decolorizer 
especially for crystal violet and A. niger for Congo red. The excellent performance of T. lignorum and F . oxysporum in 
the biodegradation of textile dyes of different chemical structures reinforces the potential of these fungi for environmental decontamination similar to white rot fungi.

1. Introduction Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, 
a lot of chemicals including dyes are manufactured 
and are being used in day-to-day life. About 100,000 commercial dyes are manufactured including several varieties of dyes such as acidic, basic, reactive, azo, diazo, anthraquinone based meta complex dyes with an annual production of over 7×10
5 metric tons are 
commercially available (Campos et al., 2001). Approxi -
mately 50% of the dyes are released in the industrial effluents (Zollinger, 1991). They are used on several substrates in food, cosmetics, paper, plastic and textile industries. Some of them are dangerous to living organ-isms due to their possible toxicity and carcinogenicity. Dyes in wastewater often lead to instance; the incidence of bladder tumors has been reported to be particularly higher in dye industry workers than in the general population (Suryavathi et al., 2005). Natural pigments 
used for coloring textiles have been replaced by “fast colors” which do not fade on exposure to light, heat and water. These features unfortunately go with the perils of harmful effluent quality. About 15 % of the dyes used for textile dying are released into processing waters (Eichlerova et al., 2006). Besides being unaesthetic, 
these effluents are mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic (Chung et al ., 1992).
 Following are the names of common dyes 
other than used in this study, which are carcinogenic in nature; Benzidine, 2-Aminoanthraquinone, o-

Abstract
The aim of the present study was to standardize and to assess the predictive value of the cytogenetic analysis
by Micronucleus (MN) test in fish erythrocytes as a biomarker for marine environmental contamination. Micronucleus
frequency baseline in erythrocytes was evaluated in and genotoxic potential of a common chemical was determinedin fish experimentally exposed in aquarium under controlled conditions. Fish ( Therapon jaruba ) were exposed for 96
hrs to a single heavy metal (mercuric chloride). Chromosomal damage was determined as micronuclei frequency infish erythrocytes. Significant increase in MN frequency was observed in erythrocytes of fish exposed to mercuricchloride. Concentration of 0.25 ppm induced the highest MN frequency (2.95 micronucleated cells/1000 cells comparedto 1 MNcell/1000 cells in control animals). The study revealed that micronucleus test, as an index of cumulativeexposure, appears to be a sensitive model to evaluate genotoxic compounds in fish under controlled conditions.

1. Introduction
In India, about 200 tons of mercury and its
compounds are introduced into the environment
annually as effluents from industries (Saffi, 1981).Mercuric chloride has been used in agriculture as afungicide, in medicine as a topical antiseptic anddisinfectant, and in chemistry as an intermediate in
the production of other mercury compounds. The
contamination of aquatic ecosystems by heavymetals and pesticides has gained increasing attentionin recent decades. Chronic exposure to andaccumulation of these chemicals in aquatic biotacan result in tissue burdens that produce adverseeffects not only in the directly exposed organisms,but also in human beings.
Fish provides a suitable model for monitoring
aquatic genotoxicity and wastewater qualitybecause of its ability to metabolize xenobiotics andaccumulated pollutants. A micronucleus assay hasbeen used successfully in several species (De Flora,et al ., 1993, Al-Sabti and Metcalfe, 1995). The
micronucleus (MN) test has been developedtogether with DNA-unwinding assays asperspective methods for mass monitoring ofclastogenicity and genotoxicity in fish and mussels(Dailianis et al.,  2003).
The MN tests have been successfully used as
a measure of genotoxic stress in fish, under bothlaboratory and field conditions. In 2006 Soumendra
et al., made an attempt to detect genetic biomarkers
in two fish species, Labeo bata andOreochromis
mossambica, by MN and binucleate (BN)
erythrocytes in the gill and kidney erythrocytes
exposed to thermal power plant discharge atTitagarh Thermal Power Plant, Kolkata, India.
The present study was conducted to determine
the acute genotoxicity of the heavy metal compoundHgCl
2 in static systems. Mercuric chloride is toxic,
solvable in water hence it can penetrate the aquaticanimals. Mutagenic studies with native fish speciesrepresent an important effort in determining thepotential effects of toxic agents. This study wascarried out to evaluate the use of the micronucleustest (MN) for the estimation of aquatic pollutionusing marine edible fish under lab conditions.

The fish species selected for the present study
was collected from Pudhumadam coast of Gulf of
Mannar, Southeast Coast of India. Therapon
jarbua  belongs to the order Perciformes of the
family Theraponidae. The fish species, Therapon
jarbua (6-6.3 cm in length and 4-4.25 g in weight)

EnvironmentAsia 6(2) (2013) 51-5752processes involving various combinations of biological, 
physical and chemical decolorization methods (Galindo and Kalt, 1999; Robinson et al., 2001; Azbar et al., 
2004), of these, approximately 10 – 15 % of unused dyes enter the wastewater after dyeing and after the subse-quent washing processes (Rajamohan and Karthikeyan, 2006). Chemical and physical methods for treatment of dye wastewater are not widely applied to textile industries because of exorbitant costs and disposal problems. Green technologies to deal with this problem include adsorption of dyestuffs on bacterial and fungal biomass (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2002; Yang et al., 2009) 
or low-cost non-conventional adsorbents (Crini, 2006; Ferrero, 2007).  A variety of physicochemical treatments have been 
devised previously for the dyes and textile wastewater. However, these suffered from some serious drawbacks in terms of their limited applications or their high cost. Besides, chemical treatments created an additional chemical load in water bodies that eventually resulted in sludge disposal problems. Several factors determine the technical and economic feasibility of each single dye removal technique. These include; dye type and its concentration, wastewater composition, operation costs (energy and material), environmental fate and handling costs of generated waste products. A very small amount of dye in water (10-50 mg/L) is highly visible and reduces light penetration in water systems, thus causing a negative effect on photosynthesis (Cooper, 1993; Vandevivere et al., 1998). 
 Recently, dye removal became a research area 
of increasing interest, as government legislation  
concerning the release of contaminated effluent  
becomes more stringent. Various treatment methods for removal of dyes from industrial effluents like chemical coagulation using alum, lime, ferric chloride, ferric  
sulphate and electro coagulation are very time  
consuming and costly with low efficiency. Among the numerous water treatment technologies, research  
interest in the fungal bioremediation due to their  
biomass compared to the bacteria, has increased  
significantly for decolorization and degradation of synthetic dyes. Common bacteria used for bioremedia -
tion were mainly species of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, 
Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Escherichia , while the common fungal strains are 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleuroteus ostreatus, Piptoporus betulinus, Funalia trogii, Coriolus  
versicolor, Cyathus stariatus and sp. of Fusarium, 
Aspergillus (Azmi et al., 1998). Keeping the above points in view, the main  
objectives of the problem was to screen and employ selected potential soil fungal sp. capable to decolorize 
and biodegrade the textile dyes using solid and liquid 
media under shaking and stationary conditions.

 The soil-derived fungal strains were obtained from 
the culture collection of College of Applied Education & 
Health Sciences, Meerut, India. All three strains Asper -
gillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma 
lignorum were isolated from fields of Meerut region, North India and maintained on Potato Dextrose Agar (Himedia, Mumbai, India) and sub cultured periodi -
cally to maintain their viability. Identification of these soil fungal strains was done previously based on their morphological characters (Yao et al., 2009). These soil 
fungi have selected in present study because A. niger 
and F . oxysporum has been widely studied for dye 
decolorization, while the potential of T. lignorum has 
been exploited first time. 
2.3. Screening of soil-derived fungi for dye decoloriza-
tion activities
 Fifty six field soil fungal strains were screened 
for their ability to degrade dyes using the tube overlay 
method. Initially, the fungal strains were grown on culture plates pre-filled with Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at room temperature for 14 days. Following incubation, mycelial agar plugs (~5 mm
2) 
were cut approximately 5 mm from the colony margin and inoculated on test tubes (in triplicates) containing 5 ml of PDA overlaid with 1 ml of PDA with 0.01% (w/v) respective textile dye. All culture tubes were incubated at room temperature (~25
oC) and observed 
weekly for up to four weeks. Clearing of the overlaid dye indicates full decolorization (+++). Partial dye decolorization (++) was indicated by less dye intensity in comparison with the control (uninoculated PDA overlaid with PDA + 0.01% dye). All the three fungal strains were selected on the basis of full or maximum (+++) decolorization.
2.4. Decolorization of dyes in solid medium (Tube 
overlay method)
 The three selected soil isolated fungal strains were 
further tested for their ability to decolorize on PDA and 
Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) medium, Himedia, Mumbai, India. This was done to select which medium support better growth and dye decolorization activities of selected fungal isolates. Initially, all the three fungal strains were grown as previously described. Following incubation, fungal mycelial agar plugs (~5 mm
2) were 
cut approximately 5 mm from the colony margin and inoculated on test tubes (in triplicates) each pre-filled with 2 ml of the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium, supplemented separately with either with following dye 0.01 % (w/v) crystal violet, methelyene blue and Congo 
red, respectively (Lopez et al., 2006). The culture tubes 
were then incubated at room temperature (~ 25
oC). The 
growth of the fungi and its ability to decolorize the dye 
were observed weekly up to four weeks. The depth of dye decolorization (in mm) indicated by clearing of the dye was then measured.
2.5. Assay for the dye decolorization activities of fungi 
in liquid media  
 The spores and mycelia were then dislodged using 
a flame-sterilized inoculating loop. Then, 10 μl of the inoculum were added on culture vials (in triplicates) pre-filled with 25 ml Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) supplemented with 0.01% of either one of the following dyes: Congo red, methylene blue, and crystal violet. Three sets were prepared and were incubated either under constant agitation/shaking (100 rpm, Yorko Scientific Orbital Shaker) or under stationary/without shaking condition (Park et al., 2007). All culture vials 
were incubated at room temperature (~25°C) for 10 days and all assays were performed in triplicate. Growth and dye decolorization were noted every day. Following culture for 10 days, the culture filtrates were decanted and subjected to spectrophotometric analysis. For the crystal violet, the absorbance reading was done at 590 nm wavelength. Congo red and methylene blue were read at 497 nm. The extent of dye decolorization by the soil fungal strains on liquid media was calculated using the formula below:
Percent dye decolorization (%)  =  
 Finally, the mycelial biomass were harvested on 
clean Petri plates and observed directly. Fungal hyphae 
were also mounted on clean glass slides and observed under a compound light microscope for the biosorption of dyes.
2.6. Enzyme assay Laccase activity was measured by using syrin-
galdazine as a substrate as per the method of (Valmaseda 
et al., 1991). The activity was assayed using using 1.0 ml of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.7) and 0.2 ml syringaldazine (1.6 mg/ml) in absoluted ethanol, (4.47 Mm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of syringaldazine and after mixing; incubations were conducted at 30°C for 1h, because after 1h highest enzyme laccase activity was observed. The absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer (ELICO SL 150) Absorbance control –Absorbance inoculated ×100                  Absorbance controlA.Shahid et al. / EnvironmentAsia 6(2) (2013) 51-5754before (0 time) and after incubation (60 min) at 526 
nm and the increase in absorbance was calculated. One unit activity was defined as the enzyme producing one absorption unit/min at 526 nm.
3. Results Out of 56 fungal isolates, three soil fungal isolates 
selected after comprehensive screening of the textile 
dyes biodegradation for further studies. In tube overlay method, F . oxysposrum decolorized maximum (36.7%) 
Congo red followed by A. niger (34.21%) and T. ligno-
rum (19.73%), while the highest percentage of crystal violet (55.26%) was degraded T. lignorum, 28.1% by 
F . oxysporum and 23.68% by A. niger, respectively. 
Similar trend was also observed in methylene blue biodegradation, (21.5%) by T. lignorum, (14.9%) by F . 
oxysporum and (13.15%) by A. niger (Fig. 1). The depth 
of decolorization of textile dyes by tested soil fungal isolated using tube overlay method exhibited the trend of Fig. 1. The range of depth of decolorization ranged from 7.5 to 13 mm in Congo red, 9 to 21 mm in crystal violet and 5 to 8 mm in case of methylene blue (Fig.2).   Under stationary conditions, biodegradation of 
Congo red was maximum (78.9%) by F . oxysporum, 
followed by A. niger (74.07%) and least by T. lignorum 
(35.25%). In case of crystal violet T. lignorum biode-
graded (92.7%) followed by F . oxysporum (53.4%) 
and A. niger (33.82%), respectively. The trend was 
reversed in case of methylene blue, where T. lignorum 
and F . oxysporum biodegraded equally i.e. 48.3% 
and 48.5% respectively, while A. niger showed least 
biodegradation activity i.e. 22.44% (Fig. 3). Under constant shaking conditions the over all dye biodegra -
dation was better compared to stationary state. Congo red was biodegraded almost equally by the three test fungal isolates, ranged from 84.7-91.4% decolorization.  
Highest percentage of crystal violet was biodegraded by T. lignorum (96.6%), followed by A. niger (78.8%) and 
F . oxysporum (56.1%), similar trend was followed in case of mythylene blue, where highest biodgrdation was by T. lignorum (85.2%) and least was by F . oxysporum 
(53.4%) (Fig. 4). The laccase activity was also measured of all the test fungi and the three exhibited positive test, which showed that this enzyme also plays a role in biodegradation of textile dyes. Figure 1. Dye decolorization by soil fungi in tube overlay method

The trend was reversed in case of methylene blue, where T. lignorum  and F. oxysporum biodegraded 
equally i.e. 48.3% and 48.5% respectively, while A. niger  showed least biodegradation activity i.e. 
22.44% (Fig. 3). Under constant shaking conditions the over all dye biodegradation was better compared 
to stationary state. Congo red was biodegraded almost equally by the three test fungal isolates, ranged 
from 84.7-91.4% decolorization. Highest percentage of crystal violet was biodegraded by T. lignorum  
(96.6%), followed by A. niger  (78.8%) and F. oxysporum  (56.1%), similar trend was followed in case of 
mythylene blue, where highest biodgrdation was by T. lignorum  (85.2%) and least was by F. oxysporum  
(53.4%) (Fig. 4). The laccase activity was also measured of all the test fungi and the three exhibited 
positive test, which showed that this enzyme also plays a role in biodegradation of textile dyes.  
 
 
 
Figure 3. Dye decolorization by soil fungi in liquid media under stationary conditions A.Shahid et al. / EnvironmentAsia 6(2) (2013) 51-57554. Discussion
 The use of these soil fungi, thus could offer a much 
cheaper and efficient alternative treatment of wastewa-
ters contaminated heavily with textile dyes. However, 
even though qualitative assays using the tube overlay 
method are powerful tools in screening fungi for extra -
cellular enzyme production, they are not conclusive in that a negative reaction is not an absolute confirmation of a species’ inability to produce a particular enzyme (Abdel-Raheem and Shearer, 2002). Hence, the tube agar overlay method (Lopez et al., 2006) only provides 
an easier and quicker method to screen a large number of fungal isolates for further studying dye decoloriza -
tion activity. The removal of the dye color is vital in the potential 
ap¬plication of soil fungal organisms as bioremediation agents in wastewater treatment plants and in runoff waters. Thus, it is essential to test soil fungal strains for dye decolorization in liquid medium. In the present study, soil fungus Aspergillus niger decolorized maxi -
mum Congo red (74.07%) followed by Crystal violet (33.82%) and Methylene blue (22.44%) under liquid medium, stationary condition. Whereas, under the same conditions, T. lignorum decolorized maximum Crystal 
violet (92.7%), Methylene blue (48.3%) and Congo red (35.25%). Fusarium oxysporum also exhibited 
encouraging results under shaking conditions with 
decolorization of Congo red was 78.9%, Crystal violet 
53.4%, while the Methylene blue was 48.5%. Ollikka et al. (1993) reported that Congo red was a substrate for the ligninolytic enzyme lignin peroxidase.  Use of T. lignorum as dye bio degrader or decolor -
izer has been studied first time in this report and the efficient decolorization may be attributed to either through the action of extracellular enzymes such as  
laccase and/or biosorption by the fungal biomass. Lac -
case production by the soil fungal species have been studied, this test was performed to know, whether laccase enzyme plays any role in biodegradation of dyes. Tatarko and Bumpus (1997) confirmed that Congo red was readily degraded in liquid cultures as also shown in this study. Furthermore, the soil fungal strains also showed promising decolorization activities against crystal violet (Figs. 3-4). Results of the dye

22.44% (Fig. 3). Under constant shaking conditions the over all dye biodegradation was better compared 
to stationary state. Congo red was biodegraded almost equally by the three test fungal isolates, ranged 
from 84.7-91.4% decolorization. Highest percentage of crystal violet was biodegraded by T. lignorum  
(96.6%), followed by A. niger  (78.8%) and F. oxysporum  (56.1%), similar trend was followed in case of 
mythylene blue, where highest biodgrdation was by T. lignorum  (85.2%) and least was by F. oxysporum  
(53.4%) (Fig. 4). The laccase activity was also measured of all the test fungi and the three exhibited 
positive test, which showed that this enzyme also plays a role in biodegradation of textile dyes.

4. Discussion 
The use of these soil fungi, thus could offer a much cheaper and efficient alternative treatment of 
wastewaters contaminated heavily with textile dyes. However, even though qualitative assays using the 
tube overlay method are powerful tools in screening fungi for extracellular enzyme production, they are 
not conclusive in that a negative reaction is not an absolute confirmation of a species’ inability to produce 
a particular enzyme (Abdel-Raheem and Shearer, 2002). Hence, the tube agar overlay method (Lopez et 
al., 2006) only provides an easier and quicker method to screen a large number of fungal isolates for 
further studying dye decolorization activity. 
The removal of the dye color is vital in the potential application of soil fungal organisms as 
bioremediation agents in wastewater treatment plants and in runoff waters. Thus, it is essential to test soil 
fungal strains for dye decolorization in liquid medium. In the present study, soil fungus Aspergillus niger  
decolorized maximum Congo red (74.07%) followed by Crystal violet (33.82%) and Methylene blue 
(22.44%) under liquid medium, stationary condition. Whereas, under the same conditions, T. lignorum  
decolorized maximum Crystal violet (92.7%), Methylene blue (48.3%) and Congo red (35.25%). 
Fusarium oxysporum  also exhibited encouraging results under shaking conditions with decolorization of 
Congo red was 78.9%, Crystal violet 53.4%, while the Methylene blue was 48.5%. Ollikka et al. (1993) 
reported that Congo red was a substrate for the ligninolytic enzyme lignin peroxidase.  
Use of T. lignorum  as dye bio degrader or decolorizer has been studied first time in this report 
and the efficient decolorization may be attributed to  either through the action of extracellular enzymes 
such as laccase and/or biosorption by the fungal biomass. Laccase production by the soil fungal species have been studied, this test was performed to know, whether laccase enzyme plays any role in 
biodegradation of dyes. Tatarko and Bumpus (1997) confirmed that Congo red was readily degraded in liquid cultures as also shown in this study. Furthermore, the soil fungal strains also showed promising 
decolorization activities against crystal violet (Figs. 3-4). Results of the dye biodegradation by soil fungi 
in this study using spectrophotometric analysis were even comparable with the percent dye decolorization 
exhibited by the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus (Yao et al., 2009), and 
even Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Bumpus and Brock, 1988).   A.Shahid et al. / EnvironmentAsia 6(2) (2013) 51-5756spectrophotometric analysis were even comparable 
with the percent dye decolorization exhibited by the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus 
ostreatus (Yao et al., 2009), and even Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium (Bumpus and Brock, 1988).   Soil fungi possess ligninolytic enzymes and play 
an important role in the degradation of lignocellulose in soil ecosystems (Okino et al., 2000). These lignin-
degrading enzymes are directly involved not only in the degradation of lignin in their natural lignocellulosic  
substrates but also in the degradation of various xenobi-otic compounds, including dyes. Moreover, ligninolytic enzymes have been reported to oxidize many recalcitrant substances such as chlorophenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus compounds, and phenols (Wesenberg et al ., 2003). 
 Biosorption of dyes occur essentially either through 
complexation, adsorption by physical forces, precipita -
tion, entrapment in inner spaces of fungal mycelium, ion exchange due to surface ionization, and by formation of hydrogen bonds (Yeddou-Mezenner, 2010). Due to an increased cell-to-surface ratio, fungi have a greater physical contact with the environment. Thus, some fungi have demonstrated better dye adsorption potential exceeding that of activated charcoal (Fu and Viraragha-van, 2002). Additionally, it is not unusual for some spe -
cies to demonstrate both enzyme-mediated degradation and biosorption in the decolorization of textile dyes (Park et al., 2007). It is thus feasible that in addition to 
the production of extracellular enzymes, the ability of the soil fungi to decolorize synthetic dyes is coupled also with their biosorption abilities (Kaushik and Malik, 2009). We have also observed dye absorption by the test fungal mycelium under light microscope (1500 ×). This may account for the more efficient Congo red and crystal violet biodegradation by the soil fungal strains (Kirby et al., 2000) (Figs.1-4). It is therefore, possible 
that the ability of soil-derived fungi to degrade crystal violet, methylene blue and Congo red as revealed in this study can be largely attributed to the lignin-degrading enzyme system of the organism. In addition to extracel-lular enzymes, it is also likely that dye decolorization activity of these fungi could also be attributed to the ability of their mycelia to adsorb/absorb the dye.  
5. Conclusions We have studied the decolorization of dyes under 
stationary and shaking conditions; we have got encour -
aging results after 5 days, but maximum decolorization 
of all the dyes were obtained after 10 days. In this study we have observed higher decolorization under shaking conditions, which could be due to better oxygenation of the fungus and regular contact of secreted enzymes with dye molecules to decolorize it, moreover agitation also helps the fungus to grow better. Disappearance of dye color may be due to biodegradation of chromophore in dye molecule because of extracelluar enzyme produc-tion by fungi. Due to the environmental friendly tech -
niques it utilizes, bioremediation has been characterized as a soft technology. Its cost-effectiveness and the little disturbance in the environment render this technology a very attractive and alternative. The identification and research of new fungal strains with the aid of molecular techniques will further improve practical application of fungi and it is anticipated that fungal remediation will be soon a reliable and competitive dye remediation technology.
