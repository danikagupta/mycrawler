Abstract A considerable increase in nitrate concentration
in groundwater has been observed in many countries. This
research focuses on nitrate removal using biodegradablesnack ware (BSW) as both carbon source and bioﬁlm
support for denitriﬁers. The denitriﬁcation efﬁciency of a
laboratory-scale denitriﬁcation reactor packed with BSWwas examined in a low-temperature condition. The nitrate
removal efﬁciency supported by BSW decreased to
approximately 40% at 12 /C176C from nearly 100% at 25 /C176C
with 50 mg/L of nitrate-nitrogen in the inﬂuent and 2 h of
hydraulic retention time (HRT). The complete nitrate
removal was obtained when nitrate-nitrogen concentrationwas no more than 15 mg/L at 2 h of HRT and at 12 /C176C. If
the initial concentration of nitrate-nitrogen was 50 mg/L,
5 h of HRT was needed for the complete nitrate removal.Nitrite concentration in the treated water decreased evi-
dently as HRT was increased from 2 to 5 h, or as nitrate-
nitrogen concentration in the inﬂuent decreased to 15 mg/Lfrom 50 mg/L. It was observed that varying HRT and
nitrate concentration in the inﬂuent had no noticeable effect
on dissolved organic carbon content in the efﬂuent under
the experimental conditions. This study indicated that the
complete nitrate removal could be achieved readily even at12/C176C using BSW as carbon source by changing HRT or the
initial concentration of nitrate in the inﬂuent, which hassome useful implications in environmental engineering
practice.

Introduction
Groundwater is one of main water sources for human
consumption in most countries of the world. In somecountries, especially those located in droughty area,
groundwater is used as the only water resource, such as
Saudi Arabia (Alabdula’aly 1997 ). In China, more than
50% of population uses groundwater as drinking water (Jin
et al. 2004 ). Recently, a considerable increase in nitrate
concentration in groundwater has been observed in manycountries including China (Ovez 2006 ; Rocca et al. 2007 ;
Sierra-Alvarez et al. 2007 ; Wang and Wang 2009 ). Con-
cern over nitrate contamination is due to health problemsrelated to methemoglobinemia in infants (blue baby syn-
drome) and cancer of the alimentary canal and there is no
other group of carcinogens that can produce such a wide
variety of tumors by consuming nitrate-contaminated
water (Vosoughifar et al. 2005 ; Wang and Wang 2009 ).
Nitrate pollution of groundwater is caused mostly by
intensive use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture
and uncontrolled land discharges of raw and treatedwastewater (Shrimali and Singh 2001 ; Mahvi et al. 2005 ;
Ghafari et al. 2008 ).
In comparison to physical and chemical methods (such
as reverse osmosis, ion exchange and electrodialysis) to
remove nitrate from groundwater, biological denitriﬁcation
stands out for being the most economical and feasible on alarge scale, as well as for being the only selective method

DOI 10.1007/s13762-011-0004-8for removing nitrate by transforming it into harmless
nitrogen gas (Volokita et al. 1996 ; Moreno et al. 2005 ;
Bidhendi et al. 2006 ). The majority of microbial denitriﬁ-
cation treatment relies on heterotrophic bacteria whichrequire an organic carbon source.
Groundwater has low carbon content; therefore,
external carbon-containing substrates have to be added.Usually, dissolved carbon source such as ethanol, meth-
anol or acetate is used as electron donors for nitrate
reduction (Bandpi et al. 1999 ). The disadvantage of this
treatment process is the need of a close, rather sophisti-
cated process control, and has the risk of overdosing withthe resultant deterioration of efﬂuent water quality (Boley
et al. 2000 ). To avoid above-mentioned problems, insol-
uble substrates (solid carbon sources) including wheatstraw, cotton, polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyhydrox-
yalkanoates (PHAs) as an alternative to the liquid carbon
sources have been successfully employed in denitriﬁca-tion process by some researchers in recent years (Soares
and Abeliovich 1998 ; Boley et al. 2003 ; Hiraishi and
Khan 2003 ; Wang and Wang 2009 ). Solid substrates used
in the denitriﬁcation process serve as both constant
sources of reducing power for denitriﬁcation and matrices
favorable for development of microbial ﬁlms (Hiraishiand Khan 2003 ).
Most of the denitriﬁcation processes are carried out
under mesophilic conditions. However, in some regions inthe northern countries, groundwater temperatures (from 10
to15/C176C) are below the mesophilic range (Kim et al. 2002 ;
Nakajima-Kambe et al. 2005 ). As a result, the investigation
on psychrophilic denitriﬁcation process could be useful in
optimizing the design and operation of such treatment in
low-temperature regions. As far as it is known, however,there is less information about denitriﬁcation of ground-
water using solid carbon sources under low-temperature
conditions.
Previous studies conducted by authors demonstrated
that biodegradable snack ware (BSW) is a kind of perfect
carbon source for nitrate removal from groundwaterthrough batch experiments, with a relatively high deni-
triﬁcation rate and low cost (Wang and Wang 2009 ). The
main objective of this study was to investigate the deni-triﬁcation performance of a continuous-ﬂow reactor
packed with BSW as carbon source under a low-temper-
ature condition (12 /C176C), with a particular emphasis on
effects of initial nitrate concentration and hydraulic
retention time (HRT) on denitriﬁcation performance, in
order to optimize the running parameters of the reactor totreat nitrate-contaminated groundwater under the low-
temperature condition. This study was carried out
between November 2008 and December 2009 in BeijingAgro-Biotechnology Research Center and Tsinghua Uni-
versity, China.Materials and methods
Materials
BSW is made from reed and sugar cane, manufactured by
Zhejiang Shuangyu Plastic Ltd., China. Prior to use, BSW
was cut into pieces with size of 1.5 91.5 cm.
A synthetic inﬂuent water medium was used to simulate
the composition of nitrate-contaminated groundwater,
which consisted of the groundwater from Changping cam-pus, Tsinghua University, China, containing about 50 mg/L
of nitrogen and 10 mg/L of phosphorus by adding NaNO
3
and KH 2PO4, unless other stated. Any supplementary
nutrients were not added into the groundwater treated in this
study, except for nitrate and phosphate. The characteristics
of groundwater used in the experiments are as follows:nitrate-nitrogen (NO
3-N), 6.5–9.6 mg/L; dissolved oxygen
(DO), 3.0–4.5 mg/L; nitrite-nitrogen (NO 2-N), 0.0 mg/L;
dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 0.0–1.3 mg/L; and pH7.4–7.9.
Activated sludge, obtained from Tsinghe Sewage Plant,
Beijing, was used as the seed source for denitriﬁcation.
Experimental set-up
The continuous experimental set-up consisted of a cylin-
drical plexiglass biodenitriﬁcation unit of 4.5 cm inner
diameter and 45 cm height, completely submerged and
operating with an upward ﬂow mode. The ﬂow rate was
regulated by a peristaltic pump (Fig. 1). The reactor was
packed with 60 g of BSW as carbon source and bioﬁlm
support. Considering the working volume of the reactor
and the volume of BSW packed, HRT with various ﬂowrates was calculated and listed in Table 1.

123Experimental procedure
30 mL of activated sludge, mixed with 3 L of inﬂuent
containing 50 mg/L of NO 3-N, was pumped into reactor.
At the ﬁrst 3 days, the inﬂuent containing activatedsludge was recirculated with daily replenishment of
nitrate and 3 h of HRT at around 25 /C176C, in order to
inoculate BSW with denitrifying microorganisms. Afterthis inoculation period, the reactor was started up (day 1)
with 50 mg/L of NO
3-N in the inﬂuent and 2 h of HRT at
25/C176C. When stable denitriﬁcation rate was achieved,
temperature was lowered down to 12 /C176C, and then the
system run continuously. To optimize reactor operation
under the low-temperature condition, different initialNO
3-N concentration and HRT were set (Table 1). The
system was kept running under each condition listed in
Table 1for 3 days.
Sampling and analysis
Every 24 h, water samples (50 mL) were collected from
the inlet and the outlet of the reactor, obtaining three
replicates for each run assayed. Water samples wereﬁltered through 0.45 lm-pore membrane and were tested
within 1 h of collecting. The ﬁltrate was subjected to
analyses of concentrations of NO
3-N, NO 2-N, ammonia
and DOC according to standard methods (SEPAC 2002 ).
DOC concentration was determined by a TOC analyzer
(TOC-V wp, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Each ofthe measurements conducted during this research was
done in duplicate to provide greater conﬁdence in the
results.Results and discussion
Reactor start-up
After 3-day recirculation of nitrate-contaminated ground-
water containing activated sludge for inoculation microor-
ganisms, the inﬂuent was continuously pumped into thereactor. At the ﬁrst day for system start-up, 34% of removal
efﬁciency was obtained from around 50 mg/L of NO
3-N in
the inﬂuent (Fig. 2). From then on, removal efﬁciency
increased gradually with running time. This suggests that
the system supported by BSW could be started up readily,
and the colonization of the substrate by bacteria was therate-limiting factor for nitrate removal during the start-up
period of the reactor (Volokita et al. 1996 ). After 7 days of
running, almost complete nitrate removal was achieved, andNO
2-N concentration in the efﬂuent was below 0.01 mg/L.
When temperature was decreased to 12 /C176C from day 11
onwards, the breakthrough of nitrate was observed in theefﬂuent; NO
3-N concentration exceeded 30 mg/L (Fig. 2),
and removal efﬁciency reduced to approximately 40%
from nearly 100% at 25 /C176C. At the same time, the relatively
high NO 2-N concentration was observed, ranging between
0.07 and 0.09 mg/L. This could be attributed to metabolic
activities of microorganisms being inhibited due to a low-temperature condition, resulting in the accumulation of
intermediates of denitriﬁcation process.
It has been reported in the literature that the low-tem-
perature conditions affected seriously denitriﬁcation rates
supported by solid carbon sources. Aslan and Turkman(2004 ) used wheat straw as substrate to remove nitrate
from drinking water. When temperature was below 20 /C176C,
removal efﬁciency of nitrate decreased to about 10% fromalmost 100% at over 20 /C176C. Volokita et al. ( 1996 ) reported
denitriﬁcation rate at 14 /C176C was approximately 40% of theTable 1 Flow rate and corresponding HRT and initial NO 3-N con-

123rate observed at 25 /C176C used cotton as carbon source to
denitriﬁcation of groundwater. The obtained experimental
results were similar with above-mentioned ones; however,
the tolerance to the low temperature with BSW as carbonsource was superior to wheat straw and cotton.
Effect of the initial NO
3-N concentration
on denitriﬁcation at 12 /C176C
To investigate the denitriﬁcation performance using BSW
as carbon source under the low-temperature condition,
NO 3-N concentration in the inﬂuent was changed between
15 and 50 mg/L with 2 h of HRT. Figure 3illustrates the
effect of NO 3-N concentration in the inﬂuent on denitriﬁ-
cation at 12 /C176C. Complete nitrate removal was observed as
initial NO 3-N concentration was 15 mg/L.
When NO 3-N concentration in the inﬂuent was
increased from 15 to 20 mg/L, denitriﬁcation rate wasobserved to raise signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3). Denitriﬁcation rate
had a negligible change, and was maintained in the range
of 9–10 mg/(L h) with 20–50 mg/L of initial concentrationof NO
3-N, indicating a zero-order kinetic model can be
used to described the denitriﬁcation process under this
condition (Foglar and Briski 2003 ). Several studies have
shown that denitriﬁcation rate increased consistently with
an increase in the initial NO 3-N concentration using solu-
ble carbon sources (Elefsiniotis and Li 2006 ), which con-
ﬂicts with obtained results. This may be due to two
different types of carbon sources employed, and to differ-
ent concentrations of nitrate and DOC in the inﬂuent,because denitriﬁcation reaction usually follows zero-order
kinetic model when both the carbon source and nitrate or
nitrite are in enough concentration not to limit growth(Glass and Silverstein 1998 ).A linear correlation was observed ( Y=0.00194 X
-0.02259, R=0.9835) between NO
2-N concentration in
the efﬂuent and NO 3-N concentration in the inﬂuent
(Fig. 4). Accumulation of nitrite, a highly toxic interme-
diate in the process of denitriﬁcation, has been reported to
be inﬂuenced by several factors such as oxygen concen-
tration, pH, the type of carbon source, and bioﬁlm com-position (Go ´meza et al. 2000 ,2002 ; Moreno et al. 2005 ).
The experiments clearly indicate that nitrate concentration
in the inﬂuent may affect the nitrite accumulation in thetreated water using BSW as carbon source. As shown in
Fig. 4, nitrate concentration in the inﬂuent had a negligible
effect on DOC content in the efﬂuent, which rangedbetween 5 and 10 mg/L.
Effect of HRT on denitriﬁcation at 12 /C176C
The HRT of the biological reactor is a very important
parameter for nitrate removal (Soares and Abeliovich1998 ; Kesser }u et al. 2002 ; Aslan and Turkman 2006 ;
Behera et al. 2007 ). Since the majority of denitriﬁers are
mesophilic, their metabolic activity would slow downalong with the fall of environment temperature. To extend
the reaction time, therefore, is one of the necessary mea-
sures so that nitrate concentration in the efﬂuent meetsdrinking water standard, when low-temperature ground-
water is treated, or in cold winter (Welander and Mattias-
son2003 ).
To determinate the optimum retention time for NO
3-N
removal, the reactor was operated at different retention
times varying from 2 to 5 h, with ﬂow rate ranged from 230to 92 mL/h at constant NO
3-N concentration of 50 mg/L.
The corresponding hydraulic loading rate ranged from 3.47
to 1.39 m3/(m2day). The effect of changing HRT on the

123removal efﬁciency of nitrate is shown in Fig. 5. The nitrate
removal efﬁciency varied from about 40% at 2 h of HRT to
100% at 5 h of HRT.
The effect of HRT on nitrite accumulation is illustrated
in Fig. 6. An evident increase in NO 2-N concentration in
the efﬂuent was observed as the HRT decreased. Thus,
HRT plays an important role in the denitriﬁcation perfor-mance of the system support by BSW. The low HRT value
resulted in a decrease in nitrate removal and an increase in
nitrite accumulation because of the low contact time formicrobial activity, wash-out of bacteria and extracellular
enzymes (Soares and Abeliovich 1998 ; Aslan and Turkman
2006 ; Behera et al. 2007 ). Although Aslan ( 2005 ) sug-
gested that efﬂuent DOC increased by two times at 2-h
residence time than that at 7-h residence time using ethanolas carbon source, signiﬁcant differences in the DOC con-
centration in the treated water were not observed when
HRT value was varied from 2 to 5 h in this study (Fig. 6),
due to insoluble carbon source used.
The treated water never exhibited noticeable color and
odor, and ammonia was never detected, as well as clogging
of the reactor due to the entrapment of N
2bubbles was not
occurred during the whole experiment.
Although low temperature affected seriously denitriﬁ-
cation rates supported by solid carbon sources, such as
wheat straw and cotton, the optimum running parameters
for the continuous-ﬂow reactor have not been exploredunder the low-temperature conditions. This study indicated
that the complete nitrate removal could be achieved readily
by changing HRT or the initial concentration of nitrate inthe inﬂuent. When the complete nitrate removal was
achieved, the treated water contained the low concentra-
tions of nitrite and DOC.
Conclusion
The nitrate removal efﬁciency of the reactor packed with
BSW decreased to approximately 40% at 12 /C176C from nearly
100% at 25 /C176C under the conditions of 50 mg/L of NO
3-N
in the inﬂuent and 2 h of HRT. If the initial concentration
of NO 3-N was 50 mg/L, 5 h of HRT was needed for the
complete nitrate removal at 12 /C176C. The complete nitrate
removal was also observed when initial NO 3-N concen-
tration was no more than 15 mg/L at 2 h of HRT and at12/C176C. Nitrite concentration in the treated water decreased
markedly as HRT was increased from 2 to 5 h, or as NO
3-
N concentration in the inﬂuent decreased to 15 mg/L from50 mg/L. It was observed that varying HRT and nitrate
concentration in the inﬂuent had no noticeable effect on
DOC content in the efﬂuent under the experimental con-ditions. As a ﬁnal note, the observation that nitrate removal
was complete even at 12 /C176C could have some useful
implications in environmental engineering practice.
