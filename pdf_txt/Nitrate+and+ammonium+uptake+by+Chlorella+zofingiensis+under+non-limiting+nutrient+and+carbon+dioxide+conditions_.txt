INTRODUCTION
A recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is a more
sustainable aquaculture practice than a flow-throughsystem considering that the waste discharge intothe environment can be better controlled, the volumeof water used per kg fish produced can be optimized,the biosecurity can be increased, and reliance on disinfectants can be reduced (Piedrahita 2003, Ver -
degem et al. 2006, Martins et al. 2010). Water purifi-cation in RAS works by removing solid and metabolic
wastes which originate from uneaten feed and fishfecal and non-fecal metabolic losses. Total ammonianitrogen (TAN: ammonia, NH
3+ ammonium, NH 4+)
is a toxic nitrogenous metabolic waste material. It isremoved by nitrification, during which ammoniumis converted to nitrite and subsequently to nitrate.Therefore, nitrate accumulation becomes a commonproblem in RAS. Since nitrate is a fish growth-inhibiting substance (vanRijn et al. 2006, Davidson et

ABSTRACT: Incorporation of microalgae in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) would
absorb the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, thus potentially contributing to water purification.Immobilization or entrapment of microalgal cells in spherical gels is a potential method to incor-porate microalgae in the RAS. Filamentous microalgae are presumed to suit the immobilizationtechnique because the gels can serve as substrates for the microalgae to attach. In the first exper-iment of this study, growth and nitrogen uptake of Stigeoclonium nanum , a filamentous micro-
alga, was compared when cultured using an immobilization technique or in a normal suspension.In the second experiment, immobilized S. nanum was cultured in 4 media with different total
ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO
3-N) concentrations. The results showed a sig-
nificantly higher algal growth and TAN removal by S. nanum immobilized in alginate than for S.
nanum in free suspension culture. When both TAN and NO 3-N were added to the culture medium,
the uptake of TAN by immobilized S. nanum was significantly more efficient than NO 3-N uptake.
Our results indicated that S. nanum was able to grow immobilized in a medium, exhibiting a
higher growth and TAN uptake than when the algae were in free suspension. S. nanum preferred
ammonium over nitrate, which is suitable for RAS that require removal of the total ammonia whichis produced by fish and by organic decomposition in the system.

al. 2014), nitrate must be removed to maintain opti-
mal water quality in RAS. The most common methodof nitrate removal is by partial water exchange; how-ever, this method is not sustainable because nitratedischarge will pollute the environment (vanRijn et al.2006, Martins et al. 2009).
Because microalgae are capable of absorbing am -
monium and nitrate, they are used widely in waste-water treatment (Abdel-Raouf et al. 2012). Dortch(1990) explained that ammonium would be directlyassimilated into amino acids, and thus would betaken up by algae more efficiently and with moreenergy savings than nitrate. More energy is neededfor nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequently toammonium compared to direct uptake of ammoniumby algae (Needoba et al. 2004, Perez-Garcia et al.2011). However, preference for ammonium or nitratemight also occur as a result of genetic and environ-mental conditions such as light, carbon, and heavymetal presence (Raven et al. 1992, Podevin et al.2015).
Water quality in RAS is mainly controlled by het-
erotrophic and autotrophic bacteria (Ebeling et al.2006), and the application of microalgae in RAS islimited. One example is the use of an algal turf scrub-ber (ATS), relying on a periphytic biofilm communityincluding bacteria, microalgae, fungi, and protozoans,to maintain water quality in RAS (Valeta & Ver -
degem 2015). However, an ATS requires a large sur-face area to perform efficiently. Therefore, there is aneed to find another approach which could increasethe efficiency in terms of nutrient uptake and spaceutilization. Thus, introducing microalgae into theRAS by immobilizing the cells in spherical gels couldbe a suitable way to improve water quality and fishproduction. The use of small gels containing algaewould increase the surface area for absorption andincrease the uptake rate. Furthermore, this immobi-lization technique will reduce the risks of contamina-tion of the biofilter by microalgae and reduce the riskof clogging pipes in RAS.
Immobilization or entrapment of microalgal cells in
spherical gels is used in the wastewater industry toease the harvesting method (de la Noüe and Proulx1988, Travieso et al. 1992). To date, about 30 speciesof microalgae have been studied using this immobi-lization technique for removing nitrogen and phos-phorus in wastewater (de-Bashan & Bashan 2010). Ofthe studied species, 75% were green microalgae,e.g. Chlorella, Scenedesmus , and Botryococcus spp.,
20% were cyanobacteria, e.g. Anabaena and Spir-
ulina spp., and the remaining 5% were brown micro-
algae, e.g. diatoms and euglenoid microalgae. Mostof the species tested were planktonic microalgae.
Reports on the use of epiphytic microalgae are few,not only in immobilization technique studies but alsoin wastewater treatment. According to de Paula Silvaet al. (2008), one reason to explain why epiphyticmicroalgae were less studied might be because theireconomic value is unclear. However, the application ofepiphytes such as Cladophora coelothrix Kützing and
Chaetomorpha indica Kützing in Northern Queens-
land, Australia, proved that epiphytic microalgaewere effective in removing inorganic nitrogen andphosphate from aquaculture waste (de Paula Silva etal. 2008). In the case of the RAS, epiphytic micro-algae on substrates posed a lesser risk of cloggingand could be easily removed from the systems in situ .
Previous studies reported that the epiphytic green
microalga Stigeoclonium tenue Kütz. can be an indi-
cator of highly contaminated water because this spe-cies has a high tolerance to heavy metals (Pawlik-Skowronska 2001). This implies that Stigeoclonium
sp. can be potentially used to remove nutrients fromthe wastewater. Moreover, this species also has ahigh lipid content, making it a potential food or bio-fuel source (Praveenkumar et al. 2012).
Motivated by these benefits, we explored the suit-
ability of culturing Stigeoclonium nanum immobi-
lized in alginate beads and its inorganic nitrogenuptake. First we compared the growth and ammo-nium uptake by S. nanum in free suspension to that
of S. nanum immobilized in alginate. Then we ana-
lyzed the rates of ammonium and nitrate uptake inimmobilized S. nanum beads.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microalgal culture maintenance
Stigeoclonium nanum was isolated from a tilapia
grow-out tank in the Aquatic Animal Health Unit,Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti PutraMalaysia. The pure culture was maintained in Bold’sbasal medium, maintained in 24 h light (55−60 μmolphotons m
−2s−1) at 26 ± 0.5°C and a pH of 8.0 ± 0.5.
Low light conditions are suitable for this epiphyticspecies, which is thus a candidate for RAS operatedunder relatively low light conditions. In nature, S.
nanum has an affinity for low light and is commonly
found on substrates in highly shaded forest streams(Steinman 1992).
For immobilization of S. nanum , a pure culture of S.
nanum was inoculated in 3% sodium alginate solu-
tion. Round beads approximately 3 mm in diameter214Mohamed Ramli et al.: Ammonium and nitrate removal by immobilized microalgae
were produced in 2% calcium chloride solidification
solution as an ionic cross-linking agent. One ml ofsodium alginate solution produced 30 ± 2.8 beadsweighing 0.952 ± 0.03 g. Before the beads were used,they were acclimatized in the culture water (beforethe addition of ammonium and nitrate) at the experi-mental light and temperature for 3 h.
Experimental design and procedures
Two experiments were carried out to illustrate the
effects of immobilized microalgae in alginates in aRAS system. The first experiment compared growthand total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) uptake by  free-
living and immobilized microalgae. The negativecontrol for the free-living treatment contained onlyculture water, while the negative control for immobi-lized microalgae contained alginate beads withoutmicroalgae.
In the second experiment, a 2 × 2 factorial design
was used to determine the uptake of TAN andnitrate-nitrogen (NO
3-N). The treatments were (1)
TAN concentration = 0 mg l−1, NO 3-N concentration =
0 mg l−1(T0N0); (2) TAN = 5 mg l−1, NO 3-N = 0 mg l−1
(T5N0); (3) TAN = 0 mg l−1, NO 3-N = 10 mg l−1
(T0N10); and (4) TAN = 5 mg l−1, NO 3-N = 10 mg l−1
(T5N10). Experiments were conducted with 3 repli-cates each.
The experiments were carried out under 55−60 μmol
photons m
−2s−1light at 26 ± 0.5°C and a pH of 8.0 ±
0.5 under 24 h of light per day. The cultures were aer-ated by continuous bubbling of sterile air. The cul-ture medium was lake water that was filtered andautoclaved before use.
Expt 1
An initial concentration of 0.5 g l
−1S. nanum (wet
weight) was inoculated in 1200 ml medium as free-living S. nanum . In the immobilized-beads treatment,
200 g microalgae beads were used which also con-tained 0.5 g l
−1S. nanum .
A microalgal culture medium containing 2.0 mg l−1
of TAN was prepared using an ammonium chloridestock solution (3.819 g NH
4Cl in 1 l of ultrapure
water; 1 ml = 1 mg N). The TAN level was deter-mined on alternate days for 20 d. Every time the TANlevel reached 0 mg l
−1, the stock solution was added
to raise the concentration to 2.0 mg TAN l−1. Beads
(6 g) from the immobilized microalgae treatmentsand 10 ml from the free-living treatments were sampled every 4 d to determine chlorophyll a(chl a)
content and microalgal biomass.
Expt 2
In Expt 2, the same experimental conditions as in
Expt 1 were applied. The TAN stock solution wasprepared as in Expt 1. NO
3-N stock solution was pre-
pared using potassium nitrate (0.7218 g KNO 3in 1 l
of ultrapure water; 1 ml = 100 μg NO 3-N). Concentra-
tions of TAN and NO 3-N in culture water were meas-
ured daily. The experiment lasted for 6 d.
Algal growth rate and total ammonia nitrogen and
nitrate measurement
For microalgal biomass (g dry weight l−1) determi-
nation in the bead treatment, 3 g of beads were solu-bilized by immersing them in 10 ml of 0.5 moltrisodium citrate solution (pH 6.5). Microalgal cellswere then filtered on prewashed GF/F Whatman fil-ter paper and dried overnight at 60°C. For free-livingmicroalgae, 5 ml of culture medium were filtered.The mass difference between prewashed filter paperand filter paper with oven-dried microalgae wasrecorded as the biomass (g) of the microalgae. Thespecific growth rate (d
−1) was calculated from the
exponential growth phase of the microalgae (ln W1−
ln W0)/Δt; where W0is biomass (weight) of micro-
algae at the beginning of the time interval, W1is the
biomass at the end of the time interval, and Δtis the
length of the time interval (T1 − T0). The growths of
free-living and immobilized microalgae were fittedwith a logistic growth model using the non-linearregression function in SPSS. The formula for thelogistic growth model is

Chl awas determined following the standard
method for the examination of water and wastewater(APHA 1999). Beads (3 g) were solubilized in 0.5 molartrisodium citrate at room temperature. Microalgalcells in the solubilized beads were then retained onGF/F Whatman filter paper using a filtration unitattached to a vacuum pump. After filtration, chl a
pigment was extracted by mechanical disruption in10 ml of a 90% acetone solution using a tissue1e()PK

grinder until it was converted to the slurry. The
 solution was allowed to stand overnight at 4°C. The
 clarified extract was then left until it reached room
temperature. Then, 3 ml of extract were transferredto a 1 ml cuvette and absorbance was read at wave-lengths of 750 and 664 nm (before acidification) and750 and 665 nm (after acidification) with a spec-trophotometer (UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, UV-1700series, Shimadzu). Chl ais expressed in μg l
−1.
The pigments were calculated using the equation:
Chlorophyll a(μg l−1) = (2)
where 26.7 is the absorbance coefficient used for chl a
at 664 nm (11.00) multiplied by the ratio ex pressing
the correction for acidification (2.43); V1is the volume
of extract (ml), V2is the volume of sample (l), Lis the
light path length or width of the cuvette (cm), and664
b,665 aare the absorbances of 90% acetone extract
before and after acidification, respectively.
The TAN and NO 3-N concentrations (mg l−1) were
measured by ion chromatography. All chromato-graphic analyses were performed at room tempera-ture using a Metrohm model 882 Compact IC Pluswith suppressor module. Data were collected usinga data acquisition system interfaced to a computerrunning MagIC Net 1.1 software (Metrohm).
In this study, we defined removal of TAN and
NO
3-N by microalgae as their disappearance from
the culture medium (Dortch 1982).
Statistical analysis
A 1-way ANOVA was used in the first trial, with
culture method (presence/absence of alginate beads)as the main factor and sampling day as the repeatedmeasure. In the second experiment, addition/noaddition of TAN and NO
3were the main factors, and
sampling day was included as a repeated-measurefactor. The statistical software SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20) was used for the analyses.
RESULTS
Expt 1
Algal growth in free-living and immobilized micro-
algal beads (Stigeoclonium nanum)
A significant difference in algal biomass and chl a
content was observed between free-living andimmobilized microalgae throughout the experiment
(p < 0.001; Table 1). The specific growth rate ofthe immobilized microalgae was significantly higherthan that of the free-living microalgae (p < 0.05). Thegrowth curve (Fig. 1) showed that the lag phases forimmobilized and free-living microalgae lasted untilDay 4. Growth rates were exponential from Day 4through Day 12 for immobilized microalgae and fromDay 4 through Day 8 for free-living microalgae. Thelogistic growth model could explain 73% of thegrowth for immobilized microalgae and 71.4% for26.7 (664 665 ) ba 1

microalgae increased from 200 to 620 μg l−1.
TAN removal by free-living and immobilized
microalgae
The slope of the graph in Fig. 3 represents the TAN
removal rate (mg l−1d−1). A higher TAN removal ratewas achieved by immobilized microalgae (0.68 mg l−1
d−1) than by free-living microalgae (0.38 mg l−1d−1;
p < 0.05).
Expt 2
The NO 3-N removal rate in treatment T0N10 was
0.53 mg NO 3-N l−1d−1(R2= 0.97) and negligible in
treatment T5N10 (Fig. 4A). The removal rate whichwas shown by the negative slope was 0.51 mg TANl
−1d−1(R2= 0.86) in treatment T5N0 and 0.67 mg TAN
l−1d−1(R2= 0.92) in treatment T5N10 (Fig. 4B). T5N10
had higher TAN removal at the end of the study(83%) when compared to T5N0 (70%). The inter -
action between TAN and NO
3-N was significant
(Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Expt 1
Algal growth in free-living and immobilized micro-

We found that immobilized Stigeoclonium nanum
had 2.3 times greater biomass and 10 times greaterchl acontent than the free-living S. nanum . At the be-
ginning of this study, S. nanum was expected to grow
well in low light, but growth was similarly low as inother microalgal species under the same light condi-217

tions (Imaizumi et al. 2014). For comparison, Imai zumi
et al. (2014) reported that Chlorella zofingiensis
showed a high growth rate of 0.7 d−1at 1000 μmol
photons m−2 s−1, but the growth rate decreased to
0.4 d–1at 75 μmol photons m−2s−1. That study re ported
the maximum production of C. zofingiensis cultured
under  non-limiting nutrient and carbon dioxide con-
ditions. The growth rate of S. nanum in our study was
comparable to that of C. zofingiensis in Imaizumi et al.
(2014) under low light conditions. Microalgal produc-tion is a critical parameter for the uptake of am -
monium, so it may be that if the beads were culturedin high light intensity, the growth rate would in crease,
and ammonium uptake would also increase.
This finding was similar to other studies which re -
ported that immobilization did not negatively affectgrowth of the microalgae Synechococcus elongatus(Aguilar-May & Sánchez-Saavedra 2009), Chaeto-
ceros gracilis , Thalassiosira pseudonana , Pha eo dac -
tylum tricornutum (Moreno-Garrido et al. 2005), and
Dunaliella salina (Thakur & Kumar 1999). One study
with Chlorella vulgaris immobilized in carrageenan
showed a 2 times higher chlorophyll synthesis ratewhen compared to free-living microalgae (Lau et al.1998). In addition to better growth, immobilizedBotryococcus braunii and B. protuberans produced
8% more chlorophyll, 15% more carotenoids, 15%higher dry weight, and 7% more lipid during station-ary growth phases in comparison to free-living cells.In addition, photosynthesis in both species wasenhanced and senescence was significantly delayedunder immobilized conditions (Singh 2003). In otherstudies, chlorophyll content of harvested immobi-lized S. elongatus was 50% higher than that of free218

cells (Aguilar-May & Sánchez-Saavedra 2009). Sce -
ne desmus sp. immobilized in chitosan was found to
have 2.6 higher growth than the free cell cultures(Fierro et al. 2008).
Not all microalgae grow well under im mobilized
conditions, e.g. Skeletonema cos tatum (Moreno-Gar-
rido et al. 2005), Heterocapsa sp., and dinoflagellates
 (Moreno-Garrido 2008). Immobilization changes the
nature of algal growth. When microalgae are con-fined in a limited space, interactions occurring be -
tween the immobilization matrix and the cell wallaffected algal metabolism (Moreno-Garrido 2008).Characteristics of alginate such as alginate chemistry,mechanical and chemical stability, pore size, andpore distribution influenced algal growth (Thu et al.1996). Alginate consists of a family of copolymerswhich contain 1−4-linked β-D-mannuronic acid
andα-L-guluronic acid in different proportions and
sequences (Martinsen et al. 1989). High content ofguluronic acid contributes to high gel strength, vol-ume stability, and large pore size which permits highpermeability. These characteristics are advantageousfor immobilization of living cells  (Martinsen et al.
1989, Thu et al. 1996). Additionally, alginate did notcause extreme physical−chemical changes duringthe immobilization process, which is an advantage ofusing alginate and makes it one of the most usedpolymers for cell immobilization (Moreno-Garrido2008). The carrying capacity (K)and intrinsic growth
rate (r)calculated with the  logistic growth model
were higher for immobilized microalgae than forfree-living microalgae. Carrying capacity for micro-algal growth is normally determined by nutrient content and environmental factors in the culture,
such as light and carbon dioxide. In this experiment,in which nutrient and environmental factors were keptthe same between treatments, the higher carryingcapacity was due to immobilization in alginate. Somemicroalgae attached on the flask wall during theearly growth phase of S. nanum in free suspen-
sion. With increasing biomass, detached mi croalgae
formed floating mats at the surface. In the immobi-lized microalgae treatment, the beads must haveacted as a substrate for the microalgae to grow andcontributed to the carrying capacity in this treatment.This might be the explanation why S. nanum was
able to grow well in immobilization beads. At the endof the experiment, the microalgae protruded out ofthe beads, overgrowing the bead’s surface, but didnot switch to free-living conditions. This situationcould be beneficial to ease the harvesting even inthose beads in which microalgae grew out from thespherical beads.Ammonium removal by free-living microalgae and
immobilized microalgae
In immobilized microalgae culture, ammonium
removal is defined as the adsorption of the nutrientfrom the external medium into the alginate and theuptake of the nutrient from the alginate into themicroalgal cells (Tam & Wong 2000). Ammoniumremoval in the culture media might also be caused bynitrification or by ammonia vo latilization. Therefore,
in this study, a control treatment which containedonly culture water was used to account for nitrifica-tion and volatilization in the water column. Theblank bead control treatment was used to account fornitrification, volatilization of ammonia, and adsorp-tion of ammonium by the alginate. After the controltreatment was taken into account, this study showedthat microalgal cells in beads removed 46% moreammonium than microalgal cells in free-living cul-ture. This result was in accordance with the highergrowth that was achieved in the microalgae beads.Similarly, Lau et al. (1997) suggested that ammoniumconsumption was dependent on the metabolic activ-ity of the algal cells even in an immobilized state. Inthat study, Lau et al. (1997) compared the growth ofChlorella vulgaris in free suspension, and immobi-
lized in alginate and carrageenan. Higher metabolicactivity was indicated by the higher chlorophyll,which was correlated with the higher uptake of nitro-gen and phosphate in the immobilized beads than inthe  free-living C. vulgaris .
In our study, immobilized S. nanum consumed
19.54 ± 0 mg ammonium per 1200 ml flask on thefinal day of the trial. Free-floating S. nanum only
used 40% (7.84 ± 2.61 mg), and empty beads used35% (7.02 ± 2.34 mg) of the total amount that immo-bilized S. nanum had used. This trend was similar to
the result of a previous study where blank chitosanbeads were responsible for removing up to 20%nitrate and 60% phosphate from the culture medium(Fierro et al. 2008). Uptake by the gel matrices couldbe explained by the fact that polyanionicity of thepolysaccharide gels could bind with ammonium in asaturable and mass balance manner (Lau et al. 1997).
In a review by de-Bashan & Bashan (2010), higher
ammonium uptake was observed in most immobi-lized microalgae than suspended microalgae. WhenC. vulgaris immobilized in carrageenan and alginate
were used to treat primary domestic wastewater,over 95% of NH
4+-N was removed in 3 d. However,
only 50% of NH 4+-N was removed by suspended
microalgae during the same time period (Lau et al.1997).219Aquacult Environ Interact 9: 213–222, 2017
De la Noüe & Proulx (1988) found that chitosan-
Phormidium sp. aggregates were capable of remov-
ing 95% of inorganic nitrogen from a secondaryeffluent within 4 to 6 h. Meanwhile, ammoniumuptake by immobilized Dunaliella salina was 17 mg
l
−1h−1compared to free-living D. salina , which only
had 14.5 mg l−1h−1(Thakur & Kumar 1999).
Expt 2
Selective removal of ammonium and nitrate ions
can be defined as the preference of microalgae forammonium ions and inhibition of nitrate uptake inthe presence of the former (Dortch 1990). The latterstudy concluded that the uptake competition be -
tween nitrate and ammonium ions is complex andinfluenced by environmental conditions.
Our study showed that nitrate removal occurred
in treatment T0N10 but not in treatment T5N10,indicating that immobilized S. nanum preferred
ammonium above nitrate as the nitrogen source.The significant interaction found in this study mightindicate that the presence of ammonium influencedthe re moval of nitrate. Past studies reported that
some micro algae preferred ammonium over nitrate
as the nitrogen source (Dortch 1990, Raven et al.1992, Domingues et al. 2011, Parker et al. 2012).Dortch (1990) listed microalgae which prefer ammo-nium, in cluding Chlamydomonas pulsatilla, Phaeo-
dactylum tricornutum , and Chaetoceros gracilis . A
more recent study also showed that Nannochlorop-
sissp. prefers ammonium over nitrate (Hii et al.
2011). In contrast to this, another study found thatNannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris pre-
ferred nitrate over ammonium (Podevin et al. 2015).However, we found no specific report on S. nanum .
Domingues et al. (2011) reported that a preferencefor ammonium was mainly observed in green micro-algae and cyanobacteria but not in diatoms anddinoflagellates.
When both ammonium and nitrate are present,
ammonium will be used first by the microalgae andinhibit nitrate uptake (Ohmori et al. 1977, Serra etal. 1978, Córdoba et al. 1986, Dortch 1990, Hii etal. 2011). A possible explanation is that when ammo-nium enters the cell at a high rate, strong membranedepolarization occurs which blocks the anion/H
+co-
transport (Flynn 1991). On the other hand, duringammonium assimilation, glutamine synthetase (GS),an enzyme which is involved in ammonium metabo-lism in microalgal cells, is active. GS competes withthe nitrate uptake systems for adenosine triphosphate.This competition may cause inhibition of nitrate up -
take (Ohmori et al. 1977).
Knowing the removal rate of ammonium and ni -
trate is important to be able to predict the timeneeded to remove these compounds from the RAS.In this study, the removal rate, as predicted by lin-ear regression in Fig. 4B, showed that the ammo-nium removal rate was higher in cultures whereboth am monium and nitrate were present than in a
culture where only ammonium was present. There-fore, a higher removal percentage of ammoniumwas achieved when both ammonium and nitratewere present. Raven et al. (1992) mentioned a situation where a higher growth rate was achieved
when both ammonium and nitrate were availablecompared to when only ammonium or nitrate wasavailable; however, this situation did not occur frequently. Therefore, in our study, we speculated
that the higher growth rate could link to higherammonium uptake when both nutrients wereavailable. However, a difference in growth wasnot observed in our study (data not shown), proba-bly due to the short experimental period. Until further research is done, this finding remains
inconclusive.
Finally, our results suggest that immobilized S.
nanum is a suitable candidate to be incorporated
into a system in which ammonia is produced daily,as in aquaculture systems; however, if S. nanum is
in corporated for nitrate removal in RAS, an S.
nanum reactor should be placed after the nitrifica-
tion reactor when all ammonia has been convertedto nitrate, in order to reduce the inhibition ofnitrate uptake by the ammonium. Furthermore, theflow into an S. nanum reactor should be regulated
independently from the nitrifying reactor to allowfor a higher retention time and thus a more effi-cient nitrate uptake by S. nanum . Future studies
should investigate how the stability of the beads isinfluenced by aquaculture water conditions. Stabil-ity in this case is related to the time before disrup-tion of the alginate. The information is importantto predict the life span of the beads. In this way,the time to harvest and bead replacement will beknown, allowing for continuous nitrogen removalby the immobilized microalgae in RAS.
