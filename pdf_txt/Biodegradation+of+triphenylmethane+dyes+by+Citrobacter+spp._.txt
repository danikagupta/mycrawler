ABSTRACT  
 
Release of residual dyes into natural water bodies through industrial waste water is considered to be a potential threat to the 
environment. Ther e are several traditional physi o-chemical treatment methods to remove such organic and inorganic dyes , but 
these are costly and creat e secondary sludge disposal problem s. Bioremediation is offers the  best approach to overcome the 
limitations of traditional methods. Thus , this study was undertaken to isolate bacteria possessing high potential to degrade the 
different types of dyes. Total 12 different dyes decolorizing bacterial isolates were obtained from textile  waste water  using 
enrichment and isolation techniques. Out of these isolates, Citrobacter diverses was found to be the most prominent dyes 
decolorizing bacteria. It showed 7 9% to 98% decolorization of  MR (Methyl red), MG (Malachite green), CR (Congo red), CV 
(Crystal violet), CF (Carbol fuchsin) dyes within 72 h.  It showed maximum decolorization in presence of optimum growth 
conditions like 1.5gm/L yeast extract, sucrose and  glucose as a carbon source, peptone and NH 4SO 4 as a nitrogen source of 
medium pH 7.0 at 37°C.  This isolate showed highest decolorization in its free cell form as compare d to its immobilized form. 
According to these results, obtained strain of Citrobacter diverses confirms its application in bioremediation  process  of dyes in 
In-situ.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Dyes are colored organic compounds that are used to impart color to various substrates. They have an affinity to the substrate on 
to which they  are applied . The chemical structure of dyes comprises of a conjugated system of double bonds and aromatic rings. 
On the basis of chemical structure, dyes are classified into Acid d yes, Basic dyes, Reactive  dyes, Dispersive dyes, Azo dyes and 
Anthrquinone dye s [1]. 
 
Dyes are highly stable to light, heat, water, detergents, bleach and perspiration due to their resonance and π -conjugated azo bond 
characteristics. Approximately 10,000 d ifferent dyes and pigments are produced commercially worldwide  including Methyl red 
(MR), Congo red (CR), Malachite green (MG), Crystal violet (CV) and Carbol fuchsin (CF) .  These dyes are used as biological 
stain for many microscopic analysis of cell biology . There are some disinfectant s and antiseptics available constituting these dyes. 
Some of the chemical industries including textile, paper, pharmaceutical and cosmetic in dustries also use these dyes . About 10 % 
to 15% of unused dyes come out in the wastewater  of these industries.  The characteristics of waste water coming out from these 
industries are totally depend ent upon the manufacturing process and dyes which are used  for the process  (Ghale et al., 2014).  If 
such dye containing wastewater  is not treated properly before being disposed into water resource, it can be a problematic. It will 
lead to  enormous environment pollution [5] .  
 
Dyes  containing wastewater  alters the color and quality of ecosystem. Dyes layer can block the penetration of  sunlight from water 
surface preventing photosynthesis , thus affect  aquatic plants and animals. Dyes are mutagenic and carcinogenic in nature. In 
humans, they cause s diseases like haemorrhage, ulceration of skin, severe irritation  of skin, nausea and dermatitis  [7]. 
 
Dyes cannot be removed from waste water by common effluent treatment methods because of their recalcitrant nature  [1]. Various 
physical and chemical methods such as filtration, coagulation, use  of activated carbon  and flocculation  are effective  methods  in 
dyes removal but they are quite expensive. They generate disposal problem of secondary waste. Instead of these traditional 
methods , Biotreatment offers a cheaper  and environmental  friendly alternative for dyes removal . The many experiment is going 
on worldwide in degradation of dyes by biological means [11].  
 
In previous studies, many  bacterial strains have been isolated and found to be able to degrade azo and triphenylmethane dyes. It 
includes Brevibacterium c asei, Enterobacter spp. , Pseudomonas spp. , Morgonella spp. , Providencia rettgeri , Bacillus spp . etc [6] .

 This study evaluated the potential isolated bacterial strain from textile waste in decolorization of MR, CR, CV, CF, and MG dyes 
under in vitro conditi ons. The optimization of medium and immobilization effect on dyes decolorization was also checked to 
achieve maximum decolorization.  
 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS  
2.1  Waste water Sample  and Chemical collection  
Untreated textile effluent samples were collected from small dyeing industries located in Kalyan - Dombivali MIDC area, Dist.: 
Thane. The samples were collec ted in sterile plastic bottles. MR (Methyl red), MG (Malachite green), CR (Congo red), CV 
(Crystal violet) , CF  (Carbol fuchsin) dyes,  microbiological media and medium ingredients were purchased from Himedia 
laboratories,  Mumbai (MH, India).  
 
2.2 Isolation of dye decolorizing bacteria  
The collected samples were enriched by inoculating of sample int o 100 ml of Nutrient broth with 0.0 2 gm/L  dyes concentration . 
The flasks were incubated at R.T.  (28°C±2) for 48 h under shaking conditions (140 rpm).  Enriched samples  were serially diluted 
upto 10-6 dilution . Isolation of bacteria was carried out using spread plate method on nutrient agar plates (0.5% peptone, 0.3% 
meat extract,  0.5% NaCl, 1.5% Agar and 1% individual dye) .  On incubation, the colonies, which showed zone of dyes 
decolorization on agar plate,  were selected for further analysis.  
 
2.3 Primary decolorization screening of selected isolates  
Decolorization activity of isolated bacteria was determined using 100ml Nutrient broth containing 0.02 gm/L dyes separately. 
Medium  was inoculated with 3 ml of 24 h old culture with 0.6 O.D. at 600nm.  Medium without culture was kept  as it is for 
control  analysis . Azo dyes (MR, MG and CR) containing flasks were incubated in static condition while Triphenylmethane dyes 
(CV and CF) conta ining flasks were inc ubated in shaking condition with 120 rpm at R. T. (28°C±2) . The media was checked fo r 
decolorization after every 24 h. After incubation 10ml medium centrifuged at 5000rpm for 15 min. and supernatant was removed. 
Decolorization potential  was assessed by measuring the absorbance of supernatant  at respective O ptical Density (O.D.)  of dyes 
using colorimeter. O. D. taken at respective wavelength is as follows:  MR ( 410nm), MG  (620nm), CV  (580nm), CF ( 520nm) and 
CR ( 530nm). Medium without dye used as blank  for colorimetric readings . Uninoculated dye s containing  medium served as 
control  medium . Decolorization Percentage calculated  by using following for mula:

𝑰𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍𝑶 .𝑫.𝒙 𝟏𝟎𝟎 
Where, Initial O. D. is an O. D. of control dye medium and   Final O. D. is an O. D. of decolorized medium  
 
2.4 Identification of most prominent isolate  
The isolate which showed higher decolor ization efficiency was identified using G ram staining, special staining, specific cultural 
characteristics and  various biochemical tests. The bacterial identity was confirmed by comparing biochemical results with the 
Bergyes manual  of bacteriology .  
 
2.5 Optimization of media to achieve highest decolorization by selected isolate  
The Decolorization activity of selected isolate was optimized by observing the effect of various c arbon sources, Nitrogen sources,  
dye concentration and yeast extract concentration  on the growth of isolate . A working volume of 100ml Mineral salt medium 
(MSM : KH 2PO 4- 0.5gm, K 2HPO 4 - 0.5gm, MgSO 4 - 0.5gm, NH 4SO 4 - 1.0gm, NaCl - 0.5gm, Glucose - 0.5gm, FeSo 4.2H 2O- 
0.02gm, Yeast extract – 1.0gm, D/W – 1000ml ,  pH - 7.0 ) containing 0.02gm/ L was used for optimization studies. The MR, MG, 
CV, CR and CF dyes decolorization activity was optimized separately with 0.02gm/L dye concentration.  
 
2.6 Effect of immobilization  
The isolate was immobilized by using 4% (w/v) Sodium alginate and 6 % (w/v) Calcium chloride (CaCl 2). 50 Ca -alginate beads of 
selected isolate were inoculated in 100ml MSM medium containing 0.02gm/L dyes (MR, MG, CV, CR and CF) separately. For 
control anal ysis, Cell free Ca -alginate beads were added in 100 ml MSM medium  containing dyes. Flasks were incubated at R.T. 
(28°C±2)  for 48  h on shaking condition. D yes decolorization was observed and percentage dye decolorization was calculated.  
 
2.7 Decolorization of Mixture of dyes  
An experiment was carried out to study the efficiency of selected isolates to decolorize mixture of dyes (MR, MG, CR, CF and 
CV).  100ml M SM medium with 1gm/L yeast extract was prepared. The medium was added with all five dyes with 0.02gm/L 
concentration and sterilized. 3ml 24  h old culture of selected isolate having 0.6 O.D. at 600nm was inoculated in medium and 
incubated at R.T. (28ºC± 2ºC)  in shaking condition. Control flasks medium was kept as it is.  The color removal was observed after 
every 24  h. As decolorization was observed percentage decolorization was calculated.  
 
3. RESULTS AND  DISCUSSION  
3.1 Isolation of dye decolorizing bacteria  
The experiment of Enrichment and isolation of dye degrading bacteria from soil sample resulted in total 12 isolates. All these 
isolates were with different colony characteristics showing zone s of dyes decolorization on cultured N utrient agar plates.  In this 
study, N utrient agar medium was found to be suitable for the isolation of dye degrading bacteria as the colonies showed clear zone 
of dye s decolorization and thus could be easily selected for further analysis. Similarly, Kumar et al . (2015 ) isolated 13 
morphologically different dye degrading organisms with zone of clearance from textile effluent samples. A t otal 18 bacterial 
cultures were isolated, purified and screened for the degradation of azo dyes from textile effluent and sludge sample by Seth i et al. 
in 2012.  Mhatre Kirti Jayant; International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology

 3.2 Dyes decolorization assay of selected isolates  
The selected 12 bacterial isolates were tested for decolorization of M R, CR , MG, CF and CV dyes individually. All the selected 
isolates were able to decolorize Methyl red and Malachite green dyes within 24  h to 48  h. However, 06, 03 and 04 bacterial 
isolates showed decolorization of Congo red, Crystal violet and Carbol fuchsin respectively.  Only one isolate showed 
decolorization of all five dyes up  to 79% to 98% within 72 h. umber of isolates decolorizing CR, CV and CF dyes were  found to 
be very less than the number of MR and MG degrading isolates. This may be because of dyes structure as dyes decolorization is 
totally dependent on the structure, no. of azo bonds present, functional groups surrounding the azo b ond, position of functional 
groups on benzene ring and molecular weight of the dyes . MR and MG dyes are having low er molecular  weight than CR, CF and 
CV dyes [2] -[3].  During investigation, decolorization was not observed in uninoculated control flasks. This confirms that the 
isolates decolorized the dyes and decolorizing efficiency was totally dependent on the growth and metabolic activity of the i solate.  
 
3.3 Identification of most prominent isolate  
The selected prominent isolate  was found as rod shaped Gram negative bacteria producing late pink colonies on Mac -conkeys 
plate and found as non - heamolytic on SIBA plate. It was Oxidase negative  and Catalase posit ive organism . It showed positive 
results for glucose, lactose,  xylose, Nitrate, motility, Citrate, Methyl red , Indole, Ornithine decarboxylase  and delayed positive to 
Urease , sucrose , maltose  test. While negative results were observed for VP, PPA (Phenylalanine deaminase) and lysine 
decarboxylase test. These results were compared  with Bergey’s manual and the isolate was identified as Citrobacter diversus. 
Citrobacter genus of bacteria was well  known for its xenobiotic compounds degrading ability and has been studied in the past 
specifically for its dyes degrading ability. Similar to our study, Wang et al. (2009 ), isolated the bacterial culture Citrobacter spp.  
CK3, which showed a strong ability to decolorize various reactive textile dyes, including both azo and anthraquinone dyes. The 
other  Citrobacter  spp., isolated by Sun -young et al. (2002), from soil of an effluent treatment plant of a textile and dyeing in dustry 
showed decolorization  of MG, CV and MR  (100mg/L) up to 80 to 90% within 36h.  
 
3.4 Media optimization  
The results of effect of various growth conditions on decolorization activity of Citrobacter diversus  was mentioned graphically . It 
showed maximum decolorization of all five dyes in presence of 1.5gm/L yeast extract, sucrose and glucose as a carbon source, 
peptone and NH 4SO 4 as a nitrogen source of medium pH 7.0 at 37°C.  It was observed that yeast extract concentration had great 
influence on the decolorization activity of Citrobacter diversus . It showed the highest decolorization of all five dyes in presence 
of 1.5gm/L yeast extract. It showed 97.8%, 97.5%, 88.1% 93.8% and 94.1% decolorization of MR, MG, CR, CV and CF dyes at 
1.5gm/L yeast ext ract and it remained same for 2gm/L yeast extract concentration (Fig .1).

Fig. 3: Effect of Nitrogen source  
 
 
Fig. 4: Effect of Dyes concentration  
 
Citrobacter diversus  showed decolorization in presence of all carbon sources.  Maximum decolorization, 97.8%, 97.5%, 83.3%, 
93.8%, 97.1% of MR, MG, CR, CV and CF respectively was observed in presence of glucose and sucrose as a carbon source 
(Fig. 2). Peptone and NH 4SO 4 as a nitrogen source resulted in maximum decolorization. Citrobacter diversus isolate showed 
95.6%, 95.0%, 83.3%, 93.8% and 92.6% decolorization of MR, MG, CR, CV and CF in presence of both nitrogen sources (Fig. 3). 
The bacterium was  able to decolorize  the dyes efficiently in presence of other nitrogen sources also. NH 4Cl resulted in better 
decolorization efficiency with 93.3% (MR), 92.5% (MG), 76.2% (CR), 89.2% (CV) and 88.2% (CF). The decolorization 
efficiency decreased with NH 4 Oxalate. Least decolor ization was observed with NaNO 3.  
 
Dyes concentration affects the decolorization activity of Citrobacter diversus . The bacterium could degrade MR and MG dyes up 
to 0.1gm/L dye concentration efficiently. 0.1gm/L MR and MG dyes decolorized up to 90% and 91%.  But in case of CV, CF and 
CR dyes, as the concentration of dyes increased the percentage decolorization decreased significantly as shown in Fig. 4. 
Bacterium showed 81.6%, 92.3% and 94.3 % decolorization of CR,  CV and CF dyes at 0.02gm/L dye concentration.  It reduced to 
64.7% (CR), 78.7% (CV) and 65.3% (CF) at 0.1gm/L concentration.  
 
3.5 Effect of immobilization   
Better decolorization activity of isolate was obtained in Free State  as compared to immobilized state.  The immobilized 
Citrobacter  diversus  showed drastic reduction in decolorization activity in immobilized form.  From Fig.5, Free cells of  
Citrobacter  diversus  decolorized the MR, MG, CR, CV and CF dyes up to 98% (24h) , 95% (24h), 79% (72h), 85% (72h) and 
78% (72h) respectively while its immobilized cells showed only 80.0% (48h), 71.4% (72h), 47.7% (120h), 61.5% (120h) and 
57.4% (120h) decolorization respectively.  This increased in decolorization time requirement immobilized form. This could be  
because of loss of “direct” contact in be tween cells surface and dyes. Solid matrix (Ca -alginate) was present in between them and 
thus more time was required for adsorption of dyes on cell surface in immobilized form [9]. 
 
Also, the matrices used for the immobilization play a major role in decolorization activity of cells. Cheng et al. (2012), reported 
improved Crystal violet decolorization ability of Burkholderia vietnamiensis  using PAV - kaolin gel beads than the Ca -alginat e 
beads. They stated that kaolin is good adsorbent and PAV is a better porous material than Ca - alginate which adsorbs the dye and 
transfer on to the cell membrane more quickly than the Ca - alginate and hence it gave fast result of decolorization than the Ca-
alginate beads.

3.6 Decolorization of Mixture of dyes  
Citrobacter diversus exhibited 64% decolorization of mixture of dyes after 96h respectively.  It indicates that the respective 
isolates can withstand the presence of dyes with different structures.  The concomitant presence of more than one dye (MR, MG, 
CR, CV and CF) slightly affects the decolorization activity of  Citrobacter diversus .  
 
4. CONCLUSION  
A textile waste found to be good option for primary screening of dyes degrading bacteria.  The biological decolorization of dyes 
by using Citrobacter diversus  was highly promising, relatively inexpensive, ecofriendly and less sludge producing. I t decolorizes 
complex chemical compounds into simple compounds in a much safer way.  With specific physiochemical factors, selected 
isolates will grow more rapidly and it may result in more decolorization of dyes. It can be applied in in situ  textile efflue nt 
treatment process to achieve maximum dyes decolorization.
