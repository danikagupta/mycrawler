In a previous review of biological and bioinspired silica formation (S. V. Patwardhan et al.,
Chem. Commun. , 2005, 1113 [ref. 1]), we have identiﬁed and discussed the roles that organic
molecules (additives) play in silica formation in vitro . Tremendous progress has been made in this
ﬁeld since and this review attempts to capture, with selected examples from the literature, the key
advances in synthesising and controlling properties of silica-based materials using bioinspiredapproaches, i.e.conditions of near-neutral pH, all aqueous environments and room temperature.
One important reason to investigate biosilicifying systems is to be able to develop novel materialsand/or technologies suitable for a wide range of applications. Therefore, this review will alsofocus on applications arising from research on biological and bioinspired silica. A range ofapplications such as in the areas of sensors, coatings, hybrid materials, catalysis and biocatalysisand drug delivery have started appearing. Furthermore, scale-up of this technology suitable for
large-scale manufacturing has proven the potential of biologically inspired synthesis.
1. Background
The current industrial capacity for silica production is
B1/C2106tonnes per annum, while silica-based materials form
Bd2 billion industry.2This industry covers a wide range
of applications in catalysis, separations, food and drugtechnology, biomedical materials and paints.3,4Biology
produces, through biomineralisation, inorganic materials suchas silica at scales >6.7 /C210
9tonnes of silicon per year,5,6but all
under mild conditions and achieves superior control over
materials produced.7–10The scale of biological silica
deposition is orders of magnitude greater than the industrialcapacity. It appears that biology has identiﬁed ‘clever’ andgreen routes to produce ornate structures of nanomaterials
11
and an understanding of the secrets of biological silicaformation could lead to materials with novel applicationsand/or new technologies for nanomaterials production.
The outline and the scope of the review are as follows. This
review will discuss brieﬂy the process of biological silicaformation, highlighting the key features. We will then focuson recent advances and trends in bioinspired or biomimetic
silica synthesis and ﬁnally present, with selected examples,
applications arising from bioinspired silica research. It shouldbe noted that only selected examples have been presented inorder to aid the ongoing discussions and the readers areencouraged to explore further with the help of extensive listof references provided, while studies not included are by nomeans less important. The review will not consider geologicaland environmental aspects of silica and biosilica.
2. Biosiliciﬁcation
An accurate deﬁnition of biological silica formation—biosiliciﬁcation—has been recently provided: ‘‘ the movement
of silicic acid from environments in which its concentration doesnot exceed its solubility (o2 mmol /L)to intracellular or
systemic compartments in which it is accumulated for subsequentdeposition as amorphous hydrated silica ’’.

 / Table of Contents for this issue7568 Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 7567–7582 This journal is cThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2011review biosiliciﬁcation is used for describing the biosynthesis
of silica that occurs in vivo . In addition, biosilica should be
understood as silica synthesised in vivo and not to be confused
with silica produced in vitro , even though one is using
biomolecules such as peptides and proteins to facilitate thereaction. Biological systems ranging from microorganisms to
animals and higher plants actively uptake, accumulate and
deposit silica. Biosilicifying organisms include diatoms(micro-alga), radiolaria, sponges and plants ( e.g.horsetail and
rice leaves). This review is written from a materials scientist’sviewpoint and is not intended to provide a detailed account ofbiosiliciﬁcation; readers are directed to some excellent mono-graphs on biological silica formation.
7,13–21Nonetheless,
some fascinating features of biosilica are discussed with theirrelevance to developing bioinspired materials.
2.1 Intriguing features of biosiliciﬁcation
Biosilica in organisms primarily serves as a mechanical/
structural support ( e.g.cell walls of diatoms and silica in rice
leaves),
15,17,22,23provides protection from predators ( e.g.silica
spicules from sponges) and acts as sensors ( e.g.biosilica
as optical ﬁbres).24–26Some of the outstanding features of
biological silica formation are listed below and subsequentlydiscussed with comparison being made to synthetic silica
formation:
/C15Ornate and hierarchical structures;
/C15Mild pH;
/C15Ambient temperatures;
/C15Environmentally friendly and all-aqueous (‘‘green’’);
/C15Controlled;
/C15Involvement of organic components.
As evident from Fig. 1, biosilica exhibits hierarchical
organisation of particles and pores over several length scalesranging from tens of nanometres to tens or hundreds of
micrometres.
27Such structural sophistication is rarely
achieved in synthetic approaches, especially under mildconditions. The organised biosilica structures in diatoms havebeen proposed to exist over three length scales: microscale(of the order of the cell), mesoscale (higher order assemblies of
biosilica particles and pores) and nanoscale (primary particles
and their aggregates).
13,14,28
A second, and perhaps the most interesting, facet of
biosiliciﬁcation is the mild pH and ambient temperatures(typically mildly acidic to neutral pH and o401C).
29,30Prior
to the development of bioinspired silica synthesis, silicaformation at near-neutral pH and room temperature hadproven diﬃcult. One of the reasons being the rate of hydrolysishas been reported to be the lowest at pH = 7 with gelationtaking longer than at any other pH.
31,32Typically, the
synthetic approaches to silica and silicates involved
solution based sol–gel chemistry operating at low temperature
(o100 1C).31,33–36Sol–gel syntheses employ alkoxysilanes as
silica precursors, which are toxic but also possess limitedsolubility in water and often a mixture of water and analcohol as the reaction solvent is needed. Biosilica formationon the other hand occurs in all-aqueous environments andutilises (unsaturated) silicic acid—soluble and non-toxicform of silica—which typically occurs at o200mM in natural
waters.
6,13,37
Biosiliciﬁcation is under strict and indirect genetic control,
where the mechanisms underpinning and the key processes
involved in biosiliciﬁcation such as silicic acid uptake, storage/
transport and deposition are biologically regulated. However,it is noted that the formation of Si–O–C, Si–C or Si–N bondsin vivo have yet to be experimentally conﬁrmed. Biochemical
and biological research has revealed that biosilica formationinvolves organic biomolecules such as proteins, peptides andsmall amines in stages crucial to biosilica formation such assilicon uptake, transport and deposition.
7,13,17,19,20
2.2 Secrets at molecular level
While one admires the way nature has ‘optimised’ the methods
for the deposition of organised silica-based materials, it isfascinating to understand, on a molecular level, the workingsof biosilicifying organisms.
38Combining approaches from
molecular biology, genetics, protein science and cell biology,researchers have unveiled mechanistic secrets of biosilicaformation (Fig. 2, top part). Examples include the identiﬁca-tion of silicon transporters (SiT) which are postulated toactively uptake silicic acid from the environment into thesilicifying organisms;
12,13,39–41propylamines from diatoms
and sponges that can rapidly precipitate silica in vitro in model
reactions;42,43and silicatein proteins from a range of silicifying
sponges.19,44–46
In addition to biological investigations, research on model
systems in vitro has been fruitful in identiﬁcation of mecha-
nisms (Fig. 2, middle section). Such studies include, forexample, probing the interactions between biomolecules andsilicates in solution
47–58or understanding assembly and
organisation of organic as well as inorganic building blocksin silica formation.

whereby silica formation under mild conditions has been
achieved,1,62,63and a range of applications are envisaged, as
discussed in section 5 (Fig. 2, bottom section).
2.3 Milestones in bioinspired silica research
When we consider the timeline of important advances in the
ﬁeld of biological silica research, it appears that signiﬁcantprogress has been made in last 10–15 years (Fig. 3). However,it is noted that a substantial number of biosilica studies, inparticular on cell biology, reported prior to 1990s haveprovided the groundwork for recent progress in gainingmolecular-level understanding of biological silica formationand biosilicifying systems. With due respect to those investi-gations, since this review focuses on relatively key advances,
especially those profoundly inﬂuencing in vitro silica
formation, for further discussion the readers are directed toexcellent reviews.
13–16,39,64–66
Research in the late 1990s and early 2000s were dominated
by the identiﬁcation of silicon transporters in diatoms andplants and silica-depositing proteins and small amines indiatoms, plants and sponges (Fig. 3a).
1,13,40,41,43–45,67–72
Genomes of two diatom species have been recently sequenced,enabling further understanding of biosiliciﬁcation,
73,74with
several genes associated with biosilica synthesis in diatomsidentiﬁed.70Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the
diatom biosilica synthesis cascade may be altered by themanipulation of speciﬁc biosynthetic pathways.

3. From biological silica to bioinspired synthesis
As detailed in the foregoing, biosilica is nanostructured and
sophisticated and is produced by a complex biologically
controlled process. One of the most important reasons behindlearning about biosilicifying systems is to be able to developnovel materials and/or technologies suitable for applications.The question then is how do we transfer the knowledgeobtained from biosiliciﬁcation into in vitro synthesis of
sophisticated silica-based materials and further developbiologically inspired functional materials or materials techno-logies. As an answer to this question, three ways are discussedbelow: identiﬁcation of organic biomolecules involved inbiosiliciﬁcation; in vitro model studies using bioextracts; and
the use of bioinspired custom-made additives.
3.1 Involvement of biomolecules
One way forward, as demonstrated by several research groups,
is to employ biomolecules identiﬁed from biosilicifyingorganisms into in vitro model systems of siliciﬁcation. For
example, Sumper, Kro ¨ger and co-workers have identiﬁed a
series of proteins (silaﬃns and cingulins) and propylaminesfrom diatoms which have been proposed to be responsible forsilica deposition in vivo .
42,60,76–80These biomolecules have
demonstrated the ability to control silica formation in vitro
in aqueous systems and under mild conditions of pH
and temperature. Similarly, ‘bioextracts’ isolated from
sponges (silicatein proteins and propylamines),43–45,81,82
plants67,69,83–85and choanoﬂagellates86have been successfully
used to produce unique silicas in vitro . In the aforementioned
model studies, not only was the controlled formation ofnanostructured silica demonstrated, but mechanisms under-pinning biosiliciﬁcation have also started to surface.
3.2 Eﬀects of physical and chemical properties of biological
and bioinspired additives
Inspired from the intriguing ability of biomolecules to form
silica in vitro , further attention had been given to the physical
Fig. 4 Selected examples of the biological, bioderived, bioinspired and synthetic additives used in silica formation in vitro . These additives are
shown in ﬁve groups of polypeptides,47,48,92,94,96–99,106,112polysaccharides,115,134peptides76,93,130/proteins56,117,131,245/enzymes,111,135small
molecules47,57,107,108,133,136,139,150and synthetic polymers (including dendrimers).91,105–107,109,110,113,114,116,118–122,124–129,132,137,138See text for

behaviour of organic bioextracts in solution or on surfaces andtheir interactions with silicates species were probed.
60,87–90
Investigations of silaﬃn proteins and their assembly in vitro
in the presence of varying salt concentration can be givenas an example.
59,60However, due to the complex nature
of bioextracts, and issues of their availability and purity,
investigating their properties could prove diﬃcult at times.Therefore, analogues of bioextracts have been used, allowingresearchers access to simple or model biomolecules, non-biological additives or in some cases, commercially availablemolecules.
Examples of such biologically derived additives include the
R5 peptide which has an amino acid sequence derived fromone of the silaﬃn proteins; several homo- and blockco-polypeptides; and amino acids (Fig. 4).
47,50,91–98R5 peptide
has the amino acid sequence N-SSKKSGSYSGSKGSKRRIL-C
which resembles to one of the silaﬃn proteins (NB. Silaﬃn
proteins possess post-translational modiﬁcations to accommo-date propylamines). Knecht and Wright prepared a range ofmutant peptides wherein parts of the sequence were omitted oraltered.
98The analysis of these peptides, based on their ability
to form self-assembled structures in solution and to precipitatesilica, revealed that the C-terminus peptide motif wasimportant in the peptide’s activity.
Polylysine is another example which highlights the impor-
tance of physical and chemical properties of biomolecules insilica formation. Polylysine (in both
L- and D-forms) has been
reported to precipitate unusually structured hexagonal silica
platesB50 nm thick and 100s nm to one micron size sides,
where silica was found to be amorphous (Fig. 4 and 5j).99–102
Experiments performed on polylysine to probe its secondary
conformations, dynamic nature of self-assembly, crystallisa-tion and interactions with silica species in solution revealedthat in the presence of multivalent ions such as phosphate orsilicate, polylysine, which is typically in an unordered(or random coil) state, rapidly transforms to a helicalconformation. At a higher length scale, several helices packtogether into hexagonal single crystals where the helices are
arranged perpendicular to the plates (the height of helices
equals the plate thickness). The hexagonal crystals of poly-lysine further template condensing silicates forming hexagonalsilica where silica remains amorphous. This incrediblycomplex but very interesting facet of the polylysine-silicasystem has been utilised to develop responsive materials suchas those that can ‘switch’ their morphologies.
100,103Further-
more, block- co-polypeptides from lysine and leucine have
demonstrated a remarkable ability to ﬁne tune the materialstemplated simply by controlling processing conditions such asnature and concentrations of counter ions, and lengths of
lysine and leucine blocks.
104
3.3 Customised additives
As a consequence of a number of investigations, some given
above, rules that govern silica formation in the presence of
additives have been identiﬁed and validated. Some of theserules include the necessity of the presence of speciﬁc aminoacids in a peptide such as lysine; abundance of cationicallycharged moieties; or the importance of self-assembly of
additives prior to and during silica polymerisation. In orderto further probe the inﬂuence of biological and bioinspiredadditives on silicate species and silica polymerisation, furtherresearch had been directed towards the use of custom-madeadditives. These additives, which include synthetic polymers
and block co-polymers, small amines and dendrimers
(Fig. 4),
47,48,57,92,94,96–99,105–138had been typically well-
characterised in terms of their chemistry and their propertiesreadily measured. Furthermore, these tailored additives oﬀertwo important advantages: ability to probe mechanismsgoverning the complex process of silica formation but one ata time; and possibility of controlling properties ( e.g.structure
and assembly) of silicas synthesised. Since this review isfocussed on key advances and applications, a comprehensivelist of additives has not been provide, but a ﬂavour of therange of additives used is presented in Fig. 4 with selected
examples discussed below.
The use of customised additives has made a signiﬁcant
contribution to the ﬁeld of bioinspired silica research and thispoint will be highlighted below with a range of examples ofadditives used and their outcomes. One group of bioextractsisolated from diatoms and sponges are linear propylamineswith variable molecular size (or chain length) and levels ofmethylation. However, the eﬀects of the length of theseamines, the level of amine methylation, and the size of theamine spacers was unclear. Belton et al. synthesised small-
amines by varying amine spacers, amine lengths and levels of
methylation in order to study silica formation in the presence
of these amines (Fig. 4 ‘‘ small molecules ’’).
57,139It was
reported that the balance between the charged and unchargednitrogen atoms within a single amine molecule was crucial insilica formation. The understanding of molecular interactionsbetween these amines and silica further allowed the controlledand rapid (within 30 s) synthesis of hollow particles under mildconditions Fig. 5l).
57,140
We have seen in the sections above that cationically charged
molecules assist silica formation under mild conditions. Thesemolecules include amino acids such as lysine and arginine,
where the interactions between anionic silicate species and
ammonium or guanidinium groups from amino acids havebeen proposed. Coradin et al. utilised this property to
design and synthesise surfactants based on arginine (Fig. 4‘‘small molecules ’’).
108These novel surfactants possessed dual
features—the ability to promote silica formation and to self-assemble into templates for silica—leading to the formation ofnovel porous materials (see section 4.3 for the importance ofporosity for silica-based materials).
Further examples can be provided of designer amine-
containing polymers and block co-polymers with a range of
architectures and ability to produce self-assembled structures
in solution. These include star-shaped polyethyleneimines (PEI)and copolymers of poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)polymers (Fig. 4 ‘‘ synthetic polymers ’’).
120,129The star-shaped
PEI exhibited the ability to respond to the solution processingconditions and assemble into a range of structures. When thisproperty of PEI was exploited, Jin and Yuan were able toproduce a variety of shaped-silicas including hollow nano-ﬁbres (Fig. 5k).

129These core-shell polymers
were highly eﬀective in synthesising monodispersed silica-polymer hybrid particles (Fig. 5c).
We have seen a rapid growth in design of new additives
which are able to control one or more aspects of silicaformation including condensation rates, morphology andporosity. There are various other examples of customisedadditives, however, instead of listing all such molecules,their importance is provided here with the help ofselected and representative examples. Some of the keybeneﬁts realised from bioinspired silica research arediscussed below.4. Key outcomes of bioinspired silica
Bioinspired synthesis of silica has completely changed theway scientists think of designing novel silica-based materials.The outcomes from bioinspired silica research can besummarised by discussing the ability to control materialsproperties and synthetic methods. In the case of amorphoussilica, typically, method of synthesis, porosity, morphologyand particle size are important factors which determinetheir properties and ultimately their use. Table 1 listssome of these properties with the nature of control possibleas a consequence of bioinspired synthesis. One of themost important outcomes is the development of routes under
mild synthetic conditions—all aqueous solutions, near-neutral
pH and ambient temperature. This feature has several

sensitive materials and is discussed below.
4.1 Ability to control silica condensation rates
The use of a range of additives has enabled researchers to
control the rates of silica condensation from very rapidinstantaneous reactions to near stabilisation of silicic acids.For example, when small amines such as ethyl- or propyl-amines with six to seven amines were used, precipitation ofspherical silica particles was evi dent within 30 s for concentrations
as low as 30 mM of silicon.
52,57,139,141When compared with
silica polymerisations in the absence of any additives, earlystages of silica condensation in the presence of a propylamineshas been reported to be 14-times faster.
57On the other hand,
certain polymeric amines such as polyvinyl imidazole,
phosphonated chitosan and polyaminoamide dendrimers havebeen able to inhibit silica condensation completely byformation of a soluble but molybdate inactive complex(i.e.oligomers larger than trimers) between additives and
silicon (in an unknown form).
132,142,143While the rapid
reactions would ﬁnd applications in industrial productionwhere short residence times could be preferred, silica stabilisa-tion has potential in water treatment and the treatment ofindustrial scaling and fouling caused by silicates.
144–149
4.2 Tailored materials
The bioinspired silica research has seen the most progress in
the variety of silica structures and morphologies that could beproduced as a result of tailoring chemistries of additives(Table 1). Morphologies thus produced include sphericalmonodispersed particles, ﬁbres, sheets, ﬁlms/coatings, hollowtubes, porous gels, hollow particles and so on (Fig. 5). Mono-dispersed silica particles ranging from tens of nm to several mm
sizes have been synthesised using additives such as diatombioextracts,
60cyclic amines133,136,150and block-copolymers
(Fig. 5a–c).129The knowledge gained from biological silica
formation and in vitro model studies about silica formation in
solutions (‘homogeneous’ systems) had been further trans-
ferred to controlling silica growth on surfaces for devicefabrication (Fig. 5d–g and see section 5.2). Brott et al. have
demonstrated the patterning of silica particles on a polymer tofabricate polymer-silica hologram created by two-photon-induced photopolymerisation; the material exhibited enhanceddiﬀraction eﬃciency, optical performance and mechanicalproperties due to the presence of patterned silica particles.
93
Several approaches have been successfully employed toprepare coatings of silica particles, monoliths and otherstructures
116,122,151–155and their applications in fabricating
sensors and devices are discussed in section 5.
4.3 Porosity and surface area
Another important property of silica is its porosity (and surface
area), which is essential in applications such as adsorption,catalysis, ﬁllers and composites. Sol–gel templated synthesishas been very widely used to obtain hierarchical inorganicmaterials, largely silicates.
31,33,156–159Due to the ﬂexibility,
solution processing and low temperatures ( o100 1C), sol–gel
method has been adapted to given synthetic conditions(e.g.solvents and precursors) and processing parameters ( e.g.
pH and temperature) to generate a range of porous and hybridhierarchical materials including porous thin ﬁlms, hybrid
nanoﬁbres, monoliths and organic-inorganic composites.
160–164
High surface area (>700 m2g/C01) and high porosity silicas such
as MCM- and SBA-silicas can be prepared synthetically usingsol–gel processing, but only under harsh conditions and usingtime consuming multistep methods.
35,36,165,166The ﬁeld of
sol–gel derived hybrid materials has been extensively reviewedin the past.
161–164,167On the other hand, industrial precipitated
silicas, which are prepared by simply neutralising sodiumsilicate with mineral acids, typically possess low surface areas(o150 m
2g/C01) and broad pore size distribution.140In contrast
to both industrial materials and traditional sol–gel processing,
bioinspired routes to produced silicas have been able to
tailor the surface areas ranging from o10 up to 1030 m2g/C01
and primary pore sizes o2 to 60 nm—all under mild
conditions.48,50–52,57,108,168–170For example, Coradin et al. used
novel amino acid derived surfactants which produced silicasunder neutral pH conditions with a unique bimodal distributionof pores (mesopores: 2.5–3.5 nm and meso-to-macropores:
10–100 nm) and high surface areas (>500 m
2g/C01).108On the
other hand, Sun and co-workers introduced polyethylene glycol(PEG) into the silica precipitating systems under acidicconditions (pH B4). PEG samples, as a function of molecular
weights, were able to produce porous silicas upon aging at 80 1C
with surface areas as high as 1030 m
2g/C01and pore sizes as low
as 2 nm (or less).168In contrast, propylamines, analogous to the
amines found in diatoms and sponges, have been able toprecipitate silica with surface areas o10 m

however recognised that more progress is warranted in order toproduce materials that are comparable to or better than theircommercial counterparts.

View Online7574 Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 7567–7582 This journal is cThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2011The strategies to synthesise hybrid silicates typically involve
the addition of organic ‘‘dopants’’ to the sol–gel system or theuse of organically modiﬁed silane precursors. Although a widerange of organic-inorganic composites could be envisaged bythis approach, typically with hierarchical structures, itremained largely incompatible with biological materials such
as cells, proteins and enzymes due to acidic conditions, highly
reactive precursors and denaturation of biologicals duringshrinkage of materials caused by drying.
172In order to accom-
modate biological samples into sol–gel materials, researchershave been developing mild routes. The state of research onbioencapsulation into silica gels, prior to the discovery ofmolecular secrets of biosiliciﬁcation, is brieﬂy summarisedbelow with selected examples. Sol–gel synthesis was madecompatible to biological materials by incorporating severalmodiﬁcations which typically include the use of custom-synthesised biocompatible precursors; the addition of stabilising
agents; the omission of alcohol usage; and/or the introduction
of multistep procedures.
Livage and co-workers have developed methods to
encapsulate whole bacterial cells into sol–gel silica matrix byutilising all-aqueous synthesis, the addition of stabilisingagents such as glycerol and the replacement of alkoxysilanesprecursors (which produce alcohol that can be detrimental tobiological samples) with water soluble silicate. In the bio-composites, 50–60% of the entrapped cells were preservedfor up to one month in wet gels.
173–178Another modiﬁcation
to sol–gel synthesis for rendering biocompatibility involves a
two step process:179–183in the ﬁrst step, an alkoxysilane is
hydrolysed under acidic conditions to produce a sol. Typicallyin this step, the use of alcohol is avoided, however, it has beenreported that any alcohol added or produced during thehydrolysis can be subsequently removed.
184In the second step,
the sol is added to a buﬀered solution of biological samples(e.g.enzymes or cells) thereby maintaining the pH and the
aqueous conditions that are necessary to avoid deactivation ofbiological materials. Furthermore, several research groupsreported the preparation of silica gels with immobilisedenzymes by the introduction of either stabilising agents such
as carbohydrates, glycol or amino acids, or using biocompatible
organically modiﬁed silane precursors.
181,185,186
The aforementioned approaches provide a substantial
improvement to the traditional sol–gel synthesis and thereforethey have been widely used to immobilise enzymes and cells.However, these modiﬁed sol–gel methods still suﬀer fromlong gelation times of several hours to weeks;
185high
silicate concentrations;180tedious multistep procedures;182,184
and the requirement of custom-synthesised biocompatibleprecursors.
186
Mild synthetic conditions of bioinspired silica formation have
allowed the formation of composite/hybrid materials of silica
with peptides, proteins, enzymes, small organic molecules,drugs, polymers, quantum dots, catalysts nanoparticles, andthe list continues (for selected examples see Fig. 5h–p).
187–193
This ability, perhaps, will emerge as one of the largestadvantages of bioinspired silica synthesis when one considerspotential applications (discussed in detail in section 5).
Before we close this section and focus on the applications
developed from bioinspired synthesis, the readers are madeaware of a few issues. In order to understand and control
bioinspired synthesis, in depth knowledge of silica condensa-tion and speciation is required. It should be remembered thatsimply changing the silica precursor can aﬀect the systemtremendously which has been highlighted in a recent study;
58
the report also identiﬁes the silicate species present at a given
time in the early stages of silica condensation. Furthermore,
synthetic and analytical parameters should be very carefullychosen which include the use of buﬀers, presence of electro-lytes, purity of additives, concentrations of Si and additives,and analytical techniques used. Each of these factors cangreatly aﬀect silica formation and therefore may also inﬂuencethe conclusions drawn.
1
The solubility of silica and silicates, measured as the
concentration of orthosilicic acid, has been reported to occurat 5.2–15.6 mM in sea water and 5.2–36.4 mM in fresh
water.
6,32,194The condensation of orthosilicic acid, sometimes
termed autopolymerisation , generally occurs at concentrations
>2 mM, thus suggesting that the natural waters are highlyundersaturated. However, biosilicifying organisms accumulateorthosilicic acid from their environment that is vastlyundersaturated with respect to silicon and form sophisticatednanopatterned organic-inorganic silica-based composites. Incontrast, in vitro silica precipitation studies, which typically
operate under supersaturated concentrations of orthosilicicacid (typically 30 mM or 100 mM), have failed to producesilica from undersaturated solutions.
150Although biosilica
and silica formation from undersaturated solutions remains
open for further investigations, the enigmatic nature of bio-
siliciﬁcation perhaps makes it more intriguing.
5. Applications
The development of applications arising from biosiliciﬁcationand bioinspired silica has been slower than perhaps expected.One of the reasons could be the amount of groundworkrequired for building important and fundamental understandingof silica-biomolecule systems. We have discussed some of themain outcomes of these studies above and it is believed that wenow have a toolbox for developing novel materials andapplications. Although progress has been slow, there havebeen a range of applications already demonstrated in the areasof sensors, coatings, catalysis and biocatalysis, drug delivery,hybrid materials and scale-up (Fig. 2, lower section). With
selected examples, we set out to explain and discuss how the
understanding of biological and bioinspired silica formationhas been successfully transferred. It should be noted thatthe direct use of biosilica and biosilicifying systems forapplications is out of the scope of this review and readersare directed to the appropriate literature.

5.1 Biocatalysis and drug delivery
Luckarift et al. utilised the ability of a peptide (R5) derived
from diatoms to form silica under mild conditions anddeveloped a one-pot, one-step synthesis of silica-enzymecomposites.
187This method was used to immobilise butyryl-
cholinesterase onto silica where superior performance, up to90% immobilisation eﬃciency and high loading ( B20 wt%)
was achieved (Fig. 6a). The co-precipitation of enzyme and

substantially reduced enzyme leaching. As noted in section4.4 above, prior to the advent of bioinspired silica, enzymeencapsulation/immobilisation onto silica under all-aqueousconditions, room temperature and without the need of speci-ality reagents had rarely been possible. Recently, Sun et al.
elegantly demonstrated cascade reactions for convertingcarbon dioxide to methanol in three steps using a combinationof three dehydrogenases co-immobilised.
191When compared
with free dehydrogenases, the co-immobilised system exhibited
higher yield, improved thermal and chemical stability, greatershelf-life and ability to reuse. It was further demonstrated thatbioinspired silica technology was suitable for many enzymes,particularly sensitive enzymes, and a variety of reactorconﬁgurations such as ﬂuidised bed, microﬂuidic devices orpacked bed could be employed.
187,188,190,192,199–205
There have been further eﬀorts to encapsulate biologically
relevant materials into bioinspired silica such as ﬂuorescentdyes, model drug molecules or antimicrobial agents.125,206–208
Sano et al. have reported the development of an anticancer
drug delivery system using a bioinspired silica technique.193
A protein was designed which possessed dual functionalities—silica precipitation ability and anticancer activity—and it wasused to polymerise silica thereby immobilising itself on to silica
(Fig. 6b). In aqueous solutions, silica was found to hydrolyse
and slowly release the anticancer protein causing cancer celldeath. This example highlighted the importance of the abilityto control silica condensation (also discussed in section 4),which has proven to be critical in developing applicationswhere, for example, silica needs to hydrolyse to release drug orit needs to be highly cross-linked to avoid any leaching ofenzymes in biocatalysis.
5.2 Sensors
A second set of applications discussed here is the preparation
of sensors using a bioinspired silica technology.
208–212Millner,
Chaniotakis and their respective co-workers have fabricatedelectrochemical biosensors using carbon nanoﬁbres (CNF)or metallic electrodes containing silica-enzyme coatingsdeposited using bioinspired method (Fig. 7a).
209–213Acetyl-
cholinesterase (AChE) was immobilised on electrodes, whichcatalyses the formation of acetic acid and thiocholine (TCh)
from acetylthiocholine (ATCh); the reaction can be monitored
by detecting an increase in anodic current upon the oxidisationof thiocholine on the electrode. It was reported that, inaddition to improved operational life, thermal stability andprotection against protease attack, the CNF-AChE-silicabiosensor system demonstrated a linear response over a widerrange, greater sensitivity and faster response when comparedwith silica-enzyme system without the CNF (Fig. 7b).

Supported metallic particles on silica and other ceramic
matrices have been widely used for applications such asmetal-catalysed reactions, molecular electronics, opticallyactive materials, sensors, etc. Bioinspired methods have been
used to synthesise metallic, metal oxide and bimetallic nano-particles supported on silica.
114,188,192,213Dendrimer or
peptide mediated silica formation was adopted for theencapsulation of quantum dots of CdSe–ZnS and it was foundthat even upon encapsulation in silica, the quantum dots
retained their optical activity (Fig. 8a).
114,188Similarly, silica-
gold nanoparticle composites were prepared using dendrimersor small amines where the gold nanoparticles remained active(Fig. 8b).
114,192Furthermore, enzyme-iron oxide-silica hybrid
particles were synthesised—the enzyme was used for catalysingreactions while the iron oxide particles proved valuable formagnetically separating hybrid particles upon completion ofthe reaction for reuse.
188
O’Leary et al. prepared metallic catalysts supported on silica
by starting with silane functionalised pincer-metal complexes(Fig. 8c).
214These complexes were condensed with an alkoxy-
silane in the presence of silicatein protein to produce metal-
silica composites which demonstrated applications in sensorsand catalysis. Pt-silica prepared using this method were usedfor SO
2sensing while Pd-silica hybrids were successfully tested
for Heck reactions for carbon-carbon coupling.214
5.4 Non-silicates
Research on bioinspired silica has also produced insights for
synthesis and fabrication of non-silicates such as ceramic,metallic and bimetallic materials which are extremely valuable
in commercial applications in areas such as devices andsensors fabrication, catalysts, cosmetics, electronics, opticallyactive materials, etc. This has been a key advancement especially
for producing materials from non-biological elements includinggermanium,
117,215–218titanium,134,137,191,206,218–226gallium,227
barium,228zinc,229platinum,230zirconium220,231and copper230
where direct examples of nanomaterial formation usingbiomolecules is not available.
19Although an excellent review
already exists on ‘‘ Protein -and Peptide -Directed Syntheses of
Inorganic Materials ’’,232due to the importance of these
systems, some examples are given below.
The biosilica forming silicatein proteins extracted from
sponges have successfully produced titania (TiO 2) and zirconia
(ZrO 2) under mild conditions.19,219,220,222,227The catalytic and
templating eﬀects of silicatein were apparent when in theabsence of silicatein, oxide formation required high tempera-
tures or alkali. It was reported that silicatein mediated titania
formation showed a delayed phase transition from anatase torutile under thermal treatment. Furthermore, designerrecombinant proteins based on the sequence of silaﬃn proteinsisolated from diatoms or other well-known proteins havedemonstrated the ability to produce non-silicates.
56,117,233,234
Kro¨geret al. reported that such novel proteins were able to
catalyse the formation of oriented rutile microcrystals undermild conditions of temperature and pH (Fig. 9a).
223As noted
already, since the formation of rutile requires extremeconditions of temperature or pH, the advantages of
bioinspired techniques for the synthesis of nano- and micro-
crystalline titania are clearly highlighted, especially whenconsidering its applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics,gas sensing, and pigments.
A synthetic polymer—polyallylamine—which has been
demonstrated to control silica formation in vitro under mild
conditions, had been reported to precipitate spherical andelongated germania particle—all under neutral pH and inaqueous systems (Fig. 9b).
215Taking into account the
potential commercial applications of germania-based materialsin ﬁbre optics, waveguides, optoelectronic devices and
complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS),
the bioinspired route to germania is highly important.

by demonstrating the ability of amino acids and small peptidesto nucleate and stabilise a range of zero-valent metallicnanoparticles.
230These examples clearly demonstrate the
importance of transferring knowledge gained of the chemistryof bioinspired silica.
5.5 Scale-up and process intensiﬁcation
Recognising the beneﬁts of the newly invented bioinspired
synthesis of nanomaterials, one could appreciate the savingsand reduction in waste production upon realisation of thesemethods on an industrial scale. In order to establish theviability for an industrial-scale production of nanomterials,scale-up (often jokingly referred to as ‘‘ bucket chemistry ’’)
and/or process intesiﬁcation of the bioinspired synthesis is
crucial.
235The core aspects of the chemistry of bioinspired
synthesis of silica such as reagents, catalysts (or additives) andconditions have been extensively studied and results reportedin the literature.
50–52,57–59,112,236Bioinspired synthesis of
nanomaterials is currently essentially a batch scale methodproducing mg to mg quantities. In order to commercialise this
method, process engineers need to identify and optimisepractical ways and equipment conﬁgurations.
237It is noted
that scaling-up a bench-top reaction is often not trivial forreasons such as non-linear scaling of laws governing transport
phenomena as well as surface area to volume ratios.
237,238
Furthermore, heterogeneous reactions ( e.g. nanoparticle
production) and most unit operations are scale-dependent.239
In other words, ‘‘ chemical rate constants are scale independent ,
but physical parameters are not .’’240
While scaling-up, a choice between batch or continuous
production has to be made. Batch processes are easy to designfrom bench-scale reactions, and are versatile and ﬂexible. Theease of scale-up using batch processing has been recentlydemonstrated in two examples of bioinspired materialssynthesis. In a recent conference, McAuliﬀe et al. reported a
scalable method for multi-gram scale production of enzyme
supported on silica using polyethyleneimine.
241Morse and
co-workers applied the principles of bioinspired synthesis tothe low temperature (16–80 1C) production of BaTiO
3in a
2 litre reactor (reaction time = 24 h to 10 d), where up to 250 gof nanomaterial could be produced (Fig. 10a).
242
It is known that batch processes pose diﬃculties in process
integration, suﬀer from low capacities, high capital costs andhigh down-times. Continuous processing, on the other hand,provides cheaper alternative and high capacities.
240The scale-up
of bioinspired silica synthesis was successfully demonstratedusing a continuous ﬂow tubular (a plug-ﬂow type) reactor
(Fig. 10b).
192This process displayed versatility when silica
production was tested with a range of additives and processingconditions (reagent concentrations, reaction times and ﬂowrates). Furthermore, the suitability of this approach for thepreparation of functional hybrid nanomaterials was evidentfrom the reported examples of quantum dots encapsulationor enzyme immobilisation.
192While the scale-up is currently
only limited to selected materials such as silica andBaTiO
3,192,242,243in view of the advances in bioinspired
synthesis of other nanomaterials232and the progress made incontinuous production of nanomaterials from non-bioinspired
methods (see ref. 1–10 in ref. 192), it is only a matter of timebefore we witness the scale-up of a range of functionalmaterials.
6. Summary
Through various strategies, researchers have found ways totransfer the biological secrets into synthetic approaches toinvent bioinspired silica technology (Fig. 11). Without theadvent of bioinspired silica synthesis, rapid and controlledsynthesis of silicas under mild conditions and without the needof non-aqueous co-solvents had been rarely possible. Itcan be appreciated that some of the important features ofbiosiliciﬁcation have been realised in bioinspired synthesiswhich include mild conditions and green synthesis, tailoringmaterials properties, and the ability to encapsulate foreign
materials. Such control has been only possible due to the
tremendous progress in the groundwork required for buildingfundamental understanding of silica-biomolecule systems asseen in the last decade.
More importantly, applications in areas ranging from
biomedical materials to sensors and composite materials havestarted to appear. Perhaps more exciting is the use of bio-siliciﬁcation knowledge to manipulate biological silica forma-tion or to develop non-silicate materials from non-biologicalelements for applications in optical and electronic materials.

One could argue that learning from biology, ‘green’ routes
to silica have been invented. If these advances are implementedin current industrial production of silica, large savings, in
addition to better control, could be achieved. Without any
doubts, the future of bioinspired silica research will be indemonstrating the versatility of this technology for generatingapplications that can make a signiﬁcant impact.
