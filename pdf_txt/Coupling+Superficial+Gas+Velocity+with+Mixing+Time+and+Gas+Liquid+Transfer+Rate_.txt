Mass transfer limitations in syngas fermentation processes are mostly attributed to poor solubility of CO
and H 2in water. Despite these assumed limitations, a syngas fermentation process has recently been
commercialized. Using large-sale external-loop gas-lift reactors (EL-GLR), CO-rich off-gases are converted
into ethanol, with high mass transfer performance (7–8.5 g.L-1.h/C01). However, when applying established
mass transfer correlations, a much poorer performance is predicted (0.3–2.7 g.L-1.h/C01). We developed a
CFD model, validated on pilot-scale data, to provide detailed insights on hydrodynamics and mass trans-
fer in a large-scale EL-GLR. As produced ethanol could increase gas hold-up (+30%) and decrease the bub-
ble diameter ( /C202 mm) compared to air–water mixtures, we found with our model that a high volumetric
mass transfer coefﬁcient (650–750 h/C01) and mass transfer capacity (7.5–8 g.L-1.h/C01) for CO are feasible.
Thus, the typical mass transfer limitations encountered in air–water systems can be alleviated in the
syngas-to-ethanol fermentation process./C2112022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http://

converted by microbes (predominantly Clostridium spp.) into a
range of chemicals, e.g. acetic acid, ethanol, acetone and iso-
propanol ( Teixeira et al., 2018 ). The company LanzaTech has been
able to commercialize the process of converting CO-rich off-gases
from steel-mills into ethanol. Currently they deploy ethanol pro-
duction facilities in China, while expanding their manufacturing
network to other countries ( Fackler et al., 2021; Köpke and
Simpson, 2020; Teixeira et al., 2018 ).
Details of the full-scale operation are unknown in the scientiﬁc
literature due to the proprietary nature of this process. It is
expected that syngas conversion takes place in a gas-lift reactor
with an external circulation loop ( Li et al., 2017 ). This reactor con-
ﬁguration, also known as the external loop gas-lift reactor (EL-GLR)
is like a conventional air-lift loop reactor as applied in waste-water
treatment and industrial bioprocesses. Compared to the more
established bubble column reactors (BCRs), in external-loop airlift
reactors (EL-ALRs) there is forced liquid recirculation (potentially
but not necessarily via pump action) through the downcomer
(the external-loop), causing high liquid velocities, a more deﬁned
(plug)ﬂow pattern and a shorter mixing time ( Chisti and Moo-
Young, 1987; Merchuk and Siegel, 1988 ). The external-loop might
also be used for heat exchange, introduction of fresh feed and broth
withdrawal ( Jakobsen, 2014 ).
The increased liquid velocity in the riser is known to decrease
the gas residence time and thus the gas hold-up ( eG) and the volu-
metric mass transfer coefﬁcient ( kLa) compared to a bubble column
(Verlaan et al., 1989b; Weiland and Onken, 1981 ). At the same
time, gas–liquid mass transfer is generally known to be one of
the limiting factors in syngas fermentation processes
(Asimakopoulos et al., 2018, Bredwell et al., 1999, Elisiário et al.
(2021), Klasson et al., 1991, Yasin et al., 2015 ). For industrial etha-nol production, it was determined that a kLaof at least 580 h/C01
should be reached for commercial success ( Köpke et al., 2011 ).
Our preliminary calculations, based on publicly available data
reported by LanzaTech, show that a mass transfer capacity ( MTC)
of 7 to 8.5 g.L-1.h/C01should be reached, which results in a kLa
between 600 and 750 h/C01, based on a headspace pressure of
1 bar and 50% CO in the inlet gas ( Figure S1 ).
For estimation of kLain air–water systems, many relationships
have been provided in the literature for different reactor types
(Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2009 ). With these relations the most
likely kLawas estimated at industrial conditions and compared to
thekLafrom our preliminary calculations ( Table 1 ), resulting into
aMTC between 0.3 and 2.7 g.L-1.h/C01. A clear discrepancy between
the kLaobtained by these relations and the supposed industrial
performance was found, as all engineering correlations predict a
substantially lower kLa. Although it is widely known that elec-
trolytes, organic molecules (such as the produced ethanol), bio-
mass, and the reactor geometry inﬂuence kLa(Garcia-Ochoa and
Gomez, 2009, Heijnen and Van’t Riet (1984) ), the impact of these
factors are not comprehensively considered with the correlations
inTable 1 . Furthermore, empirical relations obtained for ALRs were
derived at smaller scales and their validity for larger scales bears
uncertainties. The non-standard reactor geometry and irregular
ﬂow pattern in industrial reactors complicate the prediction of
the mass transfer performance using common correlations, which
are normally valid for a narrow range of conditions and were
derived in shorter columns (inﬂuencing uG,s) while assuming ideal
mixing. Spatio-temporal variations complicate the a priori estima-
tion of eG,kLaand MTC as particular geometry conﬁgurations
strongly inﬂuence the hydrodynamics in ALRs (e.g. riser width/
height, separator dimensions and the particular connection of theNomenclature

2downcomer). For example, while the liquid and gas velocities are
expected to be high in the riser, these should decrease in the wider
separator section in the top of the vessels and consequently
increase the local eG(Hernández-Calderón et al., 2017 ).
Several models have been developed to describe hydrodynam-
ics of pilot- and full-scale airlift bioreactors. The model by Van
der Lans (1985) predicted the axial mean values of liquid circula-
tion velocity and gas fraction in a pilot-scale external-loop bioreac-
tor well. Van Benthum et al. (1999) modelled three-phase
hydrodynamics (liquid velocity, gas and solid hold-up) in a bioﬁlm
airlift suspension extension reactor, wherein the liquid velocity in
a gas-free downcomer is controlled independently from the gasﬂow velocity. While neglecting spatial variations of gas, liquid
and solids concentrations in the internal regions, the model was
well able to predict the pilot-scale hydrodynamics. Earlier,
Heijnen et al. (1997) described the liquid circulation velocity and
gas hold-up in an industrial-scale bioﬁlm internal-loop airlift sus-
pension reactor, based on mass and momentum balances. This
model is applicable to three hydrodynamic regimes: gas-free
downcomer (regime 1), entrained gas in downcomer (regime 2)
and gas back-circulation via downcomer (regime 3). We argue that
in the LanzaTech case, operation in regime 1 or 2 may be preferred
compared to regime 3 as the latter could reduce the CO partial
pressure and thus its saturation concentration in the riser.
Convection-dispersion and tanks-in-series (1D) models have
been proposed to understand mixing and mass transfer phenom-ena in small-scale airlift reactors ( Znad et al., 2004 ), but it is
unclear how the ﬂow pattern deviates from these simple mixing
models for the large-scale EL-GLR. It is generally known that
large-scale BCRs show high axial dispersion coefﬁcients ( Heijnen
and Van’t Riet (1984) ) but that EL-ALRs studied at lab and pilot-
scale display more plug-ﬂow behaviour ( Verlaan et al., 1989b ).
As the axial dispersion behaviour is unclear in an industrial EL-
GLR, the convection–dispersion models turned out to be unsuitable
for the prediction of the large-scale ﬂow pattern and gas–liquid
mass transfer rates. Furthermore, several relations have been
developed to describe the mass transfer coefﬁcient k
L, based on
local conditions such as the slip velocity and the eddy dissipationrate ( Table 2 ). These relations require a high spatial resolution,
which cannot be provided by the 0D and 1D models.
With 3D computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) models a high
spatio-temporal resolution can be obtained, albeit with a much
greater computational effort than when applying simple mixing
models. For EL-ALRs, several authors used CFD to study the hydro-
dynamics and the mixing behaviour ( Karcz et al., 2013; Moudoud
et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2006 ). Hydrodynamics and oxygen mass
transfer in a lab-scale sectionalized EL-ALR has been studied
recently; it was demonstrated that the k
Lapredicted with Equa-
tion 5 ( Table 2 ) matched the experimental data better than predic-
tions from Equation 1 and 3 ( Teli and Mathpati, 2021 ). Similar
work was done earlier, wherein it was observed that Equation 3
strikingly showed a good agreement with experimental results

lower) for CO due to its lower diffusion coefﬁcient compared to oxygen ( Van Hecke et al., 2019 ).

3(Dhanasekharan et al., 2005 ). Most of these models were devel-
oped for lab and pilot-scale EL-ALRs, with riser diameters smaller
than 0.14 m, where wall effects can be signiﬁcant ( Chisti and
Moo-Young, 1987 ).
A CFD model for syngas fermentation in a BCR with a population
balance model for the gas phase was developed recently ( Siebler
et al., 2019 ). Low kLavalues and thus low CO transfer rates, low dis-
solved CO concentrations and low CO uptake rates were obtained
as >50% of the bubbles had a relatively high bubble diameter ( db>8 -
mm). Several one-dimensional (1D) models have been presented
for syngas fermentation in large-scale BCRs as well. De Medeiros
et al. (2020) developed such a model for the optimization of differ-
ent process conditions. They determined that strategies needed to
be obtained to enhance the kLawith at least a factor three, relative
to air–water correlations, to decrease the minimum ethanol sellingprice to $0.7/L and reach high (70%) thermodynamic efﬁciency.
Another BCR model was coupled with a black-box stoichiometric
model for C. autoethanogenum based on thermodynamics in order
to estimate the ethanol productivity in such a reactor. High pro-
ductivities were obtained (4.25 g
EtOH.L-1.h/C01), but this was at the
expense of the gas utilization (only 17%) as high gas ﬂow rates
were used ( Benalcázar et al., 2020 ). In another 1D model, with
kinetics reported by LanzaTech, a genome-scale metabolic model
for a proprietary C. autoethanogenum strain was coupled to bubble
column hydrodynamics. In their model kLaand microbial CO
uptake rate varied axially between 350 and 425 h/C01and 0 and
7 g.L-1.h/C01, respectively, by assuming dbbelow 1.5 mm and con-
stant kLof 1/C110-4m.s/C01(Li et al., 2019 ). However, detailed analyses
how the low dband high MTC could be accomplished in industrial
reactors are lacking.
Thus far, no CFD model has been developed for describing the
hydrodynamics and CO mass transfer in a large-scale external-
loop gas-lift reactor, for studying the required conditions to mini-
mize the gas–liquid mass transfer limitations in an industrial syn-
gas fermentation process. Next to that, the results of such a model
would provide information to be used for subsequent reactor
design and optimization. The model that we have developed in this
study for hydrodynamics and mass transfer in an EL-ALR was ﬁrst
tested and validated by comparing local axial gas and liquid ﬂow
velocities in the riser and the downcomer, gas hold-up, and turbu-
lence intensity with pilot-scale results obtained by Young et al.
(1991) . Then, using the same model equations, the large-scale
EL-GLR hydrodynamics and gas transfer were simulated and com-
pared with correlations and observations from literature. For vary-
ing bubble diameters (between 1 and 7 mm), higher temperatures
and gas hold-up, and a range of headspace pressures, kLaand MTC
were determined using different relations ( Table 2 ), in order to
establish the best operation window for high industrialperformance.
2. Methods
2.1. Reactor geometry and mesh
In this work, two reactor geometries were considered: A pilot-
scale geometry to compare CFD model predictions with experi-
mental results and a full-scale reactor for the subsequent mass
transfer study. The hydrodynamic CFD model was applied to data
obtained by Young et al. (1991) for a pilot-scale external-loop reac-
tor (2.95 m high, riser and downcomer diameter of 19 and 14 cm,
260 L reactor volume, 160 L liquid volume). This reactor conﬁgura-
tion was chosen as it was found that the gas hold-up was indepen-
dent of the riser diameter when wider than 14 cm ( Chisti and Moo-
Young, 1987 ). The 3D geometry was developed using ANSYS
Design Modeller. A polyhedral mesh (400000 cells, 0.27 minimumorthogonal quality) with a higher resolution in the dispersed-phase
domain was developed in ANSYS Meshing ( Figure S2 ).
The dimensions of the industrial-scale reactor were estimated
from openly available pictures of the Shougang-LanzaTech plant,
and are schematically represented in Fig. 1 . The 3D geometry has
been developed using cylindrical bodies, with a ring sparger
(Young et al., 1991 ) mounted at 0.1 m above the reactor base.
The total volume of the reactor equals 840 m
3, with an ungassed
liquid volume of 565 m3, which roughly corresponds to the
500 m3volume presented by LanzaTech ( Fackler et al., 2021 ). A
mesh with 370,000 polyhedral cells, 0.3 minimum orthogonal
quality, 20 cm cell size and three reﬁned boundary layers near
all walls (including sparger), was constructed in Fluent Meshing.
A mesh reﬁnement study done using meshes with 1.6 and 1.9 mil-
lion cells established that the 370000-cell mesh was sufﬁcient fordetermining k
Laand MTC within 10% accuracy ( Figure S2 ,Table S3 ).
2.2. Fluid dynamic model
The transient gas–liquid ﬂow was computed within ANSYS Flu-
ent 2020R1 with the Eulerian multiphase ﬂow model, with implicit
volume fraction formulation, dispersed RNG k-eturbulence model,
which is the recommended choice for bubble column modelling
(Laborde-Boutet et al., 2009 ), and standard wall functions. The
forces involved in the two-phase interaction were surface tension
(continuum surface force), drag (Fluent’s universal-drag model)
and gravity. A model with a similar set of forces was used before
for syngas fermentation modelling in BCRs ( Siebler et al., 2019 ).
In the pilot-scale ALR, mean air bubble diameters ranged from 4
to 6 mm ( Young et al., 1991 ), therefore as dispersed phase 5 mm
bubbles were modelled. For the large-scale reactor, the mean bub-
ble diameter is unknown and could range between 1 and 7 mm,
based on the liquid properties and operating conditions ( Heijnen
and Van’t Riet (1984) ). Because coalescence inhibition can be
expected due to the salt and ethanol-rich fermentation broth,
3 mm bubbles were modelled in the large-scale hydrodynamic
model, according to Krevelen and Hoftijzer (1950) , by assuming a
sparger oriﬁce size of 0.75 mm.
A mass-ﬂow inlet was used on the sparger surface at the bottom
of the reactor, providing a ﬁxed mass ﬂow rate of gas ( Table 3 ). A
pressure-outlet with gas backﬂow was assumed at the top of the
column, with the headspace pressure of 101 kPa in both reactors.
Sensitivity analyses were done with 304 kPa and 608 kPa head-
space pressure for the large-scale reactor. Boundary conditions
considered a turbulence intensity of 5% and the local vessel diam-
eter. To all the walls standard no-slip conditions were assigned.
As the precise liquid medium properties are unknown due to
the presence of variable concentrations of cells and ethanol, theproperties of water at 25 /C176C were assumed for the liquid phase
(Table 4 ). Gas density differences were accounted for using the
ideal gas law. Both reactor models contained a gas headspace, by
initializing the headspace gas fraction to be 1.
2.3. Mass transfer
The mass transfer studies in the large-scale bioreactor were
performed after a statistically stationary (‘‘steady”) ﬂow ﬁeld was
established (after 1000 s simulation time, using 3 mm bubbles).
For an additional 200 s, dynamic ﬂow data was exported every sec-
ond for time-averaging and processed in Tecplot 360 EX 2018 R1.
Based on the computed ﬂow ﬁeld, k
Laand MTC were calculated
via six different relations for kL(Table 2 ). Spherical bubbles were
assumed because of the small bubble diameter and bubble-
stabilizing effects of dissolved solutes (Equation (7)) as well as a
linear gradient in axial gas phase CO mole fraction yCO(considering
90% CO conversion ( Figure S1 )) (Equation (8)). The impact of theL. Puiman, B. Abrahamson, Rob G.J.M. van der Lans et al. Chemical Engineering Science 259 (2022) 117770
4bubble size was studied in the 1–7 mm range. The inﬂuence of the
operating temperature was considered as it affects the liquid vis-
cosity, CO diffusion coefﬁcient and Henry constant ( Table 5 ). For
the calculation of MTC, microbial CO uptake kinetics are not
required, instead a dissolved CO concentration of 0 g.L-1was
assumed in all grid cells.

The transient models were solved using ANSYS Fluent 2020R1.
For the pilot-scale models, a time step of 0.01 s was used with a
maximum of 30 iterations per time step, wherein the residuals
decreased to O(10/C03). The results presented here were obtained
by storing ﬂow data at the positions mentioned by Young et al.
(1991) every 0.01 s, starting at 50 s (when a steady ﬂow ﬁeld
was reached) until 110 s ﬂow time.
For the industrial reactor, the time step dtwas gradually
increased from an initial 0.01 s until 0.65 s, dt= 0.025 s until 3 s,
dt= 0.05 s until 5 s and dt= 0.1 s from 5 s on. This time-stepping
strategy was required to keep solution convergence (residu-
als < O(10/C03)) within 10–25 iterations per time step, and found
to be crucial to achieving convergence near the mesh-reﬁned spar-
ger location. The solution methods, spatial discretization and relax-
ation factors for both reactor models are given in Table S4 .
3. Results and discussion
In this section, the ﬂow pattern predicted by the CFD model will
ﬁrst be compared with the pilot-scale data obtained by Young et al.
(1991) (section 3.1). After this, the results at the large-scale are dis-
cussed (section 3.2) in terms of the gas hold-up, ﬂow pattern and
hydrodynamic regime. Then, results on mass transfer and strate-
gies for relieving the gas–liquid mass transfer limitations will be

3.1. Pilot-scale ﬂow pattern
The computed liquid velocity in the riser was compared with
the velocity proﬁles along the radius obtained experimentallybyYoung et al. (1991) (Fig. 2 ). The computed mean liquid velocity
in the riser approximates the measured one with maximum devi-
ations of 36% ( Table S5 ). However, the computed velocity gradi-
ents along the column radius were consistently smaller (i.e.
ﬂatter velocity proﬁles) than those measured (i.e. showing usually
a sharp maximum at the axis at r/R= 0). The radial proﬁles of the
turbulence intensities in both the riser and downcomer are quiteTable 4

6similar to the data, but the model underestimates the turbulence
intensity in the riser, while overestimating in the downcomer.
This is probably a result of the simpliﬁed set of forces considered
in the model. Roy et al. (2006) were able to model the radial liq-
uid velocity proﬁle by using the standard k-emodel and taking
the turbulence dispersion and lift forces into account, together
with a conveniently chosen bubble size. On the other hand, liquid
velocity measurement errors up to 10% for the riser were noted
from a liquid phase mass balance by Young et al. (1991) , which
could possibly explain part of the deviation between model and
measurements. The (gas-free) downcomer velocity proﬁle, how-
ever, showed good correspondence, as well as the proﬁles pre-
dicted for the gas hold-up and gas velocity. The trends for
increasing superﬁcial gas velocities were modelled correctly for
all variables.
Furthermore, by simulated injection of a liquid tracer (with the
same properties as water) just above the sparger, it was deter-
mined that the model can predict the typical circulating liquid
mixing behaviour as often shown in airlift reactors ( Chisti and
Moo-Young, 1987; Voncken et al., 1964 ). The tracer concentration
proﬁle over time ctextracted from the CFD simulations was nor-
malized with the ﬁnal (steady state) concentration ct,1. This nor-
malized tracer concentration over time ( t) was ﬁtted with
Equation (9)(Chisti and Moo-Young, 1987 ) expressing the ﬂuctua-
tions of concentration over a normalized time h(h=t/tc, with tcthe
circulation time), as function of the Bodenstein number
(Bo¼uL;axLc=Dax,with Lcthe circulation length and Daxthe axial
dispersion coefﬁcient).

In this way, Boand tcfor the EL-ALR were determined at sev-
eral locations in the reactor ( Fig. 3 ). The model predicted Boval-
ues around 45, which are typical estimations for Boin an ALR
(Verlaan et al., 1989c, Verlaan et al. 1989a ), indicating the dom-
inance of the plug-ﬂow in the reactor. A mean circulation time
of about 7.6 s resulted from the tracer model with a uG,sof
8.4 cm.s/C01.
Considering that most of the ﬂow parameters were determined
to be within a 25% range of experimental values ( Table S5 ) and the
good correspondence with mixing theory, we considered the
model appropriate for engineering calculations. Furthermore, the
most important variable concerning mass transfer, the gas hold-
up, was reasonably well predicted. In order to be sure that the
radial liquid velocity proﬁle is properly predicted it will be com-
pared with theoretical predictions for this proﬁle in large-scale
EL-ALRs in the upcoming section.3.2. Large-scale ﬂow pattern
In this section, the results of the large-scale reactor CFD model
are presented. First, its ability to predict the gas fraction is dis-
cussed, since this is a key variable regarding mass transfer. Then
the gas and liquid velocity-ﬁelds are analysed in detail. Lastly,
the radial proﬁles of the liquid velocity in the riser and the
observed time-variations are discussed.
The simulated gas hold-up in the EL-GLR was on average 0.13 at
a superﬁcial gas velocity of 2.8 cm.s/C01. This value was in good
agreement with the values obtained from several correlations
available in literature for BCRs and EL-ALRs ( Table 6 ).
The local values of the instantaneous gas hold-up ( Fig. 4 a) were
averaged in time over 200 s ( Fig. 4 c). The CFD simulations indicate
that at the bottom of the reactor, the freshly sparged gas is stronglypushed towards the wall of the riser, which might result in bubble
coalescence, by the liquid exiting the downcomer. This is also vis-
ible in the liquid ﬂow patterns ( Fig. 4 b, d). When the gas is pushed
towards the left side, the local liquid velocity increases, creating a
circulation loop around the downcomer outlet. Similar behaviour
has been observed experimentally for bottom-plate spargers
(Chisti and Moo-Young, 1987 ) and also from CFD models devel-
oped for different EL-ALRs ( Roy et al., 2006 ).
Halfway the riser the instantaneous gas hold-up shows an
asymmetric distribution ( Fig. 4 a), while the time-averaged gas
hold-up ( Fig. 4 c) is more symmetrical with high values along the
riser axis, indicating an oscillating gas plume. This is also apparent
from the velocity plots, with liquid moving back and forth between
the sides ( Fig. 4 b). Such oscillating behaviour has been observed
experimentally in internal-loop airlift reactors ( Ziegenhein et al.,
2016 ). However, by time-averaging these movements cancelled-
out and a quasi-symmetric velocity proﬁle was obtained
(Fig. 4 d). While the liquid mostly rises, the negative values
observed near the riser wall indicate a certain degree of backmix-
ing, which has also been observed experimentally in ALRs
(Merchuk and Siegel, 1988; Zhang et al., 2019 ). This internal liquid
recirculation contributes to the overall mixing in the riser and cre-
ates axial and radial dispersion.
Approaching the gas–liquid separator at the top of the riser, the
gas hold-up tends to increase as gas expansion (decreasing hydro-
static pressure) and the wider separator diameter (decreasing the
local liquid velocity) increase the gas residence time. This particu-
lar section of the reactor could become advantageous for mass
transfer because the expected lower CO saturation concentration
(due to the lower hydrostatic pressure and a lower CO fraction in
the gas) can be compensated by the increase in gas hold-up.
Just above and in the downcomer inlet, high gas hold-ups as
well as high liquid ﬂow velocities were predicted. While the liquid

CFD data have been obtained at uG,sof 8.4 cm.s/C01.L. Puiman, B. Abrahamson, Rob G.J.M. van der Lans et al. Chemical Engineering Science 259 (2022) 117770
7ﬂow is directed horizontally and downwards, the bubbles dragged
into the downcomer will rise. This causes a sharp separation
between gas and liquid and consequently high gas hold-ups. Sim-
ilar behaviour was found by modelling EL-ALRs with comparable
geometry ( Dhanasekharan et al., 2005; Karcz et al., 2013;
Moudoud et al., 2018 ). Degassing geometries might prevent the
gas to ﬂow into the downcomer ( Heijnen et al., 1991 ). At the left
side of the downcomer, the drag by the liquid and buoyancy of
the gas bubbles are in equilibrium and therefore a stable gas
hold-up is obtained over time ( Fig. 4 c). This corresponds to the sec-
ond gas entrainment regime ( Heijnen et al., 1997 ), wherein the gas
bubbles entrained in the downcomer do not reach the bottom andonly partially ﬁll the downcomer. Higher local gas hold-up in the
downcomer close to the riser wall was also observed in internal-
loop airlift reactors ( Choi and Lee, 1990 ).
The question emerges on how high the recirculation through
the downcomer is in the EL-GLR compared with the internal recir-
culation in the riser. From the velocity ﬁeld it was determined that,
in this particular reactor geometry, about 14% of the liquid goes
down via the downcomer and ﬂows downwards near the riser
walls. This indicates that axial mixing in the riser is signiﬁcant
and plug-ﬂow behaviour cannot be assumed for the liquid phase.
Although the downcomer appears to be poorly used for the liquid
circulation in the studied operation regime, it clearly increases the
liquid ﬂowrates in the riser compared to a bubble column (with
zero net axial liquid velocity). Such results highlight the added
value of CFD predictions as this behaviour could not be predicted
with simpler (1D) models.
In the pilot-scale model, a parabolic velocity proﬁle was not
observed ( Fig. 2 ) and further radial liquid ﬂow was not determined,
therefore the large-scale model needed to simulate local axial and
radial velocity variations. At several heights in the riser, the proﬁle
of axial liquid velocity along the whole riser diameter was calcu-
lated over time, then compared with a parabolic proﬁle (Equation
(10),Fig. 5 ) characteristic for BCRs and ALRs ( Menzel et al., 1985 ).
Both parameters of the parabolic proﬁles, velocity at the riser axis
u
L,ax(r= 0) and superﬁcial liquid velocity uL,s,ax, were taken from
time-averaged CFD results.

þuL;s;ax ð10ÞAt the lower locations (5.1 m and 7.4 m) the liquid velocity pro-
ﬁle is skewed towards the left side, due to the liquid entering from
the downcomer. However, the liquid velocity proﬁle shifts towards
the central axis at higher locations in the riser, where it matches
the proposed parabolic proﬁle. It should be noted that there are
large time-variations, which should be taken into account when
analysing mass transfer in EL-GLRs, for example by time-
averaging for 200 s ( Figure S3 ).
Many phenomena found at pilot-scale were also predicted by
the simulations to occur in the large-scale external-loop reactor.
Moreover, the predicted overall gas hold-up and liquid ﬂow veloc-
ities showed a good match with literature relations. From all these
indicators it can be concluded that with a CFD model the large-
scale behaviour can be described properly. With this hydrody-
namic model, subsequent calculations on kLaand MTC will be per-
formed and are discussed in the next section.
3.3. Mass transfer
Syngas fermentation processes are developed towards a multi-
tude of products, e.g. acids (acetic acid), alcohols (ethanol, propa-
nol, butanol), ketones (acetone), glycols (2,3-butanediol),
aromatics, dienes, esters and terpenes ( Köpke and Simpson,
2020 ). Although the literature is very scarce on their inﬂuence on
mass transfer in fermentation broths, it is known that the hydro-
philic products inhibit bubble coalescence in water, thereby
decreasing the Sauter mean bubble diameter ( d32)(Keitel and
Onken, 1982 ), and increasing kLa(Zlokarnik, 1980 ). In a pilot-
scale bubble column (3 m high, 20 cm width), Keitel and Onken
(1982) found decreases in d32from 4 to 1 mm and doubling of eG
from 2 to 4%, for a variety of alcohols. By increasing hydrophobic
chain length, stronger effects (i.e. occurring at lower concentra-
tions) were reported, for d32,eG, and kLa(Keitel and Onken, 1982;
Zlokarnik, 1980 ). Similar results (<1 mm bubbles and highly
increased eG) in tall bubble columns were obtained with ethanol
(Besagni et al., 2016; Jamialahmadi and Müller-Steinhagen, 1992;
Oels et al., 1976; Rollbusch et al., 2015 ), while Krishna et al.
(2000) found that the ethanol stabilizes the homogeneous ﬂow
regime (i.e. bubbly ﬂow at higher uG,s). In ALRs, however, organics
increased eGup to a modest 30% ( Azher et al., 2005; Kojic ´et al.,
2015 ). The smaller inﬂuence of organics on eGin ALRs compared
to BCRs was explained by, amongst others, the higher velocities
of the axial liquid ﬂow ( Weiland and Onken, 1981 ). The expected
ethanol concentration in the LanzaTech reactor (50 g.L-1)(Köpke
et al., 2011 ) is much higher than the minimum concentrations
for coalescence inhibition (1–10 g.L-1)(Keitel and Onken, 1982 ).
Therefore, we can assume a low d32(optimistic scenario: about
1 mm; pessimistic scenario: 3 mm) in the scenario with ethanol,whereas scale-independent d
32between 5 and 7 mm are observed
in BCRs with air–water mixtures ( Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2009;
Heijnen and Van’t Riet (1984); Maximiano Raimundo et al., 2019 ).
Likewise, it may be assumed that the produced ethanol could
increase the local gas hold-up by at least 30% compared to solu-
tions without ethanol.
Furthermore, temperature dependencies of the physical proper-
ties show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the mass transfer. By operating
at a temperature of 37 /C176C,kLais estimated to be around 1.44 times
higher than at 20 /C176C(Heijnen and Van’t Riet (1984) ), mainly due to
an increased CO diffusion coefﬁcient (+150%) and decreased liquid
kinematic viscosity (-45%). However, the effect of this elevated
temperature will be counteracted by a lower CO solubility through
its Henry coefﬁcient (-28%), which in turn negatively inﬂuences the
MTC. The net effect of a higher temperature, however, will still be
positive.
Thus, for different models describing kL(Table 2 ), the impact of
the bubble diameter (varied between 1 and 7 mm) and the mutualTable 6

9impact of increased hold-up and temperature were examined
(Fig. 6 ). It was found that with a bubble diameter of 3 mm, most
correlations predicted kLaand MTC lower than those required by
the process ( Figure S1 ), even with an increased hold-up and tem-
perature. However, with 2 mm bubbles, sufﬁcient kLaand MTC
were predicted using the relations from Higbie (1935) and
Kaštánek (1977) . In addition, when including hold-up and temper-
ature effects with 2 mm bubbles, also the relations from
Calderbank and Moo-Young (1961) and Linek et al. (2005) led to
adequate kLaand MTC. If the bubble diameter would be 5 to
7 mm, which is expected for air–water mixtures in industrial BCRs
(Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2009; Heijnen and Van’t Riet (1984) ),
then all correlations predict insufﬁcient kLaand MTC, causing mass
transfer limitations. These values correspond with the values fromTable 1 , stressing the validity of these relations in air–water
dispersions.
From this sensitivity analysis we can conclude that industrial-
scale syngas fermentation in the EL-GLR requires small bubble
diameters ( /C202 mm), which should be obtained in combination
with a high gas-hold up at 37 /C176C. Ethanol presence promotes these
conditions, while in air–water conditions (5 to 7 mm bubbles) themass transfer limitations would not be alleviated. Therefore, our
results indicate that in an industrial syngas fermentation process
towards bubble-stabilizing products, e.g. ethanol, the typical mass
transfer limitations that are present in air–water systems can sig-
niﬁcantly be alleviated.
It is noted that there are large differences among the k
Lavalues
predicted using the different kL-relations. The relations based on

10eddy energy dissipation rate (4–6) predict lower values than the
bubble-based relations (1–2). The deviations with relations 1 and
2 could be due to underestimation of eby the k-eturbulence model
(Gimbun et al., 2009 ). Accounting for this with a scaling factor,
based on the overall minimum power input ( Kuschel and Takors,
2020; Roels and Heijnen, 1980 ), would result in a 22% increase in
kLa. Moreover, it has been noted that relation 3 has a too high pro-
portionality constant ( Kawase and Moo-Young, 1990 ) compared to
the similar relations 4–6. Generally, sensitivity analyses with dif-
ferent kL-relations should be done in future modelling work on
gas–liquid mass transfer. Experiments in EL-ALRs could determine
which relation describes kLthe best in the speciﬁc reactor and how
the produced ethanol and the higher temperature would inﬂuence
thekLa.
In some cases the kLawas predicted to be sufﬁcient, while the
MTC was not (e.g. relations 4 and 5). This indicates that the
ideal-mixing assumption ( Figure S1 ) may not hold and, instead,
thelocal values of kLaand solubility should be taken into consider-
ation when computing MTC. Although high kLavalues were
obtained at certain locations (such as in the separator), the contri-
bution of these volumes to the overall mass transfer rate was found
to be low because of the decreased CO saturation concertation
(Fig. 7 ). However, the high kLaat the reactor top could be beneﬁcial
for CO depletion such that the off-gas only contains residual
amounts of CO. As LanzaTech patented a method with the aim of,
amongst others, increasing mass transfer in the headspace via a
so-called ‘showerhead’ ( Li et al., 2017 ), it is expected that these
local high kLavalues at the top of the reactor are indeed required
for maximizing gas conversion. Although signiﬁcant CO mass
transfer was predicted in the downcomer, when microbial con-
sumption takes place, only marginal transfer is expected as the rel-
ative volume of the downcomer is small and as the EL-GLR is
operated in the second hydrodynamic regime.
High pressure fermentation has been mentioned as a promising
strategy to increase the mass transfer rate of poorly soluble gases
(Van Hecke et al., 2019 ). Patents indicate that in lab experiments
with higher operating pressures (304 and 608 kPa) increased etha-nol titre and productivity was obtained ( Gaddy et al., 2001;
Simpson et al., 2008 ). However, in the scientiﬁc literature, no ben-
eﬁcial effect was found on the productivity, while C. ljungdahlii ’s
product spectrum shifted from acetate and ethanol towards for-
mate at increased pressures ( Oswald et al., 2018 ). Inhibitory effects
were observed for CO with an inhibition constant of 60 kPa
(Mohammadi et al., 2014 ), so that increased pressures could
decrease the CO consumption rate. The gas saturation concentra-
tion increases proportionally with the pressure (Equation (7)),
but the gas hold-up would decrease (ideal gas law) with a constant
gas (mass) ﬂow rate. In order to study these opposing phenomena,
the effect of increasing the headspace pressure on the kLaand MTC
was investigated by running CFD simulations with 304 and
608 kPa headspace pressure.
It was observed that increased headspace pressures decrease
the kLasigniﬁcantly ( Fig. 8 ). This is due to the decrease in gas
hold-up, which decreased from 0.13 to 0.054 and 0.033, at 304
and 608 kPa respectively. Similar values of MTC at increased pres-
sure were observed when it was calculated using the relations of
Higbie (1935) and Calderbank and Moo-Young (1961) , while a
slight decrease was observed with the eddy-based equation. Thus,
the decrease in gas hold-up was neutralized by the solubility-
increase. One should note that the compressor power requirement
(Van Hecke et al., 2019 ) increases sharply for increased headspace
pressures.
At elevated pressures, one could increase the gas mass ﬂow rate
linearly with pressure to obtain a constant superﬁcial gas velocity
and thus kLa, without changing the hydrodynamic regime. In our
study, the mass ﬂow rate was assumed constant at 2.11 kg.s/C01,
causing decreasing superﬁcial gas velocities and hold-up at ele-
vated pressured. As is it expected that LanzaTech operates six reac-
tors to produce in total 48 kt.a-1ethanol ( Figure S1 ), a higher gas
mass ﬂow rate at higher pressures was not likely. If the gas ﬂow
rate would be increased proportionally with pressure (to obtain
constant kLa), a near-linear relationship between MTC and the
compressor power requirement is obtained ( Figure S4 ), making
operating at overpressures an economical choice. Moreover, con-

at high dissolved CO concentrations ( de Medeiros et al., 2020 ), we
would not recommend operation at higher pressures.
3.4. Outlook
The hydrodynamics and gas–liquid mass transfer in an
industrial-scale reactor for the conversion of CO-rich steel-mill
off-gases by syngas fermentation were studied by computational
ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). Simulation results indicated that conditions
could be reached for industrially-sufﬁcient speciﬁc mass transfer
rates ( kLa) and mass transfer capacities ( MTC). High MTC was found
possible when the operating temperature is 37 /C176C and by produc-
ing ethanol, which inhibits bubble coalescence to maintain rela-
tively small bubbles ( db/C202 mm), and increases riser gas hold-up
(/C2430%). We recognize that other factors (e.g. particular medium
components or process engineering strategies) might also be
deployed to obtain such mass transfer capacities. Since most of
thekLarelations from literature ( Table 1 ) were derived in air–wa-
ter systems, without considering any enhancing effects, further
research is needed on the development of mass transfer correla-
tions representing real fermentation conditions. Especially, these
relations should consider the presence of bubble-stabilizing com-
pounds such as ethanol, acetone, and acetic acid, as well as thepresence of salts, antifoam agents and microbial biomass. The
addition of ﬁne particles (e.g. kieselguhr, silica) can also increase
k
Lasubstantially ( Schumpe et al., 1987 ), possibly by minimizing
bubble coalescence ( Vazirizadeh et al., 2016 ), and could be
included in such relations, which are pertinent for the develop-
ment of more realistic CFD and process models.
The two-phase ﬂow pattern in the large-scale reactor was found
to be very dynamic, with large variations in the movement of a gas
plume. As the local values of the gas solubility and kLadetermine
MTC, the high spatio-temporal resolution that can be obtained
via CFD was necessary for predicting the reactor performance
and for determination of the main factors inﬂuencing mass trans-
fer. Since the main limitation of CFD is its high computational
demand, further research should focus on the development of
coarse-grained computational models (such as compartment mod-
els) to determine kLaand MTC in a faster way and as function of
several variables such as the gas ﬂow rate, media composition (en-
hancement agents), pressure and reactor scale and geometry.The strong dynamics of the computed ﬂow patterns in the
large-scale reactor will determine the trajectories of microorgan-
isms performing the syngas conversion. Consequently, the
microorganisms would experience peaks and valleys in dissolved
CO concentrations in an irregular fashion. By implementing CO-
uptake kinetics, CO concentration proﬁles can be obtained for thedifferent operating conditions. Euler-Lagrangian simulations can
then reveal what conditions microbes experience over time (‘lifeli-
nes’) and how that would inﬂuence their (dynamic) behaviour
(Lapin et al., 2004 ). Coupling the ﬂow ﬁeld with a metabolic model
ofC. autoethanogenum could reveal the inﬂuence of these dynamic
conditions on the bioprocess performance and (by)product spec-
trum and guide the development of scale-down simulators and
optimized reactor geometries ( Haringa et al., 2018 ).
To develop an optimal bioreactor, spatial homogenization of
mass transfer is imperative ( Köpke et al., 2011 ), requiring high
k
Lain zones with lower solubility (e.g., separator section) and
low kLain zones with high solubility (e.g., lower riser section). Con-
trolling the liquid ﬂow rate in the riser, which determines the riser
gas hold-up, could be done to ﬁne-tune the local mass transfer
capacity. Reducing the liquid backmixing could for example be
accomplished by adding internal surfaces, such as perforated
plates ( Merchuk and Siegel, 1988 ), which would additionally pro-
mote local bubble-break up ( Teli and Mathpati, 2021 ), or by
increasing the resistance in the downcomer ( Merchuk and Stein,
1981; Weiland and Onken, 1981 ) by decreasing its diameter or
adding a pump, to force the ﬂow at the optimal rate. By decreasing
the liquid ﬂow rate in the riser, the riser gas hold-up can be
increased, possibly leading to an increased mass transfer capacity.
As this may increase the mixing time ( Verlaan et al., 1989c ), one
should balance the impact of the mass transfer time with the liquid
mixing time when designing large-scale EL-GLRs. Using the down-
comer, the liquid velocity and thus the gas velocity and hold-up
can be adjusted, which cannot be done in a bubble column. The
downcomer can also be used for product removal towards the dis-
tillation section, inﬂow of fresh medium or nutrients, heat transfer,
and as source for supplying the showerhead ( Li et al., 2017 ).
Alternatively, by positioning the sparger above the downcomer
inlet, the gas ﬂow could be better distributed in the riser ( Chisti
and Moo-Young, 1987 ). In this case, less bubble coalescence is
expected as the gas is less likely to be pushed towards the wall
opposite to the downcomer. Although the CO solubility is larger
in the riser bottom, the higher sparger position would lead to a

12CO-depleted zone below the sparger, which decreases the overall
mass transfer capacity. CFD simulations with a sparger above the
downcomer inlet conﬁrm a 4–6% decrease in MTC, due to the low
gas hold-up below the sparger ( Figure S5 ,Table S6 ). Further
research on the sparger position and how the downcomer (and
its position) inﬂuence bubble coalescence in ethanol-rich media
could be helpful for designing industrial-scale EL-GLRs with higher
productivity.
In this study, all the CO transferred to the liquid phase was
assumed to be instantaneously consumed by the microbes. In prac-
tice, there will be CO dissolved in the liquid phase, thus decreasing
the driving force of the mass transfer. The dissolved CO concentra-
tion is determined not only by the local ﬂow conditions and mass
transfer rates, but also by the local microbial CO uptake rate, gov-
erned by the uptake kinetics (especially the afﬁnity). The literatureis very scarce on studies of CO uptake kinetics by Clostridia (e.g.
Mohammadi et al. (2014) ). Detailed CO uptake kinetics using dis-
solved CO concentration measurements should be developed with
priority.
Many authors ( Elisiário et al., 2021; Klasson et al., 1991; Yasin
et al., 2015 ) explain the low mass transfer capacity obtained in
syngas fermentation partly by the low solubility of CO. Solubility
can also be affected by the ethanol fraction in the solution, and this
effect has been mostly studied for O
2dissolution. Shchukarev and
Tolmacheva (1968) determined little impact of ethanol on the O 2
solubility in the water–ethanol mixture for ethanol mole fractions
below 0.2. Therefore, it is not expected that the CO solubility would
be affected by the produced ethanol in the studied reactor condi-
tions (50 g.L-1ethanol or mole fraction /C240.02 ( Köpke et al.,
2011 )). Since O 2and CO have comparable Henry coefﬁcients at
37/C176C (9.6 /C110-6and 8.2 /C110-6mol.m/C03
.Pa/C01, respectively ( Sander,
2015 )) and the CO fraction in syngas is often higher than the O 2frac-
tion in air, we argue that the challenges that have to be addressed in
aeration processes should be faced in syngas fermentation as well.
Instead of attributing the poor performance to the solubility,
research should focus on ways to enhance kLain the bioreactor,
e.g. by the presence of organic products.
Promising processes for the conversion of syngas towards other
products, such as fatty acids ( Diender et al., 2016 ), acetone, iso-
propanol and 2,3-butanediol ( Köpke and Simpson, 2020 ) have been
developed. For successful commercialization of such processes, one
could beneﬁt a lot if the produced products are mass transfer-
enhancing, like ethanol, or even better.
4. Conclusion
With a CFD model, which was validated using published data
from a pilot-scale reactor, we investigated the hydrodynamics of
a large-scale external-loop gas-lift reactor. With this model, the
gas–liquid mass transfer was studied for an industrial CO-to-
ethanol fermentation process. Several relations describing the
mass transfer coefﬁcient were evaluated and kLaand mass transfer
capacity were computed for varying process conditions.
At an operating temperature of 37 /C176C, with increased gas hold-
up compared to air–water and smaller bubbles ( /C202 mm instead of
5 to 7 mm), most available mass transfer relations predicted sufﬁ-
cient kLaand MTC for an industrially viable syngas fermentation
process, in line with data published by LanzaTech. We argue that
this is possible since the produced ethanol inhibits bubble coales-
cence, causing smaller bubbles and increased gas hold-up. This
indicates that typical mass transfer limitations encountered in
air–water systems can be alleviated under industrial syngas fer-
mentation conditions.
In spite of being computationally intensive, CFD can also be
used for determining high-resolution process conditions that couldnot be accurately computed using simpler models. The developed
hydrodynamic and mass transfer model can be used to advance
research into reactor design for industrial syngas fermentation,
for determination of the microbial response in such reactors using
Euler-Lagrange modelling, and the development of scale-down
simulators operated in a representative window.
