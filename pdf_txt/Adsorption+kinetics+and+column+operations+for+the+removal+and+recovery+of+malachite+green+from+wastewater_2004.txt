Abstract In the present study, Juglans regia shells were
used to prepare activated carbon by acid treatment method.
J.regia shell-based activated carbon was used for the
adsorption of two synthetic dyes namely, a basic dye mal-
achite green and an acid dye amido black 10B. The prepared
adsorbent was crushed and sieved to three different meshsizes 100, 600 and 1,000 lm. The adsorbent was charac-
terized by scanning electron microscopy, surface acidity
and zero-point charge. Batch experiments were carried outby varying the parameters like initial aqueous phase pH,
adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration. The equi-
librium data were tested with Langmuir, Freundlich,Redlich–Peterson and Sips isotherm at three different
temperatures 293, 300 and 313 K and it was found that the
Freundlich isotherm best ﬁtted the adsorption of both thedyes. Kinetic data were tested with pseudo ﬁrst-order model
and pseudo second-order model. The mechanism for the
adsorption of both the dyes onto the adsorbent was studiedby ﬁtting the kinetic data with intraparticle diffusion model
and Boyd plot. External mass transfer was found to be the
rate-determining step. Based on the ionic nature of the
adsorbates, the extent of ﬁlm diffusion and intraparticle
diffusion varied; both being system speciﬁc. Thermody-namic parameters were also calculated. Finally, the process
parameters of each adsorption system were compared to
develop the understanding of the best suitable system.Keywords Adsorption /C1Malachite green /C1Amido black /C1

Introduction
Underground water is the major source of drinking water.
This underground water is being polluted by the wastewater
containing a large number of contaminants like acids, bases,
toxic organics, inorganics, heavy metals (Repo et al. 2010 ),
dissolved solids and colors disposed by leather and textile
industries. Out of all such contaminants, color is the most
visible pollutant and the presence of very minute quantitymakes it undesirable for use. Some of the dyes are toxic,
stable and non-biodegradable (Gupta et al. 2004 ). Thus, the
removal of color from dye-bearing efﬂuents becomes amajor challenge due to the difﬁculty in treating such
wastewaters by conventional treatment methods such as
chemical and biological oxidation methods (Vadivelan andVasanth kumar 2005 ). However, adsorption technique
proved to be an efﬁcient and economical process for the
treatment of these dye-bearing efﬂuents. But the efﬁciencyof the process lies in choosing the suitable adsorbent. The
chosen adsorbent should be easily available, cheap and
should have no economic value. For the past two decades, alarge variety of waste materials particularly from industrial
and agricultural waste products, whose disposal has been a
problem, have been successfully utilized as adsorbents fortreating the industrial efﬂuents (Bhatnagar and Sillanpaa
2010 ). Some common waste materials used for this purpose
include rubber seed coat (Rengaraj et al. 2002 ), pecan shells
(Shawabke et al. 2002 ), jute ﬁber (Senthilkumaar et al.
2005 ), Indian rosewood sawdust (Garg et al. 2004 ), olive
stones (El-Sheikh et al. 2004 ), pine wood (Tsenga et al.
2003 ), coir pith (Namasivayam and Kavitha 2002 ), rice

The present study is the thriving effort to utilize an
agricultural waste biomass Juglans regia shell as adsor-
bent. J. regia is mainly used in food industries and its shell
is thrown out as a waste product which is of no economicalvalue. In the present study, this J. regia shells were car-
bonized and the activated carbon prepared from J. regia
shells (JSAC) was used for the adsorption of two dyes
namely malachite green (MG) and amido black 10B (AB).
MG is a basic dye whereas, AB is an acid dye. The sig-niﬁcance of this study is to discuss the variation in mech-
anism of the adsorption processes based on the ionic nature
of the adsorbates. This study was carried out from Jan,2011 to May, 2011 at Central Leather Research Institute
(CSIR-CLRI), Adyar, Chennai, India.
Materials and methods
Preparation of JSAC
J. regia shells used in the present study were procured from
small scale food industries in Chennai, India and were
crushed into small pieces. The crushed shells were washed
with deionized water until all the leachable impurities wereremoved. Then the materials were dried in sunlight for 48 h
to remove moisture. The dried shells were carbonized by
treating with concentrated H
2SO4(1:1 ratio) for 48 h. The
carbonized J. regia shells were then washed with water
until it became neutralized. Then the neutralized activated
carbon was dried in a hot air oven at 140 /C176C for 48 h. The
dried J. regia shell-based activated carbon (JSAC) was
then crushed and sieved to three mesh sizes (100, 600 and
1,000 lm).
Characterization of activated carbon
The zero-point charge of the prepared activated carbon was
determined by solid addition technique (Balistrieri and
Murray 1981 ). The surface functionality of JSAC was
evaluated by Boehm titration method (Boehm 1966 ) and
the surface morphology of JSAC was studied by scanning
electron microscope.
Preparation of adsorbate solutions
MG (C 52H54N4O12) and AB 10B (C 4OH 28N7NaO 13S4)
were purchased from M/s. s.d. ﬁne chemicals and used
without further puriﬁcation. The stock solution (1,000 mg/L)of the dyes was prepared by dissolving accurately
weighed amount of the dyes in distilled water. Allworking solutions of the desired concentrations were
prepared by diluting the stock solutions with distilled
water.
Analytical measurements
Unknown concentrations of the dyes were determined by
ﬁnding out the absorbance at the characteristic wave-
length using a double beam UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV-2102 PC). Standard calibration charts were
prepared by measuring the absorbance of different dye
concentrations at ( kmax) 619 nm for AB and 655 nm for
MG and unknown concentrations of dyes before and after
adsorption were computed from the calibration charts. The
pH of the aqueous solutions was measured by DigisunElectronics System (Digital pH meter model 2001). Sur-
face morphology of the activated carbon was studied by
SEM of Hitachi make (model S-3400N).
Equilibrium experiments
Adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out by
varying the initial concentrations of dyes as 1, 10, 15, 25,
50, 100, 250, 500, 700 and 1,000 mg/L. The requiredamount of the adsorbent was added and the solutions were
agitated for 24 h at 100 rpm at 300 K. The same experi-
mental procedures were repeated at 293 and 313 K.

Kinetic experiments
The kinetics of adsorption of dyes onto JSAC was carried
out by withdrawing and analyzing the samples at the timeinterval of every 5 min for the ﬁrst 30 min and later at
every 10 min until the consecutive residual dye concen-
trations became closer. The kinetic experiments were car-ried out separately for four different initial dye
concentrations such as 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/L for all the
three particle sizes at 300 K.232 Int. J. Environ. Sci. Technol. (2013) 10:231–242

Results and discussions
Characterization of the adsorbent
The surface acidity of JSAC was determined by Boehm
titration method and the total surface acidity was calculated
as 0.3503 meq g-1with the maximum composition of
phenolic group (0.270871 meq g-1), with traces of lactonic
(0.0321 meq g-1) and carboxylic (0.0473 meq g-1)
groups. The zero-point charge (pH zpc) was found to occur
at pH 2.5. The surface morphology of the JSAC was
studied by SEM and the images were displayed in Fig. 1.
From these micrographs, pores and scale like structures areevident on the surface of the prepared activated carbon.Inﬂuence of initial pH
The adsorption of MG and AB onto JSAC were studied at
different pH varying from 2.3 to 10.5 for all three particle
sizes (100, 600 and 1,000 lm). It was found that the
maximum adsorption occurred at pH 6–7 for MG and at pH
2.3 for AB dye. The surface of the adsorbent will be
negatively charged above pH
zpcand positively charged
below pH zpc(2.5) (Preethi and Sivasamy 2006 ). At low pH,
MG will get protonated as –N?(CH 3)2, and H?ions from
the acidic solution compete with the positively charged dyemolecules thus inhibiting the adsorption process. But, at
pH range between 6 and 7, the H
?ions from the aqueous
solution decreased and hence favouring the adsorption ofprotonated MG dyes onto the negatively charged adsorbent
surface. Similar result was reported elsewhere by Hameed
and El-Khaiary ( 2008 ). In case of azo dye AB, if the
electrostatic interaction was the only step involved in the
adsorption process, then, the % adsorption would have
been maximum at pH ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 where theadsorbent surface will be negatively charged and the dye
will be protonated as –SO
3H. But in the observed process,
JSAC might have interacted with the dye moleculesthrough hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic–hydrophobic
mechanisms as reported elsewhere by Al-Degs et al. ( 2008 ).

JSACInt. J. Environ. Sci. Technol. (2013) 10:231–242 233
123Hence the adsorption of AB onto JSAC was maximum at
pH 2.3. But the maximum % adsorption was observed to be
higher for MG than AB.
Inﬂuence of adsorbent dosage
Effect of variation of mass of JSAC was studied by
increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0.001/10 to
0.5 g/10 mL for all the three particle sizes. The results
showed that % adsorption of both dyes, either basic or acid,
increased with the increase in the adsorbent dosage. The
increase in adsorbent dosage appeared to promote moreactive sites, which facilitates the adsorption of dyes.
However, for the adsorption of MG, the % adsorption
decreased after certain point. This may be due to thedecrease in total adsorption surface area available to MG
resulting from overlapping or aggregation of adsorption
sites (Zhang et al. 2008 ). It was found that 3 g/L of JSAC
adsorbed 100 % of 25 mg/L of MG whereas the
same amount of JSAC could adsorb only around 90 % of
25 mg/L of AB. Since JSAC was acid treated, it containedmore acidic functional groups on its surface. The basic dye
MG had a good afﬁnity toward the acidic adsorbent surface
when compared to the acid dye AB. Hence the % adsorp-tion of MG was higher than AB.
Effect of initial dye concentration at different
temperatures
The effect of initial dye concentrations was studied for both
the dyes by varying the dye concentrations as 1, 10, 15, 25,
50, 100, 250, 500, 700 and 1,000 mg/L at different tem-
peratures 293, 300 and 313 K and the result suggested thatthe % adsorption decreased with the increase in initial dye
concentrations for both the dyes. Furthermore, adsorption
increased with an increase in temperature for both the dyes,indicating that the processes were endothermic.
Adsorption equilibrium
To optimize the design of the adsorption processes, it is
important to establish the most appropriate correlationfor the equilibrium curves. Various isotherms such as
Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Redlich–Peterson isotherms
had been used to evaluate the equilibrium characteristicsof the adsorption processes. The parameters of the iso-
therm equations were calculated by linear regression
analysis. The calculated adsorption parameters and thecorrelation coefﬁcient ( r
2) for all the isotherms at 293, 300
and 313 K for all the three particle sizes of JSAC for the
adsorption of MG and AB onto JSAC are summarized inTables 1,2.Langmuir isotherm
The Langmuir equation is applicable to homogeneous
adsorption where the adsorption of each adsorbate mole-
cule on to the surface has equal sorption activation energy.The linear form of this isotherm is represented by the
expression (Langmuir 1916 ):
1
qe¼1
qmKLCeþ1
qmð3Þ
where qe(mg/g) and Ce(mg/L) are the amount of adsorbed
adsorbate per unit weight of adsorbent and unadsorbedadsorbate concentration in solution at equilibrium,
respectively. The constant K
L(L/g) is the Langmuir equi-
librium constant and qmis the theoretical monolayer
saturation capacity.
The essential feature of the Langmuir isotherm can be
expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant calledseparation factor ( R
L, also called equilibrium parameter)
which is deﬁned by the following equation:
RL¼1
1þKLC0ð4Þ
where C0(mg/L) is the initial adsorbate concentration.
The value of RLindicates the shape of the isotherms to be
either unfavorable ( RL[1), linear ( RL=1), favorable
(0\RL\1) or irreversible ( RL=0).
The equilibrium data for the adsorption of both the dyes
at all three temperatures for all the three particle sizes (100,
600 and 1,000 lm) were ﬁtted with the Langmuir isotherm.
It can be inferred from Table 1that the monolayer satu-
ration capacity ( qm) and the Langmuir constant ( KL)
increased with the increase in temperature (Mittal 2006 )
and decreased with the increase in the particle sizes of the
adsorbent (Patil et al. 2011 ). It can also be found that the
values of qmandKLwere higher for the adsorption of MG
than AB. This was because; values of qmand KLare
directly proportional to % adsorption. Since decrease inthe particle size of the adsorbent and the increase in tem-
perature favors % adsorption, the values of q
mand KL
increased. It was also found that the separation factor ( RL)
was between 0 and 1 for both the dyes for all the three
particle sizes indicating that the adsorption processes were
favorable.
Freundlich isotherm
The most important multisite adsorption isotherm for het-
erogeneous surfaces is the Freundlich adsorption isotherm
and the linear form of this isotherm is expressed as(Freundlich 1906 ):

Freundlich exponent. Therefore, a plot of log qeversus log
Ceenables the constant and exponent n to be determined.
Freundlich isotherm was tested for both the dyes at the
three temperatures for all the three adsorbent particle sizes.From Table 1, it was found that the Freundlich exponent
(n) and Freundlich constant ( K
F) increased with the increase
in temperature and decrease in the adsorbent particle sizes.It was also inferred that the values of nandK
Fwere higher
for the adsorption of MG than AB. Here the value of nwas
between 1 and 10 which again proved that the processes arefavorable at all the temperature for all three particle sizes.

Freundlich isotherms and can be derived using either equi-librium or thermodynamic approach (Repo et al. 2011a ).

Adsorption data of both the dyes onto JSAC were tested
with Sips isotherm and the parameters obtained are givenin Table 2. The Sips isotherm constants increased with the

123JSAC. Redlich–Peterson isotherm constants also varied in
the same fashion as that of the Sips isotherm constants. The
parameters for Redlich–Peterson isotherm for all the three
particle sizes at three temperatures are given in Table 2.
By testing with both the isotherm models, it can be
inferred that the value of separation factor ( RL) fell
between 0 and 1 and the value of the Freundlich exponent(n) from the Freundlich isotherm was between 1 and 10
which proved that the conducted adsorption processes were
favorable. Both these adsorption processes followed the
Freundlich isotherm since the r
2values were closer. Fur-
ther Redlich–Peterson and Sips isotherm constants ( nRP
and nS) also conﬁrmed that the surface of the prepared
adsorbent was heterogeneous in nature.
Adsorption kinetics
The kinetic studies were carried out by withdrawing and
analyzing the samples at the time interval of every 5 min
for the ﬁrst 30 min and later at every 10 min until the
consecutive residual dye concentrations became closer.The kinetic data for the adsorption of MG and AB onto
JSAC of three different particle sizes with the four initial
dye concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/L) were tested
with the well-known kinetic models namely pseudo ﬁrst-order model and pseudo second-order model. The mecha-
nism of the adsorption processes were studied by plotting
the data with intraparticle diffusion model and Boydplot. The parameters of these kinetic models are given in
Table 3.

123As seen from Table 3, the pseudo ﬁrst-order rate con-
stant k1increased with the decrease in the dye concentra-
tions (Abechi et al. 2011 ) and decreased with the increase
in particle size of the adsorbent (Ho and McKay 1988 ) for
both the studied adsorption processes. It was also evident
that there was a considerable difference between calculated
qevalues and the experimental qe. The values of k1were
found to be slightly higher for the adsorption of MG
than AB.
Pseudo second-order equation
The sorption kinetics can also be described by pseudo
second-order model. The linear form of pseudo second-
order equation is expressed as (Bulut and Ozacar 2008 ).
t
qt¼1
k2q2
eþ1
qet ð9Þ
where k2(g/mg min) is the equilibrium rate constant of
pseudo second-order adsorption. Equation ( 9) does not
have the problem of assigning an effective qe. If the pseudo
second-order kinetic equation is applicable, the plot of t/qt
against tshould give a linear relationship, from which qe
andk2can be determined from the slope and intercept of
the plot.
From Table 3, it was clear that the pseudo second-order
constant k2decreased with the increase in the dye con-
centration and also increased with the decrease in particlesize of the adsorbent for both the adsorption processes.
From this table it can also be found that the calculated q
e
values were on par with the experimental qevalues for both
the observed processes unlike the pseudo ﬁrst-order equa-
tion. But the value of k2was found to vary in the same
fashion as the value of k1of pseudo ﬁrst-order model.
Intraparticle diffusion model
The intraparticle diffusion equation is given as (Cheung
et al. 2007 ):
qt¼kit1
2þc ð10Þ
where qtis the amount of solute on the surface of the
sorbent at time t(mg/g) and kiis the intraparticle diffusion
rate constant (mg/g min1/2). When intraparticle diffusion
alone is the rate limiting step, then the plot of qtversus t1/2
passes through the origin. When ﬁlm diffusion is also
taking place then the intercept is C, which gives the idea on
the thickness of the boundary layer.
From the intraparticle diffusion plots shown in Figs. 2
and3, it was evident that the adsorption processes followed
two steps. The ﬁrst linear portion followed the boundarylayer diffusion followed by another linear portion which
represents the intra particle diffusion. This shows that theadsorption processes were not only by intraparticle diffu-
sion but the ﬁlm diffusion also played a role in both the
observed processes (Vasanth kumar et al. 2005 ).
Boyd plot
The Boyd plot predicts the actual slow step involved in the
adsorption process. The Boyd kinetic expression is given
by (Vadivelan and Vasanth kumar 2005 )
F¼1/C0ð6=p22ðÞ2Þexpð/C0B
tÞð 11Þ
and
F¼qt=q0 ð12Þ
where q0is the amount of adsorbates adsorbed at inﬁnite
time (mg /g) and qtrepresents the amount of dyes adsorbed
at any time t(min), Frepresents the fraction of solute
adsorbed at any time t,andBtis a mathematical function
ofF.
Substituting Eq. 10in Eq. 9,
1/C0F¼ð6=p24ðÞ2Þexpð/C0BtÞð 13Þ
or
Bt¼/C00:4977 /C0lnð1/C0FÞð 14Þ
The Btvalues at different contact times can be
calculated using Eq. ( 14) for various time intervals. The
calculated Btvalues were plotted against time t.
The Boyd plots are shown in Figs. 4and 5for the
adsorption of MG and AB onto JSAC, respectively. From
these ﬁgures, it was clear that the plots were linear for boththe adsorbates at all the studied adsorbate concentrations.
Though r
2values of both pseudo ﬁrst-order equation and
pseudo second-order equation lie closer to unity, the
Fig. 2 Intraparticle diffusion model for the adsorption of MG onto
JSAC for 100 lm (ads. dosage =1.5 g/150 ml; pH 6.87; T=300 K;
agitation =150 rpm)238 Int. J. Environ. Sci. Technol. (2013) 10:231–242
123calculated qevalues of the pseudo ﬁrst-order equation were
not in par with the experimental qevalues. But, in case of
pseudo second-order equation, the calculated qevalues are
in par with the experimental qevalues. So, it is clear from
the accuracy of the model that the adsorption of both the
dyes followed pseudo second-order chemical reaction. It
was already demonstrated that the pseudo second-orderkinetic equation for adsorption is much similar to the
universal rate law for a chemical reaction (Liu 2008 ). Since
the processes followed the pseudo second-order equation, it
literally suggests that the adsorption is mainly by simple
chemical reaction between the dye molecules and thesurface functional groups on JSAC. Since JSAC was acidactivated, there may be the presence of some irremovable
acid groups on the surface which might have been involved
in bonding with the basic dye (MG) molecules which maynot be that signiﬁcant in case of acid dye (AB) molecules.
The plots of the intraparticle diffusion did not pass
through the origin indicating that the adsorption processesnot only followed the intraparticle diffusion but the ﬁlm
diffusion also played an important role in both the studied
adsorption processes. It was also in coincidence with the factthat the processes followed the pseudo second-order model.
The fact that ﬁlm diffusion also played a major role in the
studied adsorption processes suggested that the adsorptionwas mainly by covalent bonding by the surface acidic
functional groups. Also, the Boyd plots suggested that the
rate-determining step is the external mass transfer since theplots were linear and does not pass through the origin.
Comparison of mechanisms of adsorption of acid dye
and basic dye onto JSAC
In general, the mechanism for dye removal by adsorption
on a sorbent material may be assumed to involve the fol-
lowing four steps (Cheung et al. 2007 ): (1) migration of
dye from bulk of the solution to the surface of the adsor-bent (bulk diffusion); (2) diffusion of dye through the
boundary layer to the surface of the adsorbent (ﬁlm dif-
fusion); (3) transport of the dye from the surface to the
interior pores of the particle (intraparticle diffusion or pore
diffusion); (4) adsorption of dye at an active site on thesurface of material (chemical reaction via ion-exchange,
complexation and/or chelation).
The dye sorption is governed usually by either the liquid
phase mass transport rate or the intraparticle mass transport
rate. Hence diffusive mass transfer is incorporated into the
adsorption process. In diffusion studies, the rate can be

123expressed in terms of the square root time. The mathe-
matical dependence of qtversus t1/2is obtained if the
process is considered to be inﬂuenced by diffusion in the
particles and convective diffusion in the solution.
But from Figs. 2and3, it was evident that the plots did
not pass through the origin, this is indicative of some
degree of boundary layer control and these further showsthat the intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate control-
ling step, but other processes may also control the rate of
adsorption. From Fig. 2, for the adsorption of basic dye,
MG onto JSAC, one can clearly witness that diffusive mass
transfer (ﬁrst linear portion of the curve) occurred up to thet
1/2of 3.8 min which is followed by intraparticle diffusion
(second linear portion of the curve). But in case of Fig. 3,
for the adsorption of acid dye, AB onto JSAC, the diffusivemass transfer occurred up to the t
1/2of around 6 min. This
suggests that since MG is a basic dye, a sort of chemical
reaction occurred between the cationic dye molecules andnegatively charged adsorbent surfaces with the aid of the
irremovable acidic functional groups in the observed pH.
Whereas, since AB is an anionic dye, there is not muchintraparticle diffusion due to the presence of some acidic
functional groups on the surface of JSAC and hence the %
adsorption also decreased considerably for the adsorptionof acid dye onto acid-activated carbon when compared to
the basic dye.
It is important to ﬁnd the slowest step which is the rate-
determining step. It was proved by the Boyd plot that
external mass transfer is the rate-determining step for both
the adsorbates. But the extent of ﬁlm diffusion andintraparticle diffusion varied based on the ionic nature of
the adsorbates.
Thermodynamic properties
Thermodynamic parameters which include Gibbs free
energy change ( DG), enthalpy change ( DH) and entropy
change ( DS) were calculated using Langmuir constant ( K
L).Thermodynamic parameters obtained are shown in
Table 4. From this table, it was evident that the adsorptions
of both the dyes were endothermic since the value of DHis
positive. Irrespective of the nature of the dyes, the studiedadsorption processes were endothermic. Similar results
for endothermic adsorption were also observed on
adsorption on bentonite (Mall et al. 2005 ), activated carbon
prepared from deoiled soya (Onal et al. 2006 ), activated
carbon prepared from Tuncbilek lignite (Mittal 2006 ) and
hen feathers (Mall et al. 2005 ). The positive value of
DSshowed the increased randomness of the adsorbate
molecules on the solid surfaces than in the solution for bothacid and basic dyes. The adsorption of MG was feasible
and spontaneous at all the three temperatures for the
adsorbent particle sizes of 100 and 600 lm and only at
313 K for 1,000 lm adsorbent particles. However, in the
case of AB, it was feasible and spontaneous only for
100lm particle size of the adsorbent at 300 and 313 K.
The adsorption of AB was not feasible at lower tempera-
ture and larger adsorbent particles. Hence the thermody-
namic studies too suggest that the adsorption of the basicdye, MG onto the acid-activated JSAC was well feasible
compared to the acid dye, AB.
Conclusion
Adsorption studies had been carried out for the removal of
Malachite Green (MG) dye and Amido Black 10B (AB)
dye by acid-activated carbons derived from J. regia shells
(JSAC). The % adsorption of MG dye was maximum at the
pH ranging from 6 to 8 whereas for AB dye, it was
maximum at pH 2.3. Equilibrium data were tested withLangmuir and Freundlich isotherm model equations.
Adsorption of both the dyes followed Freundlich isotherm
and hence the prepared activated carbons had heteroge-neous surfaces. This heterogeneity was also conﬁrmed
by the constants of Redlich–Peterson and Sips isotherms.Table 4 Thermodynamic parameters

123The favorability of the studied adsorption processes were
proved by the separation factor ( RL) of the Langmuir iso-
therm and the Freundlich exponent ( n) of the Freundlich
isotherm. The kinetic data were tested with pseudo ﬁrst-order and pseudo second-order models. It was concluded
that the adsorption of both the dyes followed the pseudo
second-order kinetics. The nature and the mechanism of theadsorption processes were studied by employing intrapar-
ticle diffusion model and Boyd plot. External mass transfer
was the rate-determining step for the adsorption of both the
adsorbates. The adsorption is not only by intraparticle dif-
fusion but the ﬁlm diffusion also played an important rolefor all three particle sizes with varying initial dye concen-
trations. The extent of ﬁlm diffusion and intraparticle dif-
fusion depended on the ionic state of the adsorbates.Thermodynamic analyses showed that both the processes
were endothermic in nature and there were increased ran-
domness of the adsorbate molecules on the solid surfacesthan in the solution. It was also found that the adsorption of
MG dye was much more an efﬁcient process than the
adsorption of AB dye onto JSAC. This may be due to thereason that since JSAC is acid activated; there may be
the presence of some irremovable acid groups on the sur-
face of JSAC which would have been involved in formationof covalent bond with the basic dye molecules effectively
when compared to the acid dye molecules. The fact that the
studied adsorption processes were not only by intraparticlediffusion but the ﬁlm diffusion also played an important
role also suggests the same. From this study, it can be
concluded that the acid-activated carbon can be effectivelyused for the adsorption of basic dyes when compared to the
acid dyes. These J. regia shells literally of no economical
value, proved to have a great potential in environmentalremediation processes.
