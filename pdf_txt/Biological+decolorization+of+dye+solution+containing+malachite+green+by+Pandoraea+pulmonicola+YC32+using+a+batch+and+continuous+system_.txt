 ABSTRACT  
Malachite green is a textile dye that has long been used in aquaculture as an 
antiprotozoal and ant ifungal agent.  It is basic in nature and its chloride and oxalate forms 
are readily soluble in water . The dye is mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and 
impedes plant growth  severely .  Stenotrophomonas koreensis was isolated from a textile 
effluent and e mployed to biologically degrade the recalcitrant toxic dye malachite green. 
Chromatographic and Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the degradation of the dye. In 
the absence of any supplements or media, S.koreensis decolorized 98 % malachite green 
in 4h. The highest  degradation of up to 98.78 % was obtained at pH 6, temperature 45 ⁰C 
and inoculum size 6.36 ml using RSM w ithin one hour. 98.6% decolorization was 
achieved within 2.5 h of the addition of soymeal extract or peptone. The strain also 
decolorized the azo dye methyl orange up to 96%. S.koreensis was immobilized into 
reusable  PVA -sodium alginate beads to facilitate easier handling, which showed 95 .49% 
decolorization. One of the most promising features of this strain is that even in the 
presence of heavy metals, S.koreensis actively degraded the dye. S.koreensis biodegraded 
malachite green following the first -order reaction kinetics. The enzymes responsible for 
the malachite green degradation were tyrosinase, malachite green reductase, and NADH -
DCIP reductase. Several and detailed ecotoxicological studies were performed in 
compl iance with Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) 
guidelines to ensure that the products obtained after the bio -degradation were safe for 
release in the ecosystem. Aquatic toxicity was estimated by exposing photosynthetic 
cyanobacter ia Anabaena flos -aque , small crustacean zooplankton Daphnia magna , 
floating aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor and zebrafish Danio rerio to the dye and the 
degradation  product. Since malachite green can also potentially contaminate land 
through aquaculture run -offs, textile and  tannery effl uents; some important land 
organisms were also tested for toxicity. Beneficial soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis and 
Bacillus pumilus , earthworm Eisenia fetida , important crop plants Triticum aestivum and 
Lens culinaris and mod el vertebrate Mus musculus were also exp osed to the dye and the 
degradation  product to evaluate the reduction of toxicity after the bacterial dye 
degradation process. Genotoxicity of dye and degradation  product was evaluated using 
root tip cells of Allium cepa . MTT assays of malachite green and its biodegraded product 
were conducted using Human cell lines HaCat and HepG2. Res ults indicated that the 
degradation  product was significantly safer than malachite green. Remazol Brilliant Blue    
5 
 R (RBBR), a common pr ecursor of other dyes and a toxic organo -pollutant, is an 
extensively used anthraquinone dye in the textile industry. In this study, bioadsorption of 
RBBR by the bacterial strain Bacillus rigiliprofundi was investigated. The effects of 
various physical par ameters on dye adsorption were studied. The kinetics and isotherm 
of adsorption were analysed. The bacterial adsorbent was characterized by Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). 
Phytotoxicity and cytotoxicit y was evaluated before and after the adsorptive removal of 
the dye. Upto 80% RBBR was adsorbed and removed by the bacteria in ten days. The 
optimum conditions for biosorption were pH 5.5, adsorbent dosage 30mg, initial dye 
concentration 25 mg/L and tempera ture 40ºC. The adsorption followed pseudo -first order 
kinetics and fitted appropriately to the Langmuir model. This is the first report on 
adsorptive decolorisation of the highly recalcitrant RBBR by the strain Bacillus 
rigiliprofundi .

 GENERAL INTRODUCTION  
Colors play a significant role in our everyday lives, and dyes have found their use from 
fabric to food since t ime immemorial. In ancient times, natural dyes were made from 
flowers, fruits, and lichens. From the latter half of the nineteenth century, toxic synthetic 
dyes started being manufactured since they generated huge revenues  and were easier to 
manufacture [ Nagendrappa, G., 2010] . In recent times, synthetic dyes cover most of all 
dyes and are relentlessly and unnecessarily used, from coloring fancy cakes to regular 
medicines. When dyes come in contact with the eyes or skin, they can cause serious 
injury. If i ngested through food, and dyes can cause harm indirectly. Industries that use 
dyes, like textiles, tanneries, or printing presses, let out effluents loaded with untreated 
concentrated dyes. These toxic dyes initially affect aquatic life but eventually reac h all 
other strata of the environment. Dyes are one of the major harmful components of 
effluents of several different industries [ Lellis et al., 2019 ]. Leather, textile, printing, 
food processing are the most rigorous users of dyes [Slama et al., 2021] and  also some of 
the greatest contributors of coloured effluents. Every passing day new dyes are 
synthesized and marketed for commercial use. Coloured wastewater when let out in 
waterbodies surrounding these industries causes exponential environmental deterio ration 
[Sarayu and Sandhya 2012]. Since light penetration is obstructed by coloured discharges, 
it hinders the photosynthesis of aquatic plants [Pandey et al., 2017]. Dyes can broadly be 
divided into these classes according to KirkOthmer, (1984): Acid dyes , basic dyes, direct 
dyes, fluorescent dyes, reactive dyes, sulphurous dyes, vat dyes and dye -precursors. In 
recent times, dyes are more familiarly classified according to the Colour Index published 
by the Society of Dyers and Colourists . Not only are ther e different types of dyes, but the 
dying process itself varies, like exhaust dying, continuous dying, printing etc. [Clark, 
2021]. Pollution caused by dyes is one of the most serious concerns in the present day 
scenario. Effluents containing dyes from indu stries, especially leather, textile and 
printing industries, when let out into the water bodies cause hindrance in photosynthesis 
of the aquatic flora, damaging the water ecosystem. Around 10% of the industrial dyes 
used, enters the ecosystem through these  effluents [Zollinger, 1987] annually discharging 
over 50,000 tons of dye, consisting toxic substances, into the environment [Tan et al., 
2018]. Throughout the last decade, the continuous rise in the use of reactive dyes has 
been witnessed, mainly due to t he increased utilization of cellulose fibers in the textile    
8 
 industry [ Benkhaya et al., 2020 ]. Most of the dyes, currently used are synthetic 
xenobiotics, having conjugated molecules and doesn’t get easily degraded [ Unuofin et 
al., 2019 ]. For the removal of  dyes, biosorption is an emerging approach [Elgarahy et al., 
2021]. Effluents loaded with dyes can be efficiently treated with activated carbon, but 
activated carbon being considerably costly, is not a commercially feasible option [Kumar 
et al., 2016]. Som e dyes even resist biodegradation by conventional activated sludge 
treatments [Ceretta et al., 2021]. A few techniques like chemical precipitation, 
electrocoagulation, elimination by adsorption etc. are currently in use. But these 
techniques are also mostl y incapable of completely eliminating the toxic colorants. 
Instead, they just transform them from one form to another, which may again be toxic 
leading to requirement of further treatment [ Amin et al., 2020 ].  Methods like 
flocculation, ozonation, photo -oxidation, froth floatation, ion exchange etc. are less 
efficient in terms of cost, quality, applicability and may produce wastes which are not 
environmentally safe to dispose [Rajasulochana and Preethy, 2016]. Sometimes, 
conjugated approaches are employed f or obtaining better results in terms of quality and 
time [Ledakowicz and Paździor, 2021]. Biological treatment methods for elimination of 
dye, are advantageous over modern physical and chemical techniques in terms of 
efficiency, cost effectiveness, low -maintenance, etc.  Biodecolorisation, or the biological 
removal of color or dye from wastewater, can be accomplished through one of the two 
processes: adsorption or degradation. This study attempts to curate, utilize, and provide 
some fundamental information r egarding two such microorganism that can degrade or 
adsorb and overcome the toxicity of dyes in industrial effluents.  
REVIEW OF LITERATURE  
Of all the major life -forms that has been on the face of earth, mankind has been here for 
the shortest span of time, but the damage they have caused is incredible and outrageous. 
Almost  everything that humans do, from sustenance to pleasure, from production of food 
crops to  manufacturing  air-conditioners or life -saving  drugs, there is potential to cause 
pollution.  Additi on of colors can make the dull look bright, the old look new and the 
unattractive look  attractive. Synthetic dyes which are mostly used to serve this purpose 
pose extreme levels of  toxicity  to the  environment.  The industries  which  use dye in their 
products , generate  a huge  amount  of dye-loaded  wastewater. Nearly 200,000 tons of dyes 
are let out into the environment through effluents  annually as a result of low adsorption    
9 
 of the dyes onto the dying materials due to inefficient  dying techniques [Andrade -Guel et 
al., 2021]. Remediation of dye -pollution by bacteria has  been  thoroughly  studied  since  the 
process  is efficient  and cost effective  [Mohapatra  et al., 2020;  Desai  et al., 2020; Chen  et 
al., 2021]. Malachite  green  is a highly  toxic  and recalcitrant  triphe nylmethane  dye used in 
a wide  array  of industries.  Apart  from  its use as a traditional colorant  of fabric,  leather,  
and paper,  it is used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent in aquaculture. Due to its 
easy availability and low cost,  it is even applied  to green vegetables to make them appear 
fresher. Malachite green can be  attributed to numerous health hazards. Developmental 
abnormalities, mutations, and cancers  result from prolonged exposure to the dye 
[Srivastava et al. 2004]. Numerous toxicological  investigations of the dye have revealed 
that it can irritate test mammals' eyes and mucous  membranes [Sudova et al., 2007]. It is 
also, a tested mutagen [Mittelstaedt et al., 2004].  However, several world agencies that 
work for pollution control have made i t mandatory to  remediate  the dye-containing  
effluents  before  being  released  outside.  Malachite  green  has   a complex  structure  that 
allows  it to withstand  sunlight,  biological  activity,  and various  degradative  
environmental  conditions,  making  it resistant  to degradation. The  dye's  recalcitrant 
nature allows it to circumvent standard wastewater treatment techniques, allowing  it to 
persist in t he environment [Barapatre & Jha 2020].  
It is widely acknowledged that  biological remediation is a better alternative t han 
chemical or physical treatments, mainly  because of the secondary pollutants generated by 
the latter two. Decolorization of malachite  green has been studied by many authors 
previously. Jasińska et al, (2012) decolorized 97.4%  of the dye with Myrothecium 
roridum IM 6482 in 96 h. Du et al. (2011) reported 90 -97% degradation of malachite 
green by Pseudomonas sp. strain DY1 in 24h. Laccase e nzyme from  the Trichoderma  
asperellum  strain  demonstrated  excellent  malachite  green  degradation  (97.18%) in 98.58 
minutes [Shanmugam et al., 2017].  A comprehensive compilation on  previously reported 
strains degrading malachite green is presented in Table 1 . S.koreensis till now had 
remained untapped for its potential to degrade malachite green. The bacterium was  first 
reported from compost near Daejeon city in South Korea [Yang et al. 2006]. Another  
strain, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, was isolated from so il contaminated with effluent 
from  a wine industry. Extracellular laccase was produced by this strain and resulted in 
partial  decolorization of certain dyes like methylene blue (53%), methyl green (71%), 
methyl orange  (48%) in 48hr [Galai et al. 2009]. It is often seen that industries that use    
10 
 dyes let out heavy  metals through their effluents. Since chromium is used extensively in 
chrome -tanning leather  and is required for collagen cross -linking, tannery effluents are 
high in hazardous hexavalent  chromium. Apart from chromium, run -offs from leather -
processing industries also contain  other heavy metals like cadmium, cobalt, lead, arsenic, 
nickel, selenium, etc. [Lofrano et al.  2016].  Production  of color  pigments  requires  heavy  
metals  like lead,  chromium,  cadm ium, etc. [Halimoon & Yin 2010]. Hence effluents from 
textiles also contain significant concentrations  of these  heavy  metals.  Bacteria  are 
vulnerable  to heavy  metals.  Their  presence  in the medium inhibits bacterial growth. 
Earlier, heavy metals were used a s antimicrobial agents [Hobman &  Crossman 2015]. 
Studies have consistently shown that metals in general, including heavy  metals,  are 
highly effective against  bacteria that form biofilms  [Teitzel & Parsek 2003;  Harrison et 
al. 2004]. Heavy metals are "oligo dynamic" meaning, a small amount of heavy  metal can 
show significant activity. In bacteria, heavy metals bind to enzyme proteins to kill  them 
or suppress the functionality of the enzymes they produce. From these facts, it is clear  
that for microbial remedi ation of dyes from tannery and textile effluents, it should be an  
essential  criterion  for the microorganism  to be tolerant  to high concentrations  of heavy  
metals.  
Patil et al. (2012) reported S.koreensis to produce surfactants capable of abatement of 
heavy  metals. In the present study, we check the dye -decolorizing ability of S.koreensis 
in the  presence of various concentrations of these heavy metals. Several enzymes present 
in bacteria  and fungi  are involved  in the biodegradation  of dyes.  Lignolytic  enzyme s like 
laccase,  manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, etc., break the azo groups of azo dyes 
to yield  compounds that contain a lesser number of benzene rings, for example, sodium 
naphthalene  sulfonate and cycloheptadienylium [Asses et al., 2018]. In add ition to the 
lignolytic enzymes,  some enzymes are specific for triphenylmethane dye degradation, 
such as triphenylmethane  reductase  and malachite  green  reductase.  The products  formed  
this way are significantly  lesser  toxic  than the  original  dye [Asses et  al.,2018; Wanyonyi 
et al.,  2017; Liu et  al., 2020].  
Nature has conceived a plethora of potent instruments in microorganisms that can be 
used for  human welfare. Only degradation of any toxic dye does not fulfil the ecological 
requirement:  a few studies sugge st that the dye degradation products are more hazardous 
than the dyes  themselves [Mishal and Gawai, 2018; Saini et al., 2018]. Toxicity    
11 
 assessment of the end  product obtained after any degradation process is crucial to 
validate the process's safety. The  use of an array of bioassays with organisms from 
several ecological ranks allows for a more  accurate assessment  of the environmental  
impact of  a toxic compound  introduced into  a given ecosystem.  
Photosynthetic bacteria is believed to play the crucial role of  oxygenation of the  earth’s 
atmosphere, when the earliest traces of life appeared and has since then formed the  
foundation of the aquatic ecosystem, which is the cyanobacteria [Sánchez ‐Baracaldo and  
Cardona,  2020].  The blue-green  algae  Anabaena  flos-aque  was chosen  for our study.  
Zooplanktons  feed on the aquatic  algae  and forms  the connecting  link for the transfer  of 
energy  between  the primary  photosynthetic  producer  organisms,  ie, the algae  and the larger  
vertebrates  like fish [Sterner, 2009; Lomartire et al., 2021]. Higher photosynthetic 
macrophytes like  duckweeds  (Lemna  minor ) also play significant  roles  in the water  
ecosystem.  Not only do they provide a habitat for the small amphibia ns, but also acts as a 
food source for certain aquatic  birds and fish [Cao et al., 2018]. Malachite green has the 
ability to pollute not only water, but  also land (industrial run -offs often contaminate 
adjoining land areas). Bacteria residing in the  soil are responsible  for nutrient  recycling,  
and plays  particularly  important  roles  in the carbon,  nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorous 
replenishment [Msimbira and Smith, 2020]. They are also  involved in production of 
plant growth hormones [Prasad et al., 2021]. Ea rthworms ( Eisenia  fetida ) lie above 
bacteria in soil ecosystem. Although they might appear insignificant and  unattractive, 
earthworms have the potential to modify the physical and chemical properties of  the soil, 
thereby influencing the life of other soil organisms [Bhadauria and Saxena, 2010].  
Chemical modification of soil include better availability of essential nutrients like 
phosphorus  and nitrogen to plants after being digested and excreted out into the soil by 
earthworms in the  form  of “earthworm  cast”. In terms  of physical  modification,  
earthworms  dig up tightly  packed  soils to allow air circulation, which in turn leads to 
better interaction of oxygen with bacteria  and promotes their growth [Lu et al., 2021]. 
Dyes are known to have negative impact on the germination of plants [Matpang et al., 
2017; Rajashekar et al., 2021; Rahman et al., 2018].  There can be significant and direct 
occupational exposure of malachite green to persons  working in  textiles,  tanneries  or 
aquaculture  farms  [Okafoagu  et al., 2017; Singh  and Chadha, 2016]. Effluents from these 
industries may run off into rivers or even into the urban water - supplies  thereby  causing  
non-point -source  pollution.  Consumption  of coloured  green  vegetables  and fish treated     
12 
 with malachite  green  for a prolonged  period  may also lead to direct  exposure of the 
toxicant to human beings. Given the constantly expanding dye industries,  determining 
the toxicity of textile dyes to the ecosystem is critical in determining the best  course of 
action for future environ mental safety concerns. The dye production industry has  raised  
awareness  about  numerous  environmental  challenges,  and products  with the least 
environmental  impact  are being  manufactured  and promoted.  The evaluation  of the 
impacts  of  textile dyes on the ec osystem, on the other hand, will pique the users' interest 
in adopting an  appropriate  treatment technology.

Remazol Brilliant Blue R is a highly recalcitrant and toxic dye extensively used as a 
synthetic  colorant in textile and tanneries. Although biological remediation of RBBR is 
more favorable  than non-biological  (physical  or chemical)  processes  in terms  of 
production  cost, maintenance   and ecological sustainability, reports of bacteria -mediated  
removal of RBBR are rare. Most of  the studies  regarding  the removal  of RBBR  report  the 
use of specially  functionalized  materials  whose production involves complex processing    
17 
 steps. Additional processing often leads to  elevated production costs (Sap utra et al., 
2017). Only a few RBBR degrading strains of fungi  have been reported to date, which 
may be due to the highly recalcitrant nature of the dye. A  comparison  of maximum  
monolayer  adsorption  capacities  of RBBR  dye on various  adsorbents   is presente d in

 INTROD UCTION  
Color is the first visible contaminant in the effluents of any industry that uses dye in its 
products. The presence of harmful organopollutants in the effluent causes the co lor in the 
majority of cases. Removal of dyes from industrial wastewater is essential to stop the 
toxic organopollutants from contaminating water sources as they adversely affect aquatic 
life and human health. Leather, textile, printing and  food processing are the most 
rigorous users of dyes and also belongs to the list of the gre atest contributors of coloured 
effluents (Biswas et al., 2019; Ardila -Leal et al. 2021). Most of the dyes have complex 
molecular structures and synthetic origins which give them high stability and thus 
become difficult to remove and are recalcitrant xenobi otics (Brunel and Dumur, 2020; 
Mohammed, 2021). Ninety  one bacterial strains were isolated from several sources and 
were subsequently characterised and cultured. Sources like effluents from dye -utilising 
industries like tanneries and textiles, jute -mills e tc. were explored as source of bacteria. 
Water samples from small local ponds, an urban canal, a river and an estuary were 
explored. Soil samples drenched in effluents and endophytes from two common aquatic 
weeds were also investigated. Malachite Green (MG ) is a triarylmethane dye. It is 
available mainly in two forms of salts: hydrochloride and oxalate. Here Malachite Green 
oxalate has been used. Apart from its widespread use in textile industries, it is also 
commonly used as a parasiticide in aquaculture s ince it is capable of preventing fungal 
attacks and protozoan infections (Yang et al., 2021)  Malachite Green has been reported 
to show high levels of toxicity in both fish and humans on prolonged exposure (Sinha 
and Jindal, 2020). Mutations, cancers and de velopmental abnormalities have been 
attributed to this dye (Alaya et al., 2020). Attempts have been made to decolorise 
Malachite Green using bacteria Kocuria rosea  (Parshetti et al., 2016), using fungus 
Cunnighamella elegans  (Hussain et al., 2017), and eve n by some waterborne pathogenic 
strains of actinobacteria, among many others (Vignesh et al., 2020).   
Textile industry is regarded as one of the prime sectors which contibuted enormously in 
the boost in the GDP of India. But while we celebrate the glory of  this industry and its 
share in the rising economy of our country, we cannot however overlook the fact that, 
textile again stands as one of the largest polluters of water worldwide, India being no 
exception. Water pollution poses as a major cause of concer n particularly for agricultural 
crops , since effluents released in the water bodies whose water is used for irrigating    
32 
 agricultural feilds are often loaded with toxic compounds. One of the most toxic 
components that are released through these effluents ar e the dyes. Remazol brilliant blue 
(RBB) is an anthraquinone dye, widely used in textile industries globally , is a potent 
toxic organo -pollutant and is frequently used as the precursor of many other dyes 
(Mechichi et al., 2006) . It is one of the most frequ ently utilized dyes in the textile 
industry (Ada et al., 2009).  Dichomitus squalens, Trametes trogii (Eichlerová et al., 
2005),  Pleurotus calyptratus and Ischnoderma resinosum have been reported to degrade 
RBBR (Saratale et al., 2009). In the present study , we have isolated bacteria from several 
different sources and have tried to explore their potential to decolorise some toxic 
industrial dyes.

Isolation of bacteria  
Effluents were collected aseptically in sterile containers for  the isolation of bacteria and 
were stored in refrigerator at 4ºC for subsequent use. These samples were procured from 
several different industries in and around Kolk ata, including, but not limiting to the ones 
that use dyes: Textile mi ll from Gangulibagan, Kolkata [P ]; Textile mill from Uluberia, 
Howrah [Z]; Jeans dying factory, Burrabazar, Kolkata [A], Domestic baatik unit from 
Madhyamgram, North 24 Parganas [B]; Sma ll printing press from Jadavpur, Kolkata [C]; 
Three tanneries from Park Circus area, Kolkata [D, W and I]; Tannery from Bhangar, 
South 24 Parganas [X]; A large dairy indus try from Dankuni, Hooghly [F]; and a  jute 
mill from Kamarhati, Kolkata [G]. For enric hment of total population of dye degrading 
isolates in the samples, 1 mL of the sample was aseptically added to 100 mL of nutrient 
broth and minimal salt medium. The flasks were incubated in shaking condition at 150 
rpm at 28°C for 6 days. The enriched cul tures were serially diluted up to10-3 dilution and    
35 
 the diluted cultures were spread plated aseptically and incubated at 28 -300C for 3 days.

 After analyzing the physiochemical characteristic of effluent it has been observed that 
there is not much difference in colour and odour, but differences were observed in pH, 
total solid content, COD and BOD. In case of the effluents from the textile mills, COD 
and BOD were almost around the Central Pollutio n Control Board (CPCB) tolerance 
limit, which may be due to some form of pre -treatment. Figure 2.1 shows places from 
where effluents were collected in and around Kolkata.  
 
Figure 2.1 Map showing places in and around Kolkata from where effluents were

Soil samples drenched by domestic waste -water [soil 1] and soil drenched by dairy 
effluent [soil 2] were collected. Soil suspensions were made (1 gram soil in 100ml sterile 
distilled water). Then they were serially diluted upto 10-6 dilution and plat ed on solid 
nutrient agar and minimal salt medium for isolation of single colonies for pure cultures.  
Three natural water sources: A pond from Shantiniketan, Birbhum [Water source 1], 
River Kopai, Birbhum [Water source 2],  The Hugli -Matlah estuary, South 24 Parganas, 
near Bay of Bengal [Water source 3] and water from an urban sewage canal at 
Keshtopur, Kolkata were also explored for isolation of dye degrading bacteria. Isolation 
was done using standard spread plate method. Figure 2.2 gives an overview of p laces 
from where natural water samples were collected for the isolation of bacteria.

Figure 2.2 Natural water sources for the isolation of bacteria  
 
Bacteria were also isolated from two common aquatic weeds: Water hyacinth 
(Eichhornia crassipes ) [Plant 1 ] and Duck Weed ( Lemna trisulca ) [Plant 2]. The 
endophytic bacteria used in this study were isolated from different parts of these two 
healthy growing aquatic weeds. The plant samples were washed under running tap water 
(pre-treatment) to remove debris and  air-dried before being cut into pieces of 5 cm2 in 
area. In order to elim inate epiphytic microorganisms surface sterilization was performed. 
The samples were immersed in 0.5% (v/v) Sodium -hypochlorite for 1 minute, and then 
washed in sterile distilled wat er, followed by washing in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 minute. 
Finally, samples w ere rinsed twice with sterile  distilled water for 1 minute each. The 
surface sterilized samples were blot -dried using sterile filter paper and then aseptically 
cut into 2 cm2 in area. The samples were then transferred aseptically onto nutrient agar 
and minimal salt medium plates and incubated at room temperature for a period of 1 
week. The plates were observed daily, and colonies were subcultured individually. 
Figure 2.3 depicts th e protocol for isolation of the endophytes.

Qualitative decolorisation assay in solid medium  
All the isolated strains were inoculated (streaked) into Mineral Salt plates ame nded with 
Malachite Green, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Congo Red, Cibacron Yellow, Crystal 
Violet, and Methyl Blue. These were incubated at 37˚C for upto 3 days. Strains which 
had zone of clearance on the otherwise coloured plates were selected as potential dye -
degraders. All the selected bacterial strains were maintained as pure cultures at 4˚C and 
used for further qua ntitative studies.  
 
Quantitative decolorisation assay in liquid medium  
All the selected strains isolated by qualitative analysis were individually inoculated into 
5 ml of the minimum salt medium. In conical flaks of 500 ml capacity, 300ml of minimal 
salt m edium each amended with the dyes (20 mg/L) were prepared. 1 mL of the 
previously prepared liquid culture (grown upto an optical density of 1 at 600nm) of the 
chosen strains was used to inoculate each flask.  These flasks were incubated at 37°C for 
7 days a nd the colour change was noted at regular intervals using UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 60). In order to compare the decolorisation ability of 
   
40 
 the different selected strains, the percentage degradation of dye was calculated and 
compared to the cor responding control. 10 mL of each dye -containing culture (from the 
conical flaks) were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet out the bacterial 
biomass. Absorbance of the supernatant of the centrifuged samples was recorded at 
respective absorbance maxima of the dyes. All assays were performed in triplicate. 
Uninoculated dye -less medium was used as blank and results were compared with 
uninoculated dye -amended controls.  
The decolorisation efficiency of different isolates was expressed according to the  
following formula (Equation 2.1):  
 
𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞  𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 =𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 −𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐗 𝟏𝟎𝟎

Identification of the selected bacter ial isolates  
The selected bacterial strains were identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and their 
morphological, biochemical and cultural characteristics were also studied.  
 
Genetic identification of the bacteria through 16S rDNA sequencing  
All of the six s elected strains of bacteria were identified genetically by analysing their 
16S rDNA. For this, the culture were provided to Xcelris, India. The identification was 
carried out in three major steps, as described below.  
 
Isolation of genomic DNA  
Cells grown i n nutrient broth were pelleted out at 10,000rpm for 5min and the 
supernatant was discarded. Then they were resuspended in TE (Tris -EDTA) buffer and 
their OD (600nm) was adjusted to 1 with TE buffer (10mM Tris; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). 
The cell suspension (740 µ L) was transferred to a centrifuge tube and 20 µL lysozyme 
(100 mg/ml) was mixed with it and incubated for 30 min at 37ºC. Next, 40 µL of 10%    
41 
 SDS (Sodium dodecyl Sulphate) was added to it. Aliquot of 8 µL Proteinase K 
(10mg/ml) was also added. This mixture  was incubated at 56 ºC for 3h. Addition of 100 
µL 5M NaCl was made. NaCl/CTAB (Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ) (100 µL) was 
added and the mixture was heated at 65 ºC and incubated for 10 min. A 24:1 mixture of 
chloroform:  isoamyl alcohol (0.5ml) was added . This was centrifuged at room 
temperature for 10 min at 10000rpm. The aqueous phase was transferred into a 
microcentrifuge tube and 0.5ml of phenol : chloroform: isoamyl  alcohol (25:24:1) was 
mixed. This was again centrifuged at 10000rpm for 10 min and the  aqueous phase was 
again transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. This process was repeated once more 
with 0.5ml chloroform : isoamyl  alcohol (24:1). 400 µL of the aqueous phase was 
transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and 240 µL ice -cold isopropanol w as added and 
incubated at -20 ºC for 2hr. Then this was centrifuged at 10000rpm for 15 min at 4 ºC. 
The pellet thus obtained was washed with cold 70% ethanol and this was centrifuged at 
10000rpm for 5min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was ke pt to dry at 
room temperature. Next, the pellet was resuspended in 170 µL of DNase -free water. For 
ethanol precipitation of the DNA, 3M sodium acetate (1/10 volume) and 2.5 volumes of 
100% ethanol was also added and the mixture was centrifuged down. It was  placed in -20 
ºC overnight. Next day, supernatant was carefully poured off and the pellet was washed 
in cold 70% ethanol. This was again centrifuged down at 4 ºC for 5min. The ethanol on 
top was pipetted out carefully and pellet was vacuum dried for 5min,  without the 
application of any heat. Finally the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of TE buffer. The 
purity of the DNA was measured 260nm/280nm absorbance ratio.  
 
Visualisation of the isolated DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis  
50 ml TAE buffer was mixed w ith 0.5 g agarose and was then heated until completely 
melted. Then 2 µl Ethidium bromide was added to the gel after the temperature reaches 
60°C, to facilitate visualization of DNA after electrophoresis. The solution was then 
poured into a casting tray co ntaining a sample comb and allowed to solidify at room 
temperature. The comb was removed after the gel solidified, with sufficient care not to 
rip the bottom of the wells. The gel is then inserted horizontally into the electrophoresis 
chamber and just cove red with buffer. DNA mixed with loading buffer were then loaded 
into the wells. The lid and power leads were placed on the apparatus, and a current was    
42 
 applied. After DNA had migrated upto 2/3rd distance, as indicated by the movement of 
gel loading dye, th e power supply was stopped. The gel was then taken out of the buffer.  
 
PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA  
Isolated DNA was amplified with 16S rRNA specific primers using Veriti® 99 well 
thermal cycler (Model No. 9902). A single discrete PCR amplicon band wa s obtained.  
The PCR cycle can be divided into the following steps:  DNA was denatured for 2 min at 
94°C prior to amplification and after amplification an extension step (7 min at 72°C) was 
undertaken. There were 28 cycles consisting of - denaturation at 94°C  for 30 sec, primer 
annealing for 1 min at 45°C and extension at 72°C for 1 min. The samples were held at 
4°C until analysis.  
 
Visualisation of the 16S rDNA by agarose gel electrophoresis  
The PCR amplified DNA was then observed by gel electrophoresis (per formed according 
to protocol mentioned above) on a 1.5% agarose gel. The PCR product was excised from 
the agarose gel with the help of Agarose Gel DNA Purification Spin Kit from HiMedia.  
 
Sequencing  
Sanger Sequencing was performed with the PCR amplicons. B i-directional DNA 
sequencing reaction of the PCR amplicons were carried out specific primers using BDT 
v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit on ABI 3730xl Genetic Analyzer. Consensus sequences of 
16S rDNA was generated from forward and reverse sequence data using alig ner 
software.  
 
Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment  
The 16S rDNA  sequence was used to carry out BLAST using the NCBI Genbank 
database, and corresponding sequences of homologous strains were obtained. Based on 
maximum identity score, sequences were selected and aligned using the multiple 
alignment software program ClustalW. The neighbor -joining method (Saitou and Nei 
1987) was employed to determine the strain's evolutionary history. In the bootstrap test 
(2000 replicates), the percentage of replicate  trees in which the related taxa grouped was    
43 
 shown next to the branches [ Felsenstein 1985 ]. The evolutionary distances were 
computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [ Tamura et al. 2004 ]. The 
evolutionary analyzes were conducted, and the phylo genetic tree was constructed using 
MEGA6 [ Tamura et al. 2013 ].

RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
A total of forty bacterial samples have been isolated from the  different effluent sources.  
Seven samples were isolated from the soil samples. The  natural water sources yielded as 
many as twenty -nine different bacterial strains. Significantly larger number of bacteria 
has been isolat ed from these water sources.  Eleven bacterial samples were isolated from 
aquatic plants Eichhornia crassipes and Lemna trisulca.  Four strains of bacteria could be 
isolated from the wastewater of urban sewage canal. Figures 2.4, 2.5,  2.6 and 2.7 depict

Four  strains of bacteria could be isolated from the wastewater of urban sewage canal 
(Table 2.10).  
Hence out of the ninety one bacter ial strains isolated from all the effluent samples, 
natural water sources, soil samples, aquatic plants and the urban canal; f orty five gave 
preliminary positive result for decolorisation of the chosen dyes.  
 
Qualitative decolorisation  
To get a clearer picture, decolorisation was monitored in liquid medium. The results thus 
obtained are tabulated below. Percentage decolorisation was calculated using formula 
previously mentioned in Equation 2.1.

ability could decolorise at least 20% (except S7) on the 3rd day and at least 35% on the 
7th day of the study. It is also observed that the two dyes Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBBR) 
and Malachite Green (MG) had been decolorised to the largest extent (≤50%) amongst 
all the dyes that were subjected to the decolorisation study by  the bacterial strains. 
Strains P14, P21 and P24 showed decolorisation of RBBR dye and strains P6, P9 and 
P12 showed decolorisation of MG dye more than 50%. From the quantitative assay these 
six strains were selected for further work (Figure 2.9).

The strain 9 was identified as Stenotrophomonas koreensis  by routine microbiological 
tests and 16S rRNA profiling (accession no. MK578830 received on submitting the 
nucleo tide sequence to GenBank). The phylogenetic tree (Figure 2.11A) obtained by 
neighbor -joining method shows the evolutionary relationships of this species with its 
homologous strains found in the GenBank database. The species is closely related to 
Stenotroph omonas acidiminiphila, S. maltophila  and S. ginsengisoli . Morphological 
studies indicated that the bacterium is rod -shaped (approximately 1 -2 μm in length) , non -
motile, Gram -negative, and does not produce endospores.  The colonies are round, with a 
   
59 
 smooth surface and margin, non -glossy, and pale yellow. Biochemical investigations 
revealed that the strain is positive for catalase, protease, and oxidase activities.

 The strain P24 was identified morphologically, biochemically, and through 16S rDNA 
profiling. The morphological and biochemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
The strain was Gram -positive, endospore -forming, and rod -shaped (approximately 1-
2µm in length and 0.5 µm in width). The colonies are pale cream, circular with a smooth 
surface and margin.  The strain is positive for catalase and oxidase activities. The strain 
was identified as Bacillus rigiliprofundi  by 16S rDNA profile analysis. Th e nucleotide 
sequence was submitted to GenBank (accession no. MK578829). The neighbor -joining 
method was employed to construct a phylogenetic tree that shows this species' 
evolutionary relationships with other homologous strains (Figure 2.11B). The strain was 
found to be closely related to Bacillus novalis , B.vireti , B.subterraneus  and B.thioparans .

 CONCLUSION  
A total of ninety  one strains of bacteria were isolated from several different sources like 
effluents from tanneries, textile industrie s, jute mills and dairies; from water samples 
from a pond, an urban canal, a river and an estuary; from soil samples, and from two 
common aquatic weeds. All these bacterial strains were checked for their ability to 
decolorise Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Cong o Red, Cibacron Yellow, Methyl Blue, 
Crystal violet and Malachite Gr een which are heavily used as colorants in textile and 
leather industries and are highly toxic. Qualitative assays on solid medium was done to 
choose dye decolorisers preliminarily, follow ed by quantitative assays in liquid medium 
to estimate their degradation potential in terms of percentage decolorisation. Based on 
the initial results the strains Stenotrophomonas koreensis  and Bacillus rigiliprofundi  
were selected for decolorising malachi te green and Remazol brilliant blue dyes 
respectively as they decolorised these dyes more than 50% within 3 -9 days’ time for 
further study and optimisation.

 INTRODUCTION  
Ryan et al. (2009)  exhaustively discussed the versatility of the genus Stenotrophomonas.  
Stenotrophomonas  sp has been reported to have several biotechnological applications. It 
enhances plant growth and de velopment. Up to 180% increase in growth of crops like 
wheat, tomato, lettuce, sweet pepper, melon, celery, and carrots in the saline soils of 
Uzbekistan [ Berg et al. 2010 ], production of the plant hormone Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) 
[Suckstorff et al. 2003 ], fixation of Nitrogen [ Liba et al. 2006 ], and oxidation of 
elemental Sulphur [ Banerjee et al. 2002 ] by this genus has been reported. These bacteria 
can metabolize many organic compounds, eventually protecting plants from phytotoxic 
effects [ Ryan et al., 20 09]. Among all the species of the genus Stenotrophomonas , S. 
maltophila  is probably the best -studied one. Although S. maltophila  is an opportunistic 
multi -drug-resistant pathogen [ Brooke 2012 , Looney et al. 2009 , Sánchez 2015 ], this 
species exhibits a rang e of degradative properties. It can degrade polypropylene glycols 
[Tachibana 2003 ] and decolorize triphenylmethane dyes like malachite green and crystal 
violet [ Alaya et al. 2021 ]. In the presence of copper, S. maltophila  produces laccase and 
can decoloriz e dyes like methyl blue, toluidine blue, methyl green, methyl orange, congo 
red etc. [ Galai 2009 , 2012 ] The strain Stenotrophomonas koreensis  has not been studied 
sufficiently and remained almost untapped for its potential applications. Only one 
applicatio n has been documented to date: S. koreensis can produce biosurfactants capable 
of abating heavy metals like Cadmium and Lead [ Patil et al. 2012 ]. To the best of our 
knowledge, before this study,  Stenotrophmonas koreensis  had not been reported as far as 
dye degradation is concerned.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Dyes, Chemicals and Media  
Malachite green oxalate, Methyl orange, Safranin, Methyl Red, Direct Yellow 27, Acid 
Orange 6, Cotton Blue, Basic Blue 3, and Naphthol Green B , polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 
and sodi um alginate  were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.  Dextrose, fructose, D -ribose, 
peptone, tryptone, urea, thiourea, sodium azide, calcium nitrate, calcium chloride, 
sodium nitrite, and beef extract were purchased from Himedia. Molasses were obtained 
locally. N utrient broth (Peptone 10 g/L; Beef extract 10 g/L; Sodium chloride 5 g/L; pH 
adjusted to 7) from Himedia Laboratories was used to isolate the bacterial strains.  
Decolorization experiments  
A loopful of Stenotrophomonas koreensis  was inoculated in 100mL nu trient broth in a 
250 ml flask and maintained at 37°C overnight for 18h in shaking condition. 5ml of the 
prepared bacterial culture was inoculated into 100ml malachite green oxalate powder 
dissolved in distilled water (100mg/L) and incubated at 37 °C. At p articular intervals, 
4ml aliquots were taken out, centrifuged at 10000rpm for 8min and the optical density of 
the supernatant was measured at 614 nm in an Agilent Cary 60 UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer. All experiments were performed in triplicate. An uninoculat ed 
solution of malachite green (100mg/L) was kept as control. The decolorization 
percentages were calculated according to the formula maintained previously in Chapter 2 
as Equation 1. The same equation is again given below, (Equation 1):  
 
𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞  𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 =𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 −𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥  𝐚𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐗 𝟏𝟎𝟎 
Equation 2.1     
67 
 Analysis of the decolorized product and confirmation of degradation of 
the dy e 
To analyze the decolorization and confirm degradation, UV -Vis, TLC, HPLC and FTIR 
were performed with the control dye and its degraded product. A scan (200 -800nm) of 
the dye before and after decolorization was carried out in a UV -Vis (Agilent, Cary 60) 
spectrophotometer to view the changes in the spectra. The decolorized product was 
centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to separate the cell mass. The supernatant was 
lyophilized to dryness, and the residue thus obtained was dissolved in a small volume of 
HPLC  grade methanol and used for further analysis by TLC, HPLC, and FTIR. For TLC, 
two solvent systems were used: (a) Propanol and (b) Butanol: Acetic acid: Water (4:1:2). 
The plates were visualized in an iodine chamber. FTIR of the dye and the product 
obtaine d after decolorization was performed using Bruker, USA (alpha model) 
spectrophotometer in the wavenumber range 450cm-1 to 4500cm-1. HPLC analysis was 
carried out (Waters model 2690) with C18 column. Methanol was used as the mobile 
phase with a flow rate of  1ml/min.  
Effect of various Carbon and Nitrogen sources on decolorization  
It is often seen that supplying nutrients accelerates the process of biodegradation of dyes. 
In an attempt to analyze the effect of Carbon (10g/L) and Nitrogen (1g/L) supplements 
on the decolorization medium, four different carbon sources (dextrose, fructose, D -
ribose, and molasses) and nine different nitrogen sources (organic: peptone, tryptone, 
urea, thiourea, soymeal extract, beef extract and inorganic: sodium azide, calcium nitrat e, 
sodium nitrite) were explored. The control consisted of an uninoculated malachite green 
solution (100mg/L) in distilled water, unsupplemented by any other organic or inorganic 
component.  
Response Surface Methodology for optimization of physical paramet ers 
for decolorization  
The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) is 
frequently used for experimental design, modeling, and optimization. Three independent 
physical factors: pH, temperature, and inoculum concentration, w ere taken into account    
68 
 for efficient decolorization of malachite green. RSM was employed to determine the 
optimal decolorization conditions using Minitab 19.0. Twenty experimental runs were 
performed. Each variable was studied at five levels. The experimen tal sequences were 
completely randomized in order to reduce errors. A model equation was generated and 
validated by experimental data.  A quadratic polynomial equation described the 
relationship between the dependent and independent variables:  
𝐘=ß𝟎+∑ß𝐢𝐗𝐢+∑ß𝐢𝐢𝐗𝐢𝟐+∑ß𝐢𝐣𝐗𝐢
𝐢<𝐣𝐧
𝐢=𝟏𝐧
𝐢=𝟏𝐗𝐣   
Equation 3.1  
Y is the predicted target function, i.e., the dye decolorization, ß 0 is the model constant, ß i 
is the linear coefficient, ß ii is the quadratic c oefficient, ß ij is the interaction effect 
coefficient, X i and X j are the dimensionless coded values and n is the number of 
independent variables.  Linear regression was plotted (predicted vs. actual), and the 
model's prediction accuracy was cross -verified b y Leave -One-Out-Cross -Verification 
(LOOCV) method in MATLAB R2021a.  
Decolorization of other dyes by the bacteria  
Decolorization of eight different dyes (50mg/L): Methyl orange, Safranin, Methyl Red, 
Direct Yellow 27, Acid Orange 6, Cotton Blue , Basic Blue  3, and Naphthol Green B , 
were used for the study of decolorization by this strain to explore if the strain was able to 
decolorize dyes other than malachite green.  
Immobilization of the strain  
Preparation of the biobeads  
1g each of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate were mixed in 70 ml boiling 
water. The solution was autoclaved at 1210C for 15 minutes and cooled. Variable 
volumes (1 -9 ml) of bacterial culture were added to the sterile solution. A cold, sterile    
69 
 solution of 5% calcium chloride was al so prepared. The mixture of PVA, sodium 
alginate, and bacterial culture was extruded drop -wise onto the 5% calcium chloride 
solution to form beads. The beads thus obtained were re -suspended into fresh cold, 
sterile calcium chloride solution under gentle ag itation for hardening. Loosely adhered 
cells and excess calcium chloride was washed away with sterile distilled water.  
Decolorization experiments with the immobilized bacteria  
The beads were tested for their ability to decolorize malachite green (100mg/L).  Beads 
obtained by immobilizing the variable volumes (1 -9ml) of bacterial cultures were 
incubated for 10 h with dye solution at 37 °C with occasional mixing. Percentages of 
decolorization were recorded at specific intervals. After completion of 10hr period , beads 
were removed and washed thoroughly but carefully in sterile distilled water. These 
washed beads were again used for the second batch of decolorization experiments.  
Decolorization of Malachite Green by S. koreensis  in the presence of 
heavy metals  
The potential of S. koreensis  to decolorize malachite green in the presence of heavy 
metals was analyzed. The decolorization percentages were recorded after adding heavy 
metals in the form of soluble salts: sodium arsenite, lead acetate, potassium dichromate , 
and cadmium acetate in various concentrations, and an uninoculated control was kept 
where no heavy metal salt was added.  
Determination of enzyme activity  
The activity of different enzymes responsible for malachite green decolorization was 
studied for S. koreensis . Enzyme analyzes were performed using methods described by 
Jadhav and Govindwar, 2006 and L. -N.Du et al., 2011. Bacterial cultures grown 
overnight were centrifuged at 10000rpm for 8 min. Cell biomass was washed thrice, 
suspended in 5 ml phosphat e buffer, sonicated (sonicator output 60 amp, three strokes of 
30 s each keeping 2 min interval at 4ºC) . The resultant cell -lysate was the source of 
crude enzyme for the enzyme analysis.  Laccase activity was estimated by taking 10% 
ABTS (2,2′ -Azino -bis 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt in 0.1 M    
70 
 acetate buffer (pH 4.9) and measuring ABTS oxidation at 420 nm using molar extinction 
coefficient 29300 M-1cm-1. Reaction mix ture contained 100 μL cell -lysate and the total 
volume was maintained at 3 ml. Tyrosinase activity was determined by adding 100 μL 
cell lysate in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.01% catechol, total 
reaction volume being 3 ml. The catechol qui none thus produced was measured at 410 
nm with molar extinction coefficient 1623 M-1cm-1. Lignin peroxidase activity was 
measured by observing the production of propionaldehyde at 300 nm using molar 
extinction coefficient 20 M-1cm-1. This was done by addin g 100 μL cell -lysate in a total 
reaction mixture of 2.4 ml containing 100 mM n -propanol, 250 mM tartaric acid and 10 
mM H 2O2. MG reductase activity was estimated by monitoring the reduction of 
malachite green at 620 nm using the extinction coefficient 1.47 x 105 M-1cm-1. Reaction 
mixture (4 mL)   consisted of 20mgL-1 malachite green, 50 μM NADH and 100 μL cell -
lysate in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). NADH -DCIP Reductase activity 
was measured by monitoring the reduction of DCIP at 590 nm using the  extinction 
coefficient 90 mM-1cm-1. The reaction mixture (4 mL) contained 50μM NADH, 50 μM 
DCIP and 100 μL cell -lysate in    50mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).  
Degradation Kinetics  
The kinetics of degradation of malachite green by S. koreensis  under optimal 
decolorization conditions was studied by the procedure mentioned in Du et al. (2012). 
After the strain was inoculated into the dye solution, aliquots (4ml) were collected at 
specific time intervals and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 8 min. The absorbance of the 
supernatant was measured at 614 nm. The following equations can describe the kinetics 
of degradation of dyes by microorganisms according to Das et al, 2010:

k2=second order rate constant  
The results obtained were plotted in C t vs. t, ln Ct vs. t, and 1/Ct vs. t graphs and then 
analyzed.  
Toxicity studies   
The ecotoxicological assessment of the biode gradation product of the toxic dye 
malachite green by S. koreensis  was performed with a wide range of aquatic and 
terrestrial organisms, representing the key levels of the ecosystem following Gioia et al. 
(2018); Amin et al. (2020) and Khan et al. (2020), while adhering to the OECD 
guidelines. To calculate an endpoint for quantitatively expressing the toxicity of the dye 
and the degradation product, a range of treatment solutions were prepared by two -fold 
serial dilutions as mentioned in Gioia et al. (2018) . Hence, undiluted, 50% diluted, 25% 
diluted, 12.5% diluted, and 6.25% diluted initial dye concentration used in all previous 
experiments (translating to 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.5 mg/L malachite green respectively) 
along with their corresponding degradatio n products were tested.     
72 
 Aquatic toxicity studies  
Aquatic toxicity was measured using four indicative organisms of the four levels of the 
aquatic ecosystem: the primary producer, algae Anabaena flos -aque , (algae growth 
inhibition test), aquatic plant Lemna  minor  (growth inhibition test), primary consumer 
crustacean Daphnia magna  (acute immobilisation) and secondary consumer zebra -fish 
Danio rerio  (acute toxicity) .   
Algae growth inhibition test  
Algae growth inhibition test was conducted for a period of 96h maintaining the OCED 
201 (2011) guidelines for toxicity testing. The unicellular blue -green algae Anabaena 
flos-aque  was used for this study. The cyanobacterial pure cultures were subcultured in 
BG11 medium [NaNO 3 1.5g, K 2HPO 4 0.04g, MgSO 4.7H 2O 0.075g, CaC l2.2H 2O 0.036g, 
Citric acid 0.006g, Ferric ammonium citrate 0.006g, EDTA (disodium salt) 0.001g, 
Na2CO 3 0.02g, Trace metal mix A5 1.0mL, distilled water 1L (pH 7.1 post -sterilization); 
Trace metal mix A5: H 3BO 3 2.86g, MnCl 2.4H 2O 1.81g, ZnSO 4.7H2O 0.222g, 
NaMoO 4.2H 2O  0.39g, CuSO 4.5H 2O 0.079g, Co(NO 3).6H 2O 49.4 mg, distilled water 1L] 
and maintained under with 16h light and 8h dark photoperiod at 25±2ºC. Aliquots of 
algal culture were inoculated into BG 11 medium with malachite green and 
corresponding degrad ation product separately. The initial biomass density was 
maintained at 0.1 mg/mL for all the experiments. A. flos -aque  cultures including a dye -
less control and the degradation product were also set up similarly. These were incubated 
at 28 ºC under 16h il lumination in continuous shaking condition for 96h. Care was taken 
such that no other organic or inorganic contaminants could intervene the system. After 
96h, 5mL algal aliquots were filtered through Whatman GF/F 25mm filter paper and 
dried at 60  ºC for 8h . The average specific growth rate is calculated as the log of the 
biomass increase over a specific period of time and is calculated by the formula (3.5) 
[OECD 201 (2011)]:

 Lemna acute toxicity  assay  
The second level of aquatic toxicity bioassay was performed using the fresh -water 
macrophyte Lemna minor , through experiments designed according to the OECD 221 
(2006) guidelines for toxicity testing. The aquatic plants were collected duri ng the month 
of June from the Jadavpur University ponds and were thoroughly cleaned and then 
cultured in Hoagland’s medium for eight weeks. The healthy plants were screened out 
and used for further work and maintained under laboratory conditions for anothe r 7 days. 
Then, 3 colonies, each consisting of 4 fronds were aseptically transferred into 250 ml 
borosilicate glass beakers containing 100 ml distilled water amended by the dye (6.25 - 
100 mg/L), the corresponding degradation products and a dye -less control . Each of the 
test solutions, along with the control were kept in triplicate at 25 ºC and 16h photoperiod. 
After an exposure of 96 h, the plant biomass for each treatment were recorded as a 
measure of toxicity. For estimation of the fresh weight, excess wa ter was carefully 
blotted out from the samples from each set and transferred to pre -weighed tubes. Now 
tubes were re -weighed and the fresh weights were obtained by subtracting the weight of 
the empty tubes from the total weight. The specific growth rate an d % growth inhibition 
were estimated from Equations 3.5 and Equation 3.6 respectively. The total chlorophyll 
content was also measured for all the treatment groups. For the estimation of chlorophyll 
content, the plants were washed several times in order to  remove any traces of dye, and 
method described in Arnon, (1949) was followed. Total chlorophyll was extracted in 
80% acetone (2 ml) in a pre -cooled mortar -pestle and the extract was centrifuged at 3000 
rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for the spec trophotometric assay using Agilent 
Cary 60 UV -Vis spectrophotometer.  
Daphnia magna  acute immobilisation assay  
Daphnia magna  is a microcrustacean, representing the lowest level of aquatic zoological 
organism. For the third level of aquatic toxicity testing , these were used in accordance 
with the OECD 202 guidelines [OECD, 2004]. Adult daphnids were procured from Neet 
Aquarium, Tamil Nadu and were cultured in 2 L glass beakers having 1.6 L hard water 
(160 mg/L CaCaO3) each having 20 adult daphnids. The set -ups were maintained in the 
incubator at 20ºC with a 16h photoperiod. The daphnids were transferred to fresh water 
each week and the neonates obtained from the third broods were used for further studies.    
75 
 For the acute immobilization tests, five neonates were  carefully transferred in 100ml 
glass beakers containing 80 ml test solutions (6.25 -100 mg/L malachite green and the 
corresponding degradation products) using sterile glass pipettes and the beakers were 
kept covered with watch glasses. No food was provided  during this phase and 
immobilization or death was recorded after 24 and 48h.  
Danio rerio  acute toxicity assay  
Acute toxicity test was performed using zebra fish ( Danio rerio ) to estimate the effect of 
malachite green (6.25 -100 mg/L) and the corresponding  degradation product following 
the OECD 203 (2019) guidelines with some modifications. Each set consisting of ten 
zebrafish of average length 2.0±1.0cm and average weight 0.45±0.05g were exposed to 
malachite green, the degradation product and a dye -less co ntrol. Experiments were 
conducted in glass aquaria holding 10L water with a photoperiod of 16h and water 
temperature 25 °C. Fish mortality and abnormal behaviour or appearance were recorded 
at regular intervals. Histopathological analysis of tissue section s were also performed.  
Toxicity assays with land organisms  
Toxicity studies on beneficial soil microorganisms  
Strains Bacillus subtilis  (ATCC 21332) and Bacillus pumilus  (ATCC 7061) which are 
commonly found in soil, were used to assess the impact of the dy e (100 mg/L) and its 
degradation product. To estimate the impact of the dye and the degradation product on 
the growth of these bacteria in liquid medium, 1ml logarithmically growing cultures 
having optical density 1 at 600nm was inoculated in 100 ml nutrie nt broth. Growth was 
analysed by incubating the bacteria in the dye, the degradation product and a dye -less 
control and the cell density was checked periodically till stationary phase was reached. 
The antibacterial effect of Malachite Green as well as the degradation product on these 
bacteria were evaluated. Disc diffusion method was employed to assess the impact of 
MG and the degradation products, while sterile distilled water was taken as control. 
Diameters of zones of inhibitions were measured after an o vernight (18h) incubation at 
37°C.     
76 
 Eisenia fetida  acute toxicity assay (contact test)  
Acute toxicity assessment (contact test) was performed using earthworm ( Eisenia fetida ), 
according to the OECD 207 (1984) guidelines. The E. fetida  were acquired from Aa stha 
Earthworms, West Bengal. Sterile 30ml borosilicate glass culture vials were lined with 
same size of filter papers (suitably cut to fit within the vials) soaked in test solutions. In 
each vial, one healthy adult earthworm was carefully placed. The test  was conducted for 
48hr. Five vials (carrying one earthworm each) were maintained for each of the test 
solutions, the corresponding degradation product and sterile distilled water as control.  No 
food was provided during the tenure of the study. Mortality r ates were recorded every 
24h intervals.  
Phytotoxicity  
Toxicity of the Malachite Green and the degradation product was evaluated using two 
economically important crop plants: wheat and pulses. Seed germination index, and root 
and shoot lengths were taken in to account. Tests were performed by methods as 
described in Biswas et al. (2016). Triticum aestivum  and Lens culinaris  were obtained 
locally. Ten seeds of each of the crops were placed in separate petriplates lined with filter 
papers soaked in equal volume s of test solutions (Malachite Green, the degradation 
product and a dye -less control). Germination was continuously monitored on a day to 
day basis. The lengths of plumules of the germinated seeds were measured and the 
number of seeds germinated was counte d each day until further germinations stopped. 
Seeds which showed emergence of radical piercing through the seed coat were 
considered to be germinated. Data for germination and were recorded on the 3rd, 9th and 
16th days.  
Genotoxicity  
Allium cepa  bulbs of  uniform size and weight (3 -3.5g approximately) were obtained 
locally and the outer loose flaky scales were removed carefully with the help of a pair of 
forceps. The fresh root primordia that emerged as a result of the denudation step were 
immersed in the test solutions (6.25 -100 mg/L Malachite Green, the corresponding 
degradation products and a dye -less control).  These set -ups were maintained at a    
77 
 temperature of 25 °C for 72h with a 16h photoperiod. Terminal 1cm portions of the 
actively growing root tips were excised and rinsed with distilled water and fixed in 
Carnoy’s solution1 (1:3 Glacial acetic acid: ethanol). The fixed root tips were hydrolysed 
in 1N HCl and then stained with 2% aceto -orcein. Slides were prepared with a drop of 
acetic acid (45%) foll owed by squashing. The squashed root tips were then observed 
under Leica DM 750 microscope and photographed with Leica DFC295 camera.  
Cytotoxicity  
Two cell lines (keratinocyte HaCaT and cancer cell line HepG2) were used for this 
study. MTT assay and DAPI imaging of the cells using various concentrations of 
Malachite Green (100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/L) and the corresponding degradation 
products were performed. HaCaT cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's Modified 
Eagle Medium (DMEM) media having 10%  Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) with 1% 
antimycotic -antibiotic solutions and were maintained at 5% CO 2 and 95% humidity. 
HepG2 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) media containing 1X 
antibiotic and 10% FBS at 37 °C and were maintained at 95% h umidity and 5% CO 2. 
Both the cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 1 x 104 cells per well. 
The cells were incubated for 24 hours and they were treated with varying concentrations 
of the dye and the degradation product in order to evaluat e the toxicity following 
standard MTT cell proliferation assay. Furthermore, the effects of the test solutions over 
the cellular viability was assessed using DAPI fluorescent staining following the 
manufacturer’s protocol and visualized by fluorescence mic roscope (Olympus IX71).   
Blood/serum toxicity and histopathology  
The undiluted dye (100 mg/L) and the degradation product were tested for the 
blood/serum toxicity and histopatholoy using mice ( Mus musculus ).  All the experiments 
were performed following t he institute animal ethical approval. All the animals were 
individually maintained with proper ventilation and 12 h light and dark cycles and 
provided with sterilized food pellets and water ad libitum. For the purpose of evaluation 
of acute systemic toxici ty of the malachite green and the degradation product, mice were 
fed with 2 g/ Kg of body weight for 30 days of duration. After completion of the study    
78 
 period, the mice were anesthetized using Diazepam (IP, 10 mg/kg body weight) and 
Xylazine (IP, 10 mg/kg body weight) subsequently. Followed by anesthesia, about 1 ml 
of blood was collected using facial vein puncture for serological analysis. The control 
and test animals were euthanised and organs like kidney, lungs, liver, spleen and heart 
were aseptically c ollected for histopathological analysis. All the organ samples were 
fixed using 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin and subsequently maintained in the room 
temperature. The fixed tissue samples were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
staining followed by p araffin -embedding and sectioning respectively.  
All studies performed with animals were conducted on approval of the Institute Animal 
Ethical Committee of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  
Statistical Analysis   
All data were analysed by one -way ANOVA with Tukey -Kramer multiple comparison 
test.

 RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
Decolorization of Malachite Green by  Stenotrophomonas koreensis  
Malachite green oxalate solution (100  mg/L) in distilled water was subjected to 5mL 
culture of S. koreensis  and decolorization was observed intermittently. Nearly 90% 
decolorization was recorded at 2h. Decolori zation gradually increased to 98 % at the end 
of 4h (Figure 3.1). No additional supplement had been added in the decolorization 
medium. This is the first repor t of S. koreensis concerning the degradation of malachite 
green.  
 
Figure 3.1 Malachite green decolorisation profile of Stenotrophomonas koreensis  
To date, very few studies have reported such high rates of decolorization (98 % 
decolorization in 4h) of mala chite green from aqueous solution in the absence of a 
nutrient -rich medium. Only recently, Song et al. (2020) reported that Pseudomonas 
veronii  could utilize malachite green as the sole carbon source. P. veronii  degraded 
93.5% malachite green (50 mg/L) in seven days from an aqueous solution [Song et al. 
2020]. High malachite green decolorization has been reported by Lv G.Y. et al. (2013), 
where the strain Deinococcus radiodurans  R1 achieves 97% decolorization of malachite 
green within 0.5 h, initial dye con centration being 200 mg/L in tryptone yeast medium. 
   
80 
 Laccase enzyme isolated from the strain Trichoderma asperellum also showed excellent 
malachite green decolorization (97.18%) within 98.58 min [Shanmugam et al. 2017]. 
However, this exceptional result may be attributed to the purified enzyme where 
obviously, additional steps of purification had to be performed. The only other strain that 
shows a comparable efficiency level was reported by Du et al. (2012), where 
Micrococcus sp. strain BD 15  has been shown t o decolorize malachite green (100mg/L) 
up to 97% within 1 hr.  
Confirmation of Biodegradation of the dye  
TLC results indicated complete degradation of the dye and formation of new compounds. 
In the propanol solvent system, Malachite Green showed an Rf value  of 0.7380, whereas 
the degraded product showed two spots with Rf values 0.571 and 0.714 (data not shown).  
In the butanol: acetic acid: water (4:1:2) solvent system, three spots appeared with Rf 
values 0.488, 0.627, and 0.744, while the control spot had a n Rf value of 0.651 (data not 
shown).  
For decolorization of dyes, HPLC is considered to be a valuable technique to 
differentiate between degradation and biosorption. The disappearance of particular peaks 
and the simultaneous appearance of resultant peaks indicate degradation of dye 
components and the production of new compounds. Three prominent peaks were 
observed at retention times 4.415, 4.721, and 5.170 minutes on performing HPLC of the 
degradation product, while the  control dye gave a peak at 4.550 min utes (Figure 3.2).     
81 
  
Figure 3.2 HPLC chromatogram of malachite green before (a) and after (b) 
degradation  
In the UV -Vis spectrophotometric analysis, a characteristic λ max of malachite 
green was observed at 614 nm in the UV -Vis spectrum (Figure 3.3), which  is absent in 
degraded product indicating the disruption of the structure of malachite green due to 
degradation. A peak around 250  nm in the malachite green indicates the characteristic 
peak of the benzene ring. In the degraded product, the intensity of th is peak increases 
considerably, indicating the formation of more benzene rings accompanied by extended 
conjugation in structure due to degradation. A peak around 205  nm in the degradation 
product indicates the characteristic peak of the solvent water and t he merged peak around 
230 nm may be due to the formation of conjugated products of degradation.  
   
82 
  
Figure 3.3 UV -Vis spectra of malachite gre en before and after degradation  
 
In FTIR spectrum (Figure 3.4) in 1400 -1600cm-1 aryl amine, C=N and NH2 
stretching of primary and secondary amine are present in control malachite green. With 
degradation, the breaking of bonds decreases peak intensity, indicating a considerable 
decrease in these groups (aryl amine C=N and NH2). The formation of more COOH and 
C=O groups and increase in amines resulted in the enhancement of peak intensity over 
2500 -3000 cm-1 in the degraded product. Two to three bands around 1600 cm-1 due to 
C=C of benzene ring present in the malachite green have diminished after degradation, 
indicating be nzene ring opening. Characteristic meta/para -substituted benzene ring peak 
around 650 -900 cm-1 was present in the control dye. However, in the degraded product, 
the intensity of these peaks decreased considerably, which may be due to the opening of 
the ben zene ring by degradation resulting in disruption of para and meta substituted 
position. Around 3200 -3400 cm-1 the N -H stretching and shifting towards 3600 cm-1 after 
degradation indicates the formation of –OH group present either in alcoholic or phenolic 
form. Again peak intensity in the range 3200 -3400 cm-1 for –OH of -COOH has 
increased significantly, indicating the formation of a lot of acidic -COOH groups. The 
hump around 3200 -3600 cm-1 indicate the presence of hydrogen -bonded –OH groups in 
the degraded  product, whereas in undegraded malachite green, this hump is absent, and 
the sharp peak is present in considerably less intensity between 3500 -3600 cm-1 (may be 
due to oxalic acid of malachite green oxalate). Prominent aromatic –CH stretching 
around 2980 cm-1 in the control dye is not present in the degraded product.

From all the above analyzes, it was clear that decolorization of malachite green 
took place due to biodegradation of  dye by S. koreensis .  
Impact of Nitrogen and Carbon supplements on decolorization  
Often, the supply of additional carbon or nitrogen sources causes stimulation of 
the dye degradation process [ Sihag et al. 2014 ]. The impact of organic and inorganic 
nitroge n supplements (1g/L) on the decolorization process was also explored. Six organic 
sources (soymeal extract, beef extract, peptone, tryptone, urea, and thiourea) and three 
inorganic sources (sodium azide, sodium nitrite, and calcium nitrate) of Nitrogen wer e 
used (Figure 3.5a and 3.5b). The organic complex supplements outperformed the 
inorganic supplements. The addition of soymeal extract resulted in 95% decolorization 
within 1h and 98% within 2.5h. Peptone enhanced the decolorization to 98.6% within 
2.5hr. Urea also had a strong positive impact on decolorization (97.91% in 2.5hr). The 
effect of carbon sources (10g/L) like dextrose, fructose, ribose, and molasses were 
studied. Figure 3.5c shows the comparative results. Dextrose and fructose boosted 
decoloriza tion to 90% in 1h and 94% in 2.5h due to the bacteria's absorption and 
metabolization of the readily available carbon sources [Carolin et al. 2021].

different org anic (a) and inorganic nitrogen (b) and carbon (c) sources  
   
85 
 Physicochemical conditions affect the rate and efficiency of dye degradation to a 
considerable extent. Vignesh et al. (2020) reported about 60% decolorization of 
malachite green by Streptomyces ch restomyceticus  in 96h, but on supplementation of 1% 
glucose and pH7, the decolorization increased to 99%. In this study, the supplements of 
carbon sources like fructose amplified the decolorization of malachite green by S. 
koreensis . Fructose enhances bact erial decolorization of methyl orange by Aeromonas  sp. 
strain DH -6 (Du et al., 2015). For methyl orange decolorization by Micrococcus 
yunnanensis , glucose was found to be the optimal carbon source [Carolin et al. 2021], 
but on the other hand, glucose was a lso reported to inhibit malachite green decolorization 
by Kocuria rosea  [Parshetti et al. 2006]. We observed that the addition of ribose and 
molasses inhibited the process of decolorization by S. koreensis . However, Parshetti et al. 
(2006) reported 100% de colorization of malachite green by Kocuria rosea  in the 
presence of 0.5% molasses. So it can be presumed that the effects of carbon supplements 
on the process of decolorization greatly vary with the bacterial strains and the dyes 
involved.  
Degradation of m alachite green by S. koreensis  was enhanced by applying 
supplementary nitrogen sources, especially soymeal extract and peptone. Modi et al. 
(2010) reported similar results where peptone strongly enhanced azo dye decolorization. 
Peptone was reported to be t he best nitrogen source for producing malachite green 
degrading enzymes like laccase and manganese reductase in white -rot fungi [Levin et al. 
2010]. Anthraquinone dye degrading laccase production by Pleurotus ostreatus  was 
enhanced in the presence of urea [Jang et al. 2005]. Hence, it can be concluded that the 
presence of organic nitrogen supplements in the decolorization media positively 
influences the production and functioning of enzymes responsible for the degradation of 
malachite green and thus hastens  decolorization.   
Estimation of a response surface for maximal decolorization  
Central Composite Design (CCD) was applied to optimize the three variable factors: pH, 
temperature, and inoculum size. The highest decolorization was 98.78%, at pH 6, 
temperature  45ºC, and inoculum 6.36ml. The response obtained thereby were expressed    
86 
 as a function of the independent variables (Table 3.1). A regression model was created in 
Minitab 19.0.  
The model equation for the decolorization was expressed as:  
Percentage Degrada tion = -32.7 + 8.65 pH + 3.658 Temperature + 1.59 Inoculum - 
0.796 pH*pH - 0.04460 Temperature*Temperature - 0.384 Inoculum*Inoculum+

The prediction accuracy was cross -validated by the Leave -One-Out-Cross -Verification 
(LOOCV) method using MATLAB R2021a. Cross -validation is a technique used to    
88 
 analyze test errors. He re, the data is divided into two parts: a training set and a validation 
set. In LOOCV, each observation serves as the validation set, while the remaining (n -1) 
observations (n is the total number of observations) serve as the training set. The model 
is fitted, and the data is used to forecast an observation value. The process is repeated n 
times. This technique aids in the reduction of bias. In this study, the model's fitness was 
substantiated by the cross -validated correlation coefficient (94.05%) between the actual 
and predicted decolorization and indicated that the model was significantly close to the 
actual experimental results (Figure 3.6). Hence the model could be applied for correct 
predictions.  
 
Figure 3.6 Regression plot of decolorization: predicti on by the model vs. actual 
decolorization  
  ANOVA results indicated that the model was highly significant, as suggested by 
the F value (21.4) and a very low p value (Table 3.2). The p values of the linear terms 
were <0.01indicating pH, temperature, and ino culum size had a significant influence on 
decolorization.

 Effect of interactions of the process variables  
The contour plots generated using Minitab 19.0 (Figure 3. 7a, 3.7b, 3.7c) indicates the 
collective effects exerted by combinations of the process variables. A pH in the range of 
6 to 8 and a temperature of 40 °C to 50 °C gives the highest decolorization (Figure 3.7a). 
An increase in the inoculum size correspondin gly improves decolorization (Figure 3.7b). 
The maximum removal efficiency was obtained at 45 ºC and 6.36mL inoculum. Below 
30 ºC and beyond 60 ºC, decolorization is significantly reduced. When inoculum and 
temperature are varied simultaneously, the tempera ture, rather than the inoculum size, 
profoundly influences the decolorization percentage (Figure 3.7c). Although more 
inoculum leads to greater decolorization, if the optimum temperature is not provided, the 
decolorization would be of low grade. pH 6 -8 is optimal for the decolorization process. 
pH plays a role as vital as the temperature in malachite green degradation. Highly acidic 
pH like 4 or highly alkaline pH like 10 is inhibitory to the decolorization process. Rather 
than the conventional "one -factor -at-a-time" optimization approach, the RSM model 
provides an idea of the combined effect of the variable parameters. Using RSM also 
gives an additional advantage of identifying a "range" rather than a particular value for 
an optimized response, decolorizati on. 
Experimental confirmation of RSM  
Another three experimental runs validated the model under the optimal conditions 
obtained from CCD ( pH 6, temperature 45 ⁰C, and inoculum size 6.36ml). The 
decolorization percentage obtained experimentally under the give n optimal conditions 
was 97%. Hence, the experimentally derived aligned with the decolorization predicted by 
the model (98.78%).

 In our study, S. koreensis  was able to show maximum degradation of malachite 
green at a considerably higher range of temperature (40ºC -50 ºC). Although dye 
biodegradation is known to occur most commonly at temperatures up to 35 ºC , 
biodegradation at higher temperatures has also been documented. Purified enzyme 
Triphenylmethane Reductase (TMR), responsible for decolorizing triphenylmethane dyes 
like malachite green and crystal violet, was isolated  from  Citrobacter  sp. and worked 
optimally at temperature 60ºC [Hou et al. 2004]. Surface -expressed TMR on E. coli 
exhibited high activity and stability at 50  ºC [Gao et al. 2014]. Azoreductases present in 
two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were reported to work optimally at 40ºC 
[Elfaras h et al. 2017]. The range of suitable pH for decolorization of malachite green by 
S. koreensis  was 6 to 8. The decolorization of malachite green has been reported to occur 
over a wide range of pH: ranging from alkaline to acidic. Pseudomonas veronii  can 
decolorize malachite green maximally at a nearly neutral pH (7.1) [Song et al. 2020]. 
The optimum pH for malachite green degradation by Photobacterium leiognathi  is 8 
[Sutar et al. 2019]. Slightly acidic pH was optimal for the degradation of malachite green 
by Achromobacter xylosoxidans  [Qiao et al. 2011].  
Potential of S. koreensis  on the decolorization of other dyes  
Several dyes, including some azo and triphenylmethane dyes, were treated with S. 
koreensis . Various decolorization patterns were observed (Figu re 3.8).  The most 
promising resu lt was recorded in the azo dye Methyl Or ange, which was decolorized up 
to 96% at the end of 10 days. More than 80% decolorization was also recorded for 
Methyl  red. However, this trend was not followed by the other  azo dyes l ike Acid orange 
6 or Direct Y ellow. Safranin and Direct Yellow  showed the least decolorization. Overall, 
S. koreensis  could efficiently decolorize a triphenylmethane dye (malachite green) and an 
azo dye (methyl orange) simultaneously offers a promising alt ernative for bioremediation 
of textile or tannery effluents which very often contain multiple dyes.

koreensis  
 
Chemically and structurally diverse synthetic dyes are frequently present in the 
industrial wastewater from tanneries and textiles. As a result, a consortium of micro bes is 
required to decolorize the effluents, with each strain decolorizing a different dye. Reports 
of a single strain capable of decolorizing multiple classes of dyes with very different 
structural and chemical characteristics are rare. S. koreensis  can d ecolorize 
triphenylmethane dye malachite green as well as azo dyes like methyl orange and methyl 
red. Another example of a bacterium capable of decolorizing an azo dye as well as a 
triphenylmethane dye is Kocuria rosea MTCC 1532. It was able to decolorize both 
methyl orange and malachite green [Parshetti et al., 2006].  
Immobilization of S. koreensis   
Bacteria are often immobilized into beads for easier handling. Variable volumes of S. 
koreensis  cultures were immobilized into PVA -sodium alginate beads (Figu re 3.9). 
When 9ml S. koreensis  culture was immobilized into beads and employed to decolorize 
malachite green (100mg/L), it showed 95.49% decolorization in 10 h (Figure 3.10). 
   
93 
 However, the efficiency of decolorization was much lower than the culture in its basic 
form. If 9ml culture is immobilized into beads and used, the same decolorization 
percentage (95%) could be obtained in 3 h. However, immobilization provides other 
advantages over liquid culture. Apart from handling convenience, these beads can be 
recovered and reused easily after two to three washes of sterile distilled water. Although 
decolorization was much slower in the second batch, more than 68% of dye could be 
decolorized in 96 h. Blank beads (without bacterial culture) were also employed to 
decolorize malachite green but showed no decolorization. The prepared beads remain 
viable for up to three weeks if stored at 4 °C.

 Many authors have studied the decolorization of dyes by microorganisms 
immobilized in beads. About 81.7% Yellow GR dye was degraded by Bacillus subtilis  
immobi lized in sodium alginate beads (Narayanan et al., 2015). Electrospun cellulose 
acetate nanofibrous web (CA -NFW) was used by San et al. (2014) to immobilize 
bacterial strains and degrade 95%methylene blue within 24h. Aspergillus oryzae was 
used as a natural  immobilization agent to immobilize  Pseudomonas sp.  DY1, which 
showed up to 93% malachite green decolorization [Yang et al. 2011]. Phugare et al. 
(2010) described Plaster of Paris as a cheap, readily available material to immobilize 
yeast cells and decolor ize malachite green.  
Effect of heavy metals on decolorization of malachite green  
A time -dependent decolorization study was conducted in the presence of the  heavy 
metals: chromium, cadmium, lead, and arsenic, which are nearly almost invariably 
present in t annery and textile effluents (Figure 3.11). In all the cases, heavy metals 
negatively impacted decolorization compared to the control (no heavy metal). As a 
general trend, high doses of heavy metals in the media cause retardation in bacterial 
growth. An in crease in heavy metal concentration correspondingly resulted in a decrease 
in decolorization percentages. Patil et al., 2012 reported S. koreensis  to remove lead and 
cadmium from the medium by producing bio -surfactants. However, only 10% 
decolorization was  recorded in the presence of 0.1 g/L cadmium. S. koreensis  
decolorized more than 80% malachite green in 3h in the presence of 0.01g/L lead in the 
medium. Decolorization was reduced to less than 30% in the presence of 0.1g/L 
chromium. The effect of arsenic was relatively milder: even at a concentration of 0.25 
g/L arsenic, 87% decolorization could be achieved within 3h.     
95 
  
Figure 3.11 Effect of heavy metals (a) cadmium, (b) chromium, (c) lead and (d) 
arsenic on the degradation efficiency of malachite green by  S. koreensis  
 
Congo red degradation by Pseudomonas sp . was reported to remain significantly 
unaffected by the presence of the heavy metal chromium due to its highly potent 
chromium reductase enzyme [Gopinath et al. 2011]. Zinc, copper, and lead inhibited the 
decolorization of dye Poly R -478 in Lentinula edodes  [Hatvani & Mécs 2003]. Lorenzo 
et al. (2006) reported a striking observation: some heavy metal ions like Ag+, Mn2+, Cd2+, 
and Zn2+ exhibited a slight stimulatory effect on laccase production from Trametes 
versicolor,  which resulted in the enhanced decolorization efficiency for indigo carmine 
dye. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  strain HF5 was able to decolorize more than 90% 
Reactive Red 120 even in the presence of 100 mg/L lead [Hafeez et al. 2018]. 
Psychroba cter alimentarius  KS23 and Klebsiella oxytoca  N7 decolorized 83% Reactive 
Black 5 in the presence of 100mg/L Chromium [Khalid et al. 2015].  S. maltophila  is 
resistant to heavy metals and can grow in their presence [ Alonso et al. 2000 , Pages et al. 
2008 ]. However, whether the presence of heavy metals affects its decolorizing ability has 
not been studied. Patil et al. (2012) reported S. koreensis resistant to heavy metals like 
   
96 
 Cadmium and Lead. In the present study, it was observed that S. koreensis  could 
decolorize malachite green in the presence of heavy metals to varying degrees, 
depending upon their concentrations.  
Enzyme Analysis  
Bacteria produce dye degrading enzymes in two forms: constitutive and inducible. The 
constitutive enzymes are present at all ti mes, even in the absence of dyes, while inducible 
enzymes are secreted only in the presence of the dyes [Sari and Simarani, 2019]. Table 
3.3 represents the data obtained on the analysis of the malachite green degrading 
enzymes of S. koreensis . The laccase and lignin peroxidase concentration was higher in 
the control cells than those obtained after decolorizing malachite green. The activities of 
tyrosinase, MG reductase, and NADH -DCIP reductase increased significantly in cells 
that decolorized malachite gree n, suggesting that the dye induced the activity of these 
three enzymes when present in the medium. Thus from the experimental results, it can be 
concluded that tyrosinase, MG reductase, and NADH -DCIP reductase contribute 
significantly to the decolorization  of malachite green by S. koreensis .

Bacteria produce several enzymes which can degrade dyes. Azo -reductase, 
laccase, lignin peroxidase,  aminopyrine N -demethylase,  manganese peroxidase, 
malachite green reductase, triphenylmethane reductase etc. are some of the widely 
studied dye -degrading enzymes. Both purified enzymes  [Shanmugam et al. 2017; Yang    
97 
 et al., 2016]  and bacterial cultures have been used to degrade dyes. Significant increases 
in the activities of MG redu ctase and NADH -DCIP reductase were reported for the 
degradation of malachite green, indicating the involvement of these inducible enzymes in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Jadhav and Govindwar, 2006].  Mn-peroxidase, NADH -
DCIP, and MG reductase were responsible  for the  biodegradation of malachite green by  
Pseudomonas  sp [Du et al., 2011].  Tyrosinase, laccase, Lignin Peroxidase, NADH -DCIP 
reductase, and MG reductase facilitated malachite green degradation by Aeromonas  sp. 
[Du et al., 2018]. Liu et al. (2020) clone d the genes Lac (laccase), MnP (manganese 
peroxidase), and LiP (lignin peroxidase) from Aspergillus  sp. TS -A into the fungus 
Pichia pastoris. The recombinant genes were expressed in P. pastoris  and showed 
efficient degradation of the azo dye Congo Red. Mor eover, it was observed that the 
combined effect of all the three enzymes was more robust than the individual enzyme. 
Hence, similarly,  the genes responsible for malachite green degradation in S. koreensis  
can be expressed in other species and exploited for  heavy metal resistant malachite green 
degradation.  
Kinetics of degradation  
It is necessary to perform kinetic investigations to understand the conditions and 
mechanisms for pollutant degradation [Zhan et al., 2020]. The kinetics of degradation 
was analyz ed under the optimal decolorization conditions. Figure 3.12 (a), (b), and (c) 
shows the plots for the kinetics study. It can be observed from the kinetic plots that the 
R2 value for the ln C t vs. t plot is the highest, i.e., 0.978 (compared to the other mo dels, 
where R2 values are 0.84 and 0.82 for the zero order and second -order kinetics, 
respectively), indicating the reaction is best fitted to the equation Ct = C 0e-kt. Therefore 
the decolorization of malachite green by S. koreensis  can be described by a f irst-order 
model, and the first -order rate constant k 1 is 0.04min-1. The first -order rate constant 
represents the amount of malachite green biodegraded or eliminated from the solution in 
a given period.  In this study, the first -order rate constant is 0.04 per min, which means 
that ∼0.04% of the amount of dye remaining in the solution is biodegraded each minute 
[Hinderliter & Saghir, 2014]. The rate constant is calculated from the slope of the ln C t 
vs. t plot, as shown in  Figure 3.12b.      
98

vs t (a), 1/Ct vs t (b) and lnCt vs t (c)  
   
99 
 The kinetics of biodegradation gives crucial information about the efficiency of 
the process and the viability of scaling it up [Wanyonyi et al., 2017]. Biodegradation of 
dyes following the first -order reaction kinetics has been reported by many authors 
previously. Biodegradation of acid dye Azo Red 18 followed the first -order kinetics 
[Koupaie et al., 2012]. Ochrobactrum  sp followed the first -order kinetics during the 
degrada tion of malachite green [Vijayalakshmidevi and Muthukumar, 2014]. Etezad and 
Sadeghi -Kiakhani (2021) reported that the  biodegradation of malachite green by soil 
bacteria followed the first -order reaction kinetics. Enzymatic degradation of Reactive 
Orange 1 3 by Alcaligenes faecalis  followed first -order kinetics [Shah et al., 2012]. 
Wanyonyi et al. (2017) reported a similar observation where enzymes from Bacillus 
cereus  degraded malachite green following first -order kinetics.  
Toxicity of malachite green befo re and after treatment  
The ecotoxicological evaluation of malachite green biodegradation by S. koreensis  was 
performed with a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, representing the key 
levels of the ecosystem. To calculate an endpoint for quanti tatively expressing the 
toxicity of the dye and the degradation product, a range of treatment solutions were 
prepared by two -fold serial dilutions as mentioned in Gioia et al. 2018. Hence, the 
undiluted, ½ diluted, ¼ diluted, 1/8 diluted and 1/16 diluted d ye (translating to 100, 50, 
25, 12.5 and 6.5 mg/L malachite green) and the corresponding degradation products were 
tested.  
Aquatic toxicity  
Algae acute toxicity assay  
A gradual decrease of the average specific growth rate could be observed with the 
increa se in dye concentration giving clear indication of toxicity to the algae (Figure 
3.13). The undiluted degradation product showed 26% inhibition, while dye 
concentrations higher than 50 mg/L lead t o complete inhibition of growth (Figure 3.14) . 
The percentag e inhibition of growth was also calculated from the specific growth rate. 
For 6.25 mg/L malachite green and its degradation product, the percentage inhibition of 
growth were 44.31% and 4.26% respectively, indicating a significantly lesser toxicity    
100 
 (p<0.05)  of the degradation product than the original dye.  Algae forms the basic level of 
all aquatic ecosystems. The impacts of the toxic element that inhibits the growth of these 
primary producers will inevitably reach the ecosystem's upper layers. Only a very l imited 
amount of research has been performed to determine the toxic effects of textile dyes on 
microalgae compared to other toxicants like heavy metals [Gita et al., 2019]. The effect 
of Indigo dye containing effluent on Scenedesmus quadricauda  was studied  by Chia and 
Musa (2014). They observed a systematic decrease of cell number with the increase in 
effluent concentration. The specific growth rate of yeast continually decreased with 
increasing concentrations of Reactive Blue 172 and Direct Red 28 [Solis e t al., 2012]. 
Gita et al. (2019) studied the effect of Optilan yellow, Drimarene blue and Lanasyn 
brown on Chlorella vugaris. They observed 100% growth inhibition for 30ppm dye 
concentrations for all the three dyes [Gita et al., 2019].  All of the above -mentioned 
literature supported the observations of the present study. Although there are  a few 
articles on the toxicity of dyes on algae, this is the first report on the toxicity assessment 
of the degradation product of malachite green on any microalgae. Sinc e there is a paucity 
of data on the toxic effects of malachite green and its degradation product on microalgae, 
this article will aid future  investigations.

Lemna acute toxicity assay  
The floating macrophyte Lemna mi nor is a common biological indicator used for toxicity 
estimation. The specific growth rates of the plants steadily decreased with the increase in 
the dye concentration till 50 mg/L (Figure 3.15 and Figure 3.16). The highest specific 
growth rate was record ed for the control group. The specific growth rates of the plants 
grown in all the concentrations of the degradation product were significantly higher (p < 
0.01) than the corresponding concentrations of the dye. More than 73% inhibition of 
growth was recor ded for the undiluted malachite green. A similar trend could be noted in 
case of the chlorophyll content of the L. minor . The lowest total chlorophyll (0.3 mg/g 
fresh weight) was recorded for in the plants grown in the highest concentration of the dye 
(Figure 3.17). Almost colourless fronds appeared in the Lemna  grown in 100 mg/L 
malachite green (Figure 3.18). Lesser chlorophyll contents correspond to lower 
photosynthetic capability and results in a lower biomass. Chlorophyll content of plants 
grown in the degradation product, although less than that of the control, was significantly 
higher (p < 0.01) than that of the plants grown in the higher dye concentrations.  
Lemna minor  is a bio -indicator plant that colonies in freshwater bodies and is commonly 
employe d for the evaluations of environmental and toxicological concerns. Adomas et al 
(2020) studied the effect of the textile dyes Gentian Violet on the growth parameters of 
L. minor . They reported that Gentian violet  changed the putrescine (Put) production 
   
102 
 pathway, raised tyramine content, inhibited S -adenosyl methionine decarboxylase 
activity, and inhibited ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Micropollutants like 
caffeine, benzophenone, bisphenol, etc., exerted inhibitory effects on the growth and 
chloroph yll production of Lemna minor  [Fekete -Kertész et al., 2015]. Presence of even 
very nominal amount of dye in the growth media can cause distortions of the leaf and 
root anatomy. For example, 0.01μg/L Congo Red causes severe shriveling of upper and 
lower epidermis. At 0.04μg/L Congo Red , reduction of mesophyll tissues and dissolution 
of aerenchyma occurs in L. minor  and leaves start falling at the bottom of the aquarium 
[Al-Zurfi et al., 2020].

Daphnia magna  immobilisation assay  
The dye and the degradation product were tested for potential ecotoxicity on the 
representative zooplakton Daphnia magna . No deaths were observed in the lowest dye 
concentration (6.25 mg/L) in the first 24 h. While all of the daphnids died within 2h of 
exposure in the highest dye concentration (100 mg/L), more than 86% viability was 
recorded for the daphnids treated with the undiluted degradation product. Significantly 
higher viability (p <0.01)) was observed in the Daphnia  neonates for those exposed to 
the degradation product than those exposed to the dye, as represented in Figure 3.19. A 
microscopic image of D. magna  with internalized malachite green is depicted in Figure 
3.20.  Daphnia  magna , the aquatic microcrustacean can survive in a variety of water -
bodies ranging from fresh water ponds to acidic lakes [Ebert, 2005]. The toxicity of 
   
104 
 textile dyes and their degradation products have been tested on D. magna  by some 
authors. Gioia et al . (2008) decolorised the two toxic azo dyes Acid Red 88 and A cid 
Black 172 by immobilised  laccase enzyme of Trametes villosa . In the D. magna  acute 
toxicity test, the dye Acid Red 88 showed lesser toxicity than the degradation product. 
Approximately 100% a nd 60% death of the neonates were recorded for the undiluted 
degradation products and the dye (100mg/L) respectively. The non -genotoxic dye Direct 
Blue 218 has a 48h LC50 of 3.6mg/L for D. magna  [Bae and Freeman, 2007]. Lumbaque 
et al. (2015) observed that  the degradation product of the azo dye Reactive Black 5 was 
slightly more toxic than the original dye due to the production of aromatic amines during 
the degradation process. For azo dyes, in most of the cases, the degradation products 
were more toxic tha n the original dyes, due to the production of copious amounts of 
aromatic amines. The 48h EC50 value for Daphnia magna  ranged from 0.29 -0.77 mg/L 
for azo dye Reactive Black 5 [Material Safety Data Sheet of Malachite Green Oxalate 
salt, Sigma -Aldrich, 2014;  Kanhere et al., 2014]. However, in case of triphenylmethane 
dyes like malachite green, the observations are different. Plachtová et al., (2018) reported 
that except for algae and cyanobacteria, the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
had no harmfu l effect on Lemna minor  or D. magna up to a concentration of 1 g/L. This 
result is consistent with the observations of the present study where the product of 
malachite green degradation by S. koreensis  is significantly less toxic than the original 
dye (p<0 .05).

Danio rerio  acute toxicity assay  
Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) treated with malachite green showed loss of equilibrium, 
production of excessive mucus, and convulsion. The fish treated with the undiluted dye 
showed hemorrhagic lines anterior to the anal fin and 1 00% fish mortality was recorded 
within 38min.  For the lowest dose of malachite green (6.25 mg/L), all the fish died 
within 3h ( Table 3.4). The experiment was carried out for 7 days with the corresponding 
dosages of the degradation product, although no dea th or abnormal behavior was 
recorded for degraded product.  
Liver of zebrafish is a model for studying liver diseases in humans. Bile improves lipid -
soluble nutrient absorption while also facilitating the excretion of cholesterol and toxic 
metabolites, esp ecially bilirubin [Romano et al., 2020]. Prominent dilations of the bile 
ducts were observed in the fish exposed to the dye and it progressively increased with the 
increase in concentration of the dye while the ones treated with the degradation product 
showed no significant morphological changes (Figure 3.21 ). Dilation of the bile ducts in 
case of alcoholic liver disease in zebrafish had been previously reported by Lin et al. 
(2015). Dilated bile duct may be a manifestation of cholestasis which is a disease  that 
disrupts bile flow, resulting in bile fluid accumulation in the liver. Significant morbidity 
and mortality may be caused by cholestasis due to pruritus, malnutrition, portal 
hypertension, biliary cirrhosis etc. [Pham and Yin, 2019]. The actual blocki ng of bile 
flow at the level of extrahepatic biliary ducts is a major mechanism of cholestasis and 
retained bile leads to hepatotoxicity [Shah and John, 2019]. Failure to transport these bile 
salts results in their accumulation in the liver. The bile salts ' powerful detergent -like 
effect causes membrane injury and degradation of membrane function which is reflected 
by the histopathological examinations of Danio  liver tissues ( Figure 3.22). 
   
106 
 
Histopathology of zebrafish exposed to the treatments (1/8th dilutio n and above) gave 
clear indication that liver tissues showed significant damage for the dye -treated fish 
while the ones treated with the degradation product remained almost unaffected, apart 
from slight dilations of sinusoids. The polygonal shape of the he patocytes was clearly 
disrupted, along with irregular or broken cell borders indicated cell damage in case of the 
dye-treated fish. The hepatocytes of dye -treated fish showed abundant pyknotic nuclei 
indicating their moribund condition on H&E stained secti ons, compared to the control 
and degradation product treated ones. Lin et al., 2015 investigated hepatocytes with 
condensed cytoplasm in Danio rerio  and reached the conclusion that they contained 
glycogen or mucosubstances like glycoproteins, glycolipids o r mucins. Severely dilated 
sinusoids were also observed in the liver of the dye -treated zebrafish. Dilation of 
sinusoids is caused by enlargement of hepatic capillaries and usually leads to blockage in 
the hepatic venous outflow [Branchatelli et al., 2018] .

 Malachite green has been already reported to exert detrimental toxicity on liver [Donya 
et al., 2012]. But our study revealed that the product obtained after the biolog ical 
degradation of malachite green by this bacterium renders it remarkably safe. Thus, it can 
be stated that degradation of the dye by the bacteria leads to mitigation of the toxic 
effects that the untreated dye exerts on aquatic life.  
Toxicity to benefi cial soil bacteria  
 Microbial toxicity assay  
Several bacteria that inhabit the soil adds to the soil fertility by processes like nutrient 
mineralization, promotion of plant growth hormones or playing roles as plant pest 
repellents. We chose two such strain s Bacillus  subtilis  and Bacillus  pumilus  to see if the 
dye and its degradation product exert any toxic effect on them ( Figure 3.23 and 3.24). 
This was important because, the dyes that come out through the effluents not only pollute 
the rivers, water -bodies  and oceans alone, but also contaminate adjoining land areas. The 
growth curves of the two bacterial strains were observed after exposing them to the 
undiluted dye (100 mg/L) and its degradation product. In case of the undiluted dye -
exposure, a prominent e xtension of the lag phase was observed. The lag phase is known 
to prepare the bacteria for the upcoming phases of the growth cycle. An extended lag 
phase therefore indicates that the bacteria required more time to prepare itself for 
reproduction which, in turn, is a clear sign of toxicity. On the other hand, the bacteria 
grown in presence of the undiluted degradation product followed a very similar timescale 
as of the control. The removal of toxicity in the degradation product could thereby be 
claimed.     
109 
  
Figure 3. 23 Growth curve of Bacillus subtilis  after exposure to dye and degradation 
product  
 
Figure 3. 24 Growth curve of Bacillus pumilus  after exposure to dye and 
degradation product  
For a closer look and to assess the exact amount of decrease in toxicity,  a conventional 
agar-cup assay was performed. No inhibition zone was observed in case of the 
degradation product, while clear halo of 53 mm and 62 mm was recorded for the 
malachite green for B. subtilis  and B. pumilus  respectively (Figure 3.25 and  Table 3.5). 
Microbial toxicity studies have been used by many authors for testing the ecotoxicity of 
dyes and their degradation products. Staphylococcus aureus  was subjected to malachite 
   
110 
 green and product of its degradation by Bacillus vietnamensis . Compared to th e 
malachite green (50 mg/L), the degradation product showed no inhibition zone at all, 
indicating its lesser toxicity to S. aureus  [Kabeer et al., 2019]. Malachite green (100 
mg/L) was more toxic than its degradation products on Escherichia coli  [Chen et a l., 
2009]. Chaturvedi and Verma (2015) employed the bacterium Ochrobactrum 
pseudogrignonense to degrade malachite green. Agar cup assays with S. aureus  indicated 
that the degradation products were significantly safer than the undegraded malachite 
green.  Enterobacter asburiae degraded malachite green and its degradation products 
were non -toxic to Micrococcus luteus , Klebsiella pneumonie  and Aspergillus sp  
[Mukherjee and Das, 2013]. Gopinathan et al. (2014) observed that malachite green 
extended the lag phase  of non -target soil bacteria and fungi like Bacillus subtilis, 
Azotobacter  sp. Saccharomyces cerevisiea  etc. The observations of the present study 
were consistent with these reports.

 Eisenia fetida  acute toxicity assay  
Just like the beneficial soil bacteria, earthworm Eisenia fetida  also contributes to soil 
fertility. They are also known as “natural tillers of the earth” and form an integral part of 
vermicomposting. These organisms are important from the aspect of organic farming 
which is now regarded as one of the most ecologically s ustainable techniques for 
increasing soil fertility, rather than the use of chemical fertilisers. Earthworms respire 
through their skin and the chemicals to which they are exposed are directly absorbed 
inside their body through the skin. A contact toxicity  test was performed by exposing the 
earthworms to dye and the degradation product. In 48h, only a slight decrease in viability 
was observed (93.4%) when compared to the control (100% viability). E. fetida  exposed 
to the undiluted malachite green showed sev ere damage leading to their decomposition, 
while the ones exposed to the undiluted degradation product showed no significant 
alteration in their appearance  (Figure 3.26 and 3.27) . Significantly reduced toxicity in 
terms of the organism’s viability was exhi bited by the degradation product compared to 
dye concentrations ¼ th dilution onwards (p <0.01).  
Several authors have reported bloody lesions, depigmentation and detachment of 
posterior part of the body under the effect of toxic pesticides in earthworms [R ao and 
Kavitha, 2004; Reddy and Rao, 2008; Yasmin and Souza, 2010]. Similarly, toxic textile 
dyes can be lethally ecotoxic towards E. fetida . For example, the textile dye Acid Red 
causes DNA damage and death in coelomates including E. fetida [Sathya et al. , 2009]. 
Gopinathan et al. (2014) studied the effect of malachite green on some non -target soil 
organisms including E. fetida . The estimated 48h LC 50 was 2.6 mg cm-2. The azo dye 
Red BS and Methyl Red were tested on Pheretima posthuma . The LD 50 of Red BS a nd 
Methyl Red dye solution was 120.22 and 218.77 mgL−l, respectively. Initially sluggish 
movements were observed, followed by reduction in pigmentation, development of 
multiple lesions and death.  When the degradation product was evaluated in P. posthuma , 
the toxicity was much lower: no deaths were reported after 48 hours of application of 
degradation product of the 100mg/L Red BS [Gupte et al., 2013]. Observations of the 
present study are consistent with the above reports.

Phytotoxicity  
Wheat and pulses are the major cereal crops and forms the staple diet of the Indian 
subcontinent. Germination of seeds is a fairly common approach to determine 
phytotoxicity of the chemicals to the  crops. Out of the two crops, Triticum aestivum  
seemed to be more affected by the toxicity of the dye, where germination was completely 
inhibited on exposure to the undiluted dye (100 mg/L), while the corresponding 
degradation product lead to 58.3% germina tion. In case of Lens culinaris , more than 85% 
germination was recorded for the 1/16th dilution of the degradation product, which is 
nearly comparable to water (89.35%). Significantly higher germination rates were 
recorded for both the crops grown in the d egradation product than those grown in the dye  
(Figure 3.28) . Phytotoxicity is the inhibitory effect exerted by a toxic element on plant 
germination and overall growth. If utilized for irrigation in agricultural fields, untreated 
industrial effluents conta minated with dyes and other hazardous chemicals may be 
detrimental. When water is scarce, however, sufficiently treated and recycled wastewater 
can be utilized instead. In this scenario, phytotoxicity testing is critical. Several plant 
   
113 
 species have been us ed for the assessment of phytotoxicity. Lucerne seeds grown in 
malachite degradation products showed germination rates similar to water [Du et al., 
2011]. Nicotiana tabacum  and Lactuca sativa seeds showed similar results [Yang et al., 
2015]. Amin et al. (2 020) studied both aquatic and terrestrial phytotoxicity of Direct 
Red-81and its degradation product. The dye inhibited Lemna minor  growth, while its 
degradation product was significantly less toxic. Phytotoxicity tests with Vigna radiata , 
Raphanus sativus,  and Abelmoschus esculentus  showed similar results where the 
untreated dye was more toxic than the degradation product. The degradation of Congo 
Red by recombinant enzymes expressed by Pichia pastoris  yielded degradation products 
that were less toxic than the original dye [Liu et al., 2020]. In our study, phytotoxicity 
experiments indicated that biodegradation of malachite green by S. koreensis  generated 
significantly safer and less toxic compounds.

 Serum toxicity in mice   
It was observed that the serum albumin values of the dye -treated (100 mg/L) animals 
increased when compared with the degradation product. Serum albumin ha s been 
reported to have a positive correlation with hypothyroidism [Koga et al., 2009]. 
Increased serum levels may be attributed to its impaired metabolism as a result of the 
malachite green treatment. The albumin and cholesterol values of the animals expo sed to 
the undiluted degradation product were observed to be significantly lower than the dye 
treated animals. Similarly, the increase in the serum cholesterol levels may be due to the 
effect of thyroid hormone on the cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. The presence of 
elevated amount of both HDL and LDL cholesterol in blood serum could be due to the 
effect of hypothyroidism that ultimately resulted in the increased values of cholesterol. 
Most of the circulating enzymes, transporters of mammalian system c an be regulated by 
the macromolecular concentration of metabolites. It was reported by Sinha et al., (2018) 
that the incidence of hypothyroidism might be associated with Non -Alcoholic Fatty 
Liver Disease (NAFLD). The increased values of total protein and u ric acid of the 
malachite green treated animals were comparable with the effects of NAFLD. These 
might be due to the stress experienced by the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells that 
may have led to oxidative stress and insulin resistance to the dye trea ted animals. The 
onset of these effects might have induced hyperuricemia and higher total protein 
concentration in serum of the dye treated animals when compared with the control. It is 
well known that malachite green could directly impart toxic effect to the liver [ National 
Toxicology Program, 2005 ]. Here, in this current study, malachite green treatment seems 
to have exerted toxicity to the animals similar to NAFLD. The degradation product 
treated animals’ serum values for total protein; uric acid was sig nificantly low when 
compared with dye treated animals. It can be inferred from these observations that 
malachite green degradation by the S. koreensis  showed reduced toxicity levels in 
animals when compared with the toxicity levels exerted by the original dye. However, 
the values of triglyceride have not shown any increase in the dye treated animals. This 
might be due to the short course of the dye treatment to the animals. Figure 3.29 depicts 
the serum toxicity analysis.

 Genotoxicity  
The genotoxic effect of malachite green and its degradation product were analyzed by 
taking into ac count the MI (mitotic index) and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations 
in onion root tip cells. Allium cepa was used as a model plant because it has many 
advantages as a research material, such as ease of handling, sensitivity, quick analysis, 
low cost,  and the ability to be used in correlation with other models that use mammalian 
cells [Chaparro et al., 2010].  The MI is defined as the number of cells undergoing mitosis 
divided by the total number of cells where all stages of mitosis are included in the count. 
Higher or lower MI with respect to the control can be indicative of an alteration of 
mitosis mechanisms [ Leme and Marin -Morales, 2009]. The MI was scored for each 
concentration of malachite green and the degradation product by analyzing 
approximately  5,000 cells. The control showed the MI 8.18%. There is a clear reduction 
of MI corresponding with the increase of the dye concentration. The minimum MI was 
obtained 4.37% for the undiluted malachite green, whereas for the undiluted degraded 
product, the M I was 5.28%. This obs ervation suggests that  the toxicity of the dye was 
definitely reduced from its original form. Besides scoring MI, evaluation of 
chromosomal abnormalities in dividing cells were studied for estimating toxicity of the 
dye and the degrada tion product. All the results indicated that the degradation product 
was less toxic than the dye, but more toxic than the control (water). Study of 
chromosomal aberrations provide important information and may be considered an 
efficient method to investiga te the genotoxic potential of the various textile dyes and 
effluent [Kalyani et al., 2012]. The chromosomal aberrations are shown in Figure 3.30. 
Several types of chromosomal aberrations were observed such as c -mitosis, laggards, 
anaphase bridges, sticky chromosomes and telophase bridges. Increasing the 
concentration of the dye led to an increase in the rate of aberration as in  Table 3.6 . 
Among all the chromosomal abnormalities, C -metaphase, chromosome -bridge and sti cky 
chromosomes were observed more frequently. Stickiness in the chromosome may arise 
due to DNA depolymerisation, nucleoprotein dissolution, breakage and exchange in 
basic folding fibre units of chromatids, and stripping of protein covering of the DNA in 
chromosomes [ VC and Stephen, 1980 ]. Fiskesjö (1985) stated that a sticky chromosome 
has an irreversible toxic effect that may lead to cell cycle cessation. The chromosome 
bridges indicate the clastogenic activity of the toxic agent  [Leme and Marin -Morales,  
2009] . The laggard chromosomes are formed due to the degradation or depolymerization 
of the chromosomal DNA [Liu et al., 2004]. Genotoxicity studies fulfil the essential    
117 
 purpose to determine the toxic potential of a compound from the environmental point o f 
view. In our study, although the biodegraded malachite green also showed a reduction in 
MI and some chromosomal aberrations, but they were in a significantly lower rate than  
that of the original dye. In A.cepa  root-tip cells, those treated with the degra dation 
product had 50% lesser chromosomal aberrations than those treated with the untreated 
dye.

Cytotoxicity assays with human cell l ines 
To test the toxicity of the dye and the degradation product, on human cell lines, growth 
of HaCat and HepG2 were used. Viability of both the cell lines were significantly higher 
for the degradation product treated cells than those exposed to all dilu tions of the dye, 
which was evident through the MTT results (p<0.01). That the bacterial treatment of the 
dye has reduced its toxicity to a considerable extent is c learly reflected in the results 
(Figure 3.31).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.31 Effect of malachite gr een and the degradation product on HepG2 (a) 
and HaCat (b) cell lines  
From the DAPI staining it can be clearly inferred that the degradation product was less 
toxic to both the cell lines when compared to the dye (100 mg/L). Increase in dye    
119 
 concentration le ad to increased cell death. Nuclear fragmentation is prominently visible 
in much higher densities in the cells exposed to the dye than those exposed to the 
undiluted degradation product obtained after the bacterial treatment ( Figure 3.32).

Histopathology with mice  
The liver tissue of the animals fed with Malachite green the dye showed the presence of 
degenerated hepatocyte cells when compared with the ones treated with the degradation 
product group and the control group ( Figure 3.33). The hepatocytes of the animals fed 
with malachite green were strewn in the hepatic parenchyma wi th deeply stained 
nucleus. Degeneration of hepatocyte of the dye -fed animals was observed in various 
spots. The hepatic cells of malachite green group animals did not show any prominent 
nucleus which might be due to the ductal hyperplasia induced by the Ma lachite green 
dye. Hepatic blood vessels of the MG treated animals were observed to be dilated when 
compared with the dye and control group. No toxicological symptoms were observed in 
the histopathological sections of kidney and spleen of the animals. The medullary and 
cortical region of the kidney of all group of animals were prominent without any 
evidence of morphological disorientation. The reticular frame work of the spleen cells 
treated with the dye, its degradation product or the control group animals  did not show 
any change in their orientation.

Ecotoxicity of dyes and their corresponding degradation products have  been previously 
studied by many authors but were restricted to only a few species for each work [Amin et 
al. 2020; Gupte et al., 2013; Khan et al, 2020]. The novelty of the in the present work lies 
in fact that the entire range of representative organisms  from the land and aquatic 
ecosystem were taken into account. The use of a battery of bioassays with organisms 
from several taxonomic groups allows for a more accurate assessment of the 
environmental impact of a chemical molecule or mixture introduced into  a given 
ecosystem [Gioia et al., 2018]. Biological experiments using a variety of processes and 
organisms have been used to assess the toxicity of dyes and the products generated from 
various decolorization treatments [Bafana et al., 2011]. Ecotoxicity re sults might be 
difficult to compare to other reported data since they are dependent on various aspects, 
such as the chemical nature of the dyes, the approach used in the bioassay,  the biological 
model, the research question and the  expression of outcomes [ Gioia et al., 2018].  
In essence, we tested the product obtained after the biodegradation of malachite green by 
Stenotrophomonas koreensis  to compare its toxicity with the untreated dye. We started 
off at the base of the aquatic ecosystem, the green photos ynthetic algae Anabaena flos -
aque  and the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor (growth inhibition test). We worked with 
   
121 
 Daphnia magna , the zooplankton (acute immobilisation) and then the aquatic vertebrate 
Danio rerio  (fish acute toxicity). We also tested the re presentative organisms from the 
land ecosystem. The soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis  and Bacillus pumilus  were used to 
perform the microbial toxicity. The two economically important crop plants Triticum 
aestivum  and Lens culinaris were used to evaluate phyt otoxicity. Genotoxicity was 
studied using the root tip cells of Allium cepa .  Acute toxicity assay was performed in 
earthworms ( Eisenia fetida ). We worked with the higher mammal Mus musculus  for the 
serum toxicity analysis. Finally, human cell lines HaCat and HepG2 were also studied 
for evaluating the cytotoxicity of the degradation product in comparison with the dye.

 CONCLUSION  
The strain Stenotrophomonas koreensis  showed outstanding decolorization of the toxic 
industrial dye malachite green. Dec olorization was caused by the degradation of the dye, 
which was confirmed by UV -Vis, FTIR spectrophotometry, TLC and HPLC results. The 
strain  demonstrated excellent decolorization of malachite green even in plain water as a 
solvent, and the decolorization efficiency could be further increased on optimization of 
some physical parameters or by the addition of cheap, readily available supplements. 
This study undoubtedly reports one of the most effective dye decolorizations, biological 
or otherwise, documented to date. The biodegradation follows first -order reaction 
kinetics. Tyrosinase, MG reductase, and NADH -DCIP reductase enzymes facilitate the 
degradation process. S. koreensis  can also decolorize methyl orange, an azo dye with an 
entirely different structure  and chemical nature from the triphenylmethane malachite 
green. The strain remains active in the presence of heavy metals like cadmium, 
chromium, lead, and arsenic, which are commonly prevalent in industrial effluents. 
Stenotrophomonas koreensis  may be exc eptionally functional for treating tannery or 
textile effluents which usually contain mixtures of different dyes and heavy metals. The 
strain could be immobilized into reusable PVA -sodium alginate beads to facilitate easier 
handling. The degradation produc ts were subjected to toxicological testing (according to 
the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals) with a wide variety of organisms 
belonging to the land and aquatic ecosystems, ranging from the prokaryotic unicellular 
bacteria to higher animals like m ice and even human cell lines. Hence, the 
ecotoxicological studies confirmed that the bacterially degraded dye product was 
significantly safer than the untreated dye. Hence, S. koreensis  can become the ideal tool 
for bioremediating dye -contaminated effluen ts and combating industrial dye pollution, 
although further investigations on the scale -up are required.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Biosorption is the adsorption of dye by biological agents and is gaining popularity to 
reduce environmental pollution (Johari et al., 2013). Removal of dyes by biosorption can 
be performed by several agents like bacteria, fungi, algae, agricultural wastes, 
polysaccharides, etc. Biorenewable materials like cellulose, the most abundantly 
available natural polymer, have been used as a biosorbent (Thakur, Thakur and Gupta, 
2014). Microbial biomass is more effective than macroscopic materials  like seaweeds, 
crab shells, etc., as far as the removal of dyes through adsorption is concerned. This 
difference in adsorption behavior may be due to the cell wall constituents and the 
functional groups of the bacteria or fungi (Saravanan et al., 2013). M icroorganisms have 
a high surface -to-volume ratio and thus offer a larger contact area for the interaction of 
the dye molecules and the cell wall. Again, compared to yeast and fungi, bacteria have 
been reported more frequently to exhibit faster growth and higher adaptability to extreme 
conditions of pH, temperature, nutrient availability, etc. (Chen et al., 2007). Biosorption 
by bacteria is mediated by electrostatic forces and chemical reactions between the dye 
and the binding sites.   Remazol Brilliant Blu e R, an anthraquinone dye, is a potent toxic 
organo -pollutant and is frequently used as the precursor of many other dyes (Mechichi et 
al., 2006) . It is one of the most frequently utilized dyes in the textile industry (Ada et al., 
2009).  Dichomitus squalens , Trametes trogii (Eichlerová et al., 2005),  Pleurotus 
calyptratus and Ischnoderma resinosum have been reported to degrade RBBR (Saratale 
et al., 2009).

MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Dyes and media  
Remazol Brilliant Blue R dye was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Nutrient Broth (NB) 
[HM Peptone B (1.5g/L), Yeast extract (1.5g/L), NaCl (5g/L), Peptone (5g/L), pH 7] and 
nutrient agar [Peptone (10g/L), Meat extract B (10g/L), Sodium chloride (5g/L), Agar 
(12g/L), pH 7.3], purchased from HiMedia Laboratories w ere used for the isolation of 
bacteria. Minimal Salt Medium (MSM) [(NH 4)2HPO 4 (0.72g/L), MgSO 4.7H 20 
(0.144g/L), FeSO 4.7H 2O (0.0072g/L), K 2HPO 4 (1.8g/L), KCL (0.144g/L), Sucrose 
(7.2g/L), MnSO 4.7H 2O (0.00504g/L), Na 2HPO 4 (1.8g/L), pH 7] was used for the 
screening and other experiments.  
Decolorisation experiments  
100 ml nutrient broth was inoculated with a loopful of the selected bacterial strains 
individually and incubated at 37ºC for 48h. After completion of the incubation period, 
5ml culture was added to  50 ml MSM amended with 20mg/L RBBR.   Flasks were 
incubated for ten days at 37 °C and pH 7. Aliquots (4ml) were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 
for 15 min to pellet out the biomass. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 
592nm using UV -Vis spectropho tometer (Agilent Cary 60) at regular intervals. 
Uninoculated MSM amended with 20mg/L RBBR was kept as control.  
  
The following equation was used to determine the decolorisation efficiency in terms of 
percentage decolorisation as indicated in Chapter 2. For  convenience of the read ers it is

 Effect of different physical parameters on dye adsorption  
The effects of d ifferent physical parameters (pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, 
and biomass concentration) on the adsorption of RBBR by the selected strain P24 were 
studied.  
Initial biomass concentration  
The initial biomass required for efficient adsorptive de colorisation of RBBR was 
evaluated. Biomass (6, 15, 24, 30, 39 and 45 mg) was added to 100mL MSM amended 
with RBBR (20mg/L) and incubated for 240h at 37 ºC. After completion of the 
incubation period, the adsorptive dye decolorisation was evaluated by the m ethod 
explained. The most suitable inoculum size was chosen for all subsequent studies.  
Initial dye concentration  
To evaluate the effect of initial dye concentration on the adsorptive decolorisation 
efficiency of the strain, 100ml MSM was amended with vary ing RBBR concentrations 
(25, 35, 45, 75 and 100mg/L) and was inoculated with 30mg B.rigiliprofundi  biomass 
and incubated at 37 ºC. Adsorptive decolorisation was noted after 240h, according to the 
procedure mentioned above.  
pH 
The effect of varying pH on th e adsorptive decolorisation of RBBR (25mg/L) was 
studied by inoculating 100ml dye -amended MSM with 30mg biomass. The range of pH 
studied varied from acidic (4.5) to alkaline (10.5). Adsorptive decolorisation conditions 
were the same as mentioned in the abo ve tests.   
Temperature  
To estimate the effect of temperature, 100 ml MSM amended with 25mg/L RBBR was 
inoculated with 30mg biomass and incubated at temperatures varying between 10 ºC to 
60ºC for 240h . Adsorptive decolorisation was estimated after the compl etion of the 
incubation period by methods and conditions menti oned in the above experiments . 
Effect of RBBR on the growth profile  
The growth of the strain was studied in the presence of RBBR (25mg/L) and compared 
with its growth in dye -less MSM (control) . A 24h culture of the strain was inoculated 
into 200ml media at a 1% level and incubated at 37ºC. Aliquots were extracted and the    
140 
 viable cell count  was determined by counting the number of Colony -Forming -Units on a 
solid nutrient agar medium at regular in tervals.  
 
Kinetics of adsorption  
The actual amount of the adsorbed dye can be evaluated only on reaching equilibrium, 
which is why it is vital to study the kinetics of adsorption and estimate the time required 
to attain equilibrium (Sahoo & Prelot, 2020). Kinetic studies were performed by mixing 
30mg biomass with 100ml MSM amended with RBBR (25 mg/L) at pH 5.5 and 
temperature 40ºC for 264h. Aliquots were withdrawn from the mixture at regular 
intervals (24h) and centrifuged at 10000rpm for 15min. The rate of  dye removal was 
evaluated by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 590nm. The amount of dye 
adsorbed (q e) by the bacterial biomass at equilibrium was estimated according to the 
mass balance equation:  
qe=(C0−Ct)V
M  
Equation 4.1  
Where C 0 and C t are the initial and final concentrations of RBBR (mg/L) in the solution, 
respectively after time t, V is the volume (L) of the solution, and M is the biomass (g) of 
the bacteria used.  
Pseudo -first order and pseudo -second order models were investig ated for determining 
the adsorption kinetics. The pseudo first order kinetics is given by the Lagergren 
equation (Lagergren, 1898):  
dqt
dt=k1(qe−qt) 
Equation 4.2  
Where q e is the amount of RBBR adsorbed at equilibrium per unit weight of the bacteria 
(mg g-1),  
qt is the amount of RBBR adsorbed at time t (mg g-1), 
k1 is the pseudo -first order rate constant (hr-1) 
Integrating Equation 4.2 with the  following conditions as q t=0 to q t=qt at t=0 to t=t, the 
final equation can be expressed as:  
log(qe−qt)=logqe−k1t
2.303 
Equation 4.3     
141 
 When log (q e-qt) versus time t is plotted, the pseudo first order rate constant k 1 can be 
obtained from t he slope of the graph.  
The pseudo -second order model is denoted by the following equation (Ho and McKay, 
1999):  
dqt
dt=k2(qe−qt)2 
Equation 4.4  
Integrating Equation 4.4 with the conditions, q t = 0 to q t = qe and  t = 0 to t  = t, the linear 
form can be obtained as below:  
t
qt=1
k2qe2+t/qe   
Equation 4.5  
Where k 2 is the pseudo -second order rate constant (gmg-1hr-1) 
When t/q t is plotted versus time t, the pseudo -second order rate constant can be obtained 
from the slope of the graph.  
 
Adsorption isotherms  
Adsorption isotherm analysis was performed by inoculating 100ml MSM amended with 
RBBR ( 5, 10, 25, 45 and 75 mg/L ) with 30mg biomass at pH 5.5 and temperature 40ºC. 
Two types of adsorption isotherms were studied:  
a) Langmuir Iso therm (1918):  
Ce
qe=1
klqm+Ce
qm 
Equation 4.6  
 
Where k l is the Langmuir isotherm constant (mLmg-1) and q m is the maximum amount of 
the dye adsorbed (mgg-1) 
b) Freundlich Isotherm (1906):  
lnqe=lnkf+1
nlnCe 
Equation 4.7  
 
Where K f is the constant of Freundlich isotherm (mLmg-1) and n is the adsorption 
constant.

 SEM and FTIR Analysis  
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)   
100 ml MSM amended with RBBR (25mg/L) was inoculated with 30mg bacterial 
biomass and incubated at 40ºC, pH 5 .5 for 240h. The biomass was then harvested by 
centrifugation at 10000rpm for 8min. The pellet was collected and fixed with 4% (v/v) 
glutaraldehyde and serially dehydrated using ethanol. Dehydrated samples were air -dried 
and mounted on SEM stubs. The sampl es were then gold -coated. Bacterial cells without 
RBBR were prepared likewise and kept as the control for comparison. Morphological 
and surface changes were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using Zeiss 
EVO LS 10.  
 
Fourier transform infrared sp ectroscopy (FTIR)  
30 mg bacterial biomass was added to 100 ml RBBR -amended (25mg/L)  MSM under 
optimized conditions (temperature 40ºC , pH 5.5) for 240h. After incubation, the biomass 
was separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 8min. The pellets thus ob tained were 
dried before the FTIR studies. Bacterial samples prepared in the same way in the absence 
of dye were considered as the control. FTIR analysis was performed  in the spectral range 
of 500 to 4500 cm-1 before and after RBBR adsorption to identify t he functional groups 
of the dye that were on the bacterial surface. Measurements were carried out using an 
FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker Alpha model, USA) in the absorbance mode.  
 
Phytotoxicity study  
100mL RBBR dye solution (25mg/L) was inoculated with 3 0mg bacterial biomass and 
incubated at 40ºC, pH 5.5 for ten days. Phytotoxicity of the resultant solution was 
studied. High -yield variety rice seeds ( Oryza sativa var. IET 4786) were procured from 
the Rice Research Institute, Chinsurah, West Bengal, India.  The seeds were placed 
equidistantly in sterile Petri plates lined with two Whatman filter papers soaked in the 
untreated RBBR and the solution obtained after the bacterial treatment. Two essential 
parameters, i.e., germination percentage and seedling leng ths, were considered for 
evaluating the phytotoxicity. Germination was monitored on the third, fifth, and seventh 
days. Seeds in which radical emerged were considered germinated. Root lengths and 
shoot lengths were measured on the 14th day. 
    
143 
  
Cytotoxicity Study  
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were suspended in  RPMI 1640 media 
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 2% Penicillin -Streptomycin. The 
cells were cultivated in T -15 flasks until they were 80% confluent. After transferring 2 
ml of PBMC suspensions into each tube, 50µL of the untreated RBBR (25 mg/L) and the 
bacterially treated RBBR were applied. For 24 hours, the tubes were incubated at 37°C 
in the presence of 5% CO2. The MTT assay was then used to calculate the percentage of 
live and dead cells in various test samp les by measuring absorbance at 5 90 nm .

 RESULT S AND DISCUSSION  
 
Decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R by  Bacillus rigiliprofundi  
Remazol Brilliant Blue R solution (20mg/L) in distilled water was subjected to 5mL 
culture of B. rigiliprofundi  and decolorization was observed intermittently. Nearly 7 0% 
decolorization was recorded at 168h (7days). Decolorization gradually increased to 73% 
at the end of 264 h (11 days) (Figure 4.1). The decolorisation increased linearly till the 
seventh day and subsequently reached saturation. No additional supplement h ad been 
added in the decolorization medium. This is the first report of B. rigiliprofundi 
decolorizing Remazol Brilliant Blue R.  
 
Figure 4.1 Remazol Brilliant Blue R decolorisation profile of Bacillus rigiliprofundi  
 
Only a few RBBR degrading strains of fungi have been reported to date, which may be 
due to the highly recalcitrant nature of the dye. Ligninolytic enzymes from some tropical 
Brazilian basidiomycetes fungi capable of RBBR decolorisation were reported by 
Machado et al (2005). Trametes hirsuta  was reported to decolorise 91% of 25mg/L 
RBBR, in 15 days (Bibi and Bhatti, 2012). Trichoderma citriniviridae  and Pestalotiopsis 
sp. perform enzymatic degradation of RBBR (initial dye concentration 50mg/L) to an 
extent of 80.9% and 87.2% respectively in 14 days under glucose -supplemented 
conditions. Biological adsorption is a cost -effective method to reduce the presence of 
water -soluble dyes in textile and tannery effluents. Natural or processed plant parts, 
fungi and bacteria effectively adsorb and remove d ye from the solution. The adsorption 
   
145 
 of RBBR on pinang frond -based activated carbon was reported by Ahmad et al (2014). 
Pomegranate -fruit-peel activated carbon was used for the adsorptive removal of RBBR 
(81.35% adsorptive decolorisation, initial dye conce ntration 25mg/L) from synthetic 
wastewater (Ahmad et al, 2020).  Apart from these, watermelon rind, mangosteen peel, 
etc. have also been used to produce activated carbon for the adsorptive removal of RBBR 
(Ahmad et al, 2015; Ahmad and Alrozi, 2010). Kulkarn i et al (2018) used water hyacinth 
root powder to adsorb and remove RBBR. Syafiuddin & Fulazzaky (2021) reported 
adsorptive removal of RBBR by  Trichoderma koningiopsis . Barreda -Reyes et al (2015) 
reported the use of yeast biomass to perform adsorptive remo val of RBBR. Scenedesmus 
quadricauda , green algae,  was immobilized in alginate gel beads and used for adsorptive 
removal of RBBR by Ergene et al (2009).  
Pellets obtained on centrifuging the decolorised medium after bacterial treatment (by 
methods describe d earlier) took up the bright blue color of the RBBR dye, indicating that 
the bacterial biomass had adsorbed the dye (Figure 4.2).  
 
Figure 4.2 Bright blue cell pellets obtained after dye removal from the medium, 
indicating the adsorption of  RBBR on the ba cterial biomass  
Saputra et al. (2017) report that the adsorptive removal of RBBR using amino -
functionalised organosilane. A cross -linked chitosan -glyoxal/kaolin clay composite was 
used by Jawad et al (2021) for adsorptive removal of RBBR. Diethyl triamine  
functionalized magnetic macro -reticular hybrid material exhibited sorptive removal of 
RBBR (Elwakeel et al, 2016). A macroporous polystyrene resin was used to perform 
adsorptive removal of RBBR by Ozturk and Silah (2020). Borax cross -linked Jhingan 
gum hy drogel could remove RBBR from water (Mate and Mishra, 2020). Reghioua et al 
   
146 
 (2021) synthesized and used a magnetic chitosan -glutaraldehyde/zinc 
oxide/Fe 3O4 nanocomposite for adsorptive decolorisation of RBBR.  
 
Effect of different physical parameters on dy e adsorption  
The key parameters (pH, temperature, inoculum size, and initial biomass) influencing 
dye adsorption were studied. Biosorption experiments were carried out with six different 
biomass ( 6, 15, 24, 30, 39 and 45 mg) at five different pH (4.5, 5.5,  7.5, 8.5 and 10.5) 
and at five different temperature (10ºC, 30ºC, 40ºC, 50ºC, and 60ºC) for five different 
initial RBBR concentrations (5 , 10, 25, 30, 50 and 75 mg/L).  
Effect of biomass on biosorption  
Figure 4.3a illustrates the effect of inoculum size i n terms of biomass on the adsorption 
of RBBR by B.rigiliprofundi . When 6mg biomass was used, only 28% adsorptive 
decolorisation was observed. An increase in adsorptive decolorisation was recorded on 
increasing the biomass upto 30mg (80.5% adsorptive decolo risation). This observation 
indicates that an increase in biomass increases biosorption of the dye. Further increase in 
biomass did not affect the biosorption of RBBR by B.rigiliprofundi . As a result of the 
increase in biomass or biosorbent surface area, t he number of functional groups involved 
in the biosorption process effectively increases till saturation is achieved (Hamzeh, 
2012). Adsorption improves when the adsorbent's surface area becomes more accessible.  
Effect of dye concentration on biosorption  
The effect of RBBR concentration on the biosorption ability of the strain is presented in 
Figure 4.3b. Adsorptive decolorisation decreased with the increase in RBBR 
concentration. While more than 83.45% adsorptive decolorisation was observed for 
25mg/L dye , it was reduced to only about 15.55% for 100mg/L RBBR concentration. 
This might happen because, at higher dye concentrations, excess dye molecules are 
present compared to the binding sites available on the bacterial biomass. Similar 
observations were repo rted in case of adsorptive removal of the azo dye Remazol Black 
by Sarocladium sp. ( Nouri et al, 2020)  
Effect of pH on biosorption  
pH is one of the most important factors which determines the efficiency of biosorption 
(Aksu et al., 2005). The impact of pH on biosorption was investigated and an optimum 
pH for adsorptive decolorisation was selected (Figure 4.3c). Highest adsorptive    
147 
 decolorisation (82%) was recorded at pH 5.5. At more alkaline pH, adsorptive 
decolorisation decreased significantly: only about 1 6% adsorptive decolorisation was 
observed at pH 10.5. The bacterial cell wall shows variable susceptibility to the pH of the 
medium which leads to differences in pollutant biosorption (Ozturk et al. 2020). 
Optimum pH for dye removal varies significantly fr om species to species and from dye 
to dye. At low pH, the number of positively charged adsorption sites increases, making 
binding the anionic dye RBBR more feasible. On the other hand, adsorbent surfaces 
accumulate negative charges at high pH, reducing ads orption efficacy due to repulsion 
(Ozcan & Ozcan, 2004; Nouri et al. 2020). Rhodopseudomonas palustris 51ATA showed 
maximum azo dye Fast black K removal at optimal pH 8 (Öztürk et al. 2020). Periphytic 
biofilms show Methyl orange adsorption in a wide range  of pH and optimal dye removal 
is observed in the pH range 5 -9 (Wu 2016). 92.4% bio removal of azo dye direct violet at 
a highly acidic condition (pH 2) was reported by Abd El -Rahim et al (2009).  
Effect of temperature on biosorption  
The most favorable tem perature range for biosorption of RBBR by B. rigiliprofundi  was 
found to be between 30ºC to 40ºC (Figure 4.3d). The highest adsorptive decolorisation 
(more than 82%) was achieved at 40ºC which reduced to only 18% at 60ºC. Physical 
biosorption has been more  efficient at lower temperatures (Abbas and Trari, 2015). 
Temperature can affect the stability and configuration of the bacterial cell wall, thereby 
ionizing the chemical moieties and the binding sites of the cell surfaces (Kalamdhad & 
Kazmi, 2009). At hig her temperatures, the bonds between the cell surface and the dye 
may break, causing desorption (Asku 2005, Gadd 2009). Several bacterial strains have 
been reported to exhibit optimal dye adsorption at temperatures ranging from 30ºC to 
40ºC. The highest bio removal of methyl red by Lysinibacillus fusiformis  was recorded at 
30ºC (Sari & Simarani 2019). Pseudomonas putida  showed maximum dye adsorption at 
37ºC.

Growth profile of B. rigiliprofundi  in presence and absence of RBBR  
The growth pattern was investigated by growing the organisms in the presence of dye 
and comparing them to the dye -less control (Figure 4.4). The presence of 25mg/L RBBR 
dye in the media extended the lag phase of the bacteria. The bacteria adapt to their 
environment and prepare for exponential growth during the lag phase. The bacteria 
required a more prolonged lag phase to adapt to the dye -rich growth media. Exponenti al 
growth initiated after 24 hours in the absence of RBBR and 48 hours in the presence of 
the dye RBBR. The highest viable cell count in the dye -free medium was greater 
(Log 10(CFU/ml)=8.9) than in the dye -rich medium (Log 10(CFU/ml)=8.4). Hence it can 
be co ncluded that although the growth was initially slower, B. rigiliprofundi  could adapt 
to and overcome the toxicity of the dye.

Kinetics of adsorption   
The te rm "sorption" refers to attaching a substance to a surface that results in an 
interaction. Sorption can be classified as physical, chemical, or electrostatic, depending 
on the type of interaction between the sorbent and the sorbate. The kinetic model 
follo wed by a biosorption system can predict the rate of adsorption of dye on the surface 
of the bacteria and can also provide valuable information on adsorption pathways and the 
mechanisms that may be involved. Since the R2 value of pseudo -first order kinetics  
(0.98) was higher than that of the pseudo -second order kinetics (0.94), it was concluded 
that the pseudo -first order kinetics is more appropriately applicable. Adsorption is 
typically reported to occur via physisorption or diffusion through the interface when a 
biosorption system follows the Lagergren pseudo first -order rate equation (Ferreiro et al. 
2019, Sahoo and Prelot, 2020). In physisorption, the adsorbate adheres to the surface via 
weak van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, or electrostatic attrac tion (Sahoo & 
Prelot, 2020) . The rate of sorption site occupation is proportional to the number of vacant 
sites for systems that follow the pseudo -first order kinetics (Salam, 2013). This is 
reflected in the phenomenon that during the initial stages of ads orption, there are 
abundant vacant sites on the bacterial cells, and thus the dye molecules are rapidly taken 
up from the media; however, during the later phases, the number of vacant sites for dye 
adsorption is effectively reduced, resulting in a slower r ate of dye -adsorption. The rate 
constants were calculated and have been presented in Table 4.1. The pseudo -first order 
kinetics of RBBR adsorption by the bacteria is shown in Figure 4.5.

 Adsorption isotherms  
Adsorption isotherms indicate the interaction pathway between the  adsorbate and the 
adsorbent. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes that the surface of the adsorbent is 
covered by a monolayer of the adsorbate and adsorption takes place at specific 
homogeneous sites. In contrast to the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model  allows 
multilayer adsorption (Aurich, 1906) and heterogeneous energetic distribution of active 
sites (Ozturk et al, 2020; Nouri et al, 2020). The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms of 
RBBR adsorption on  Bacillus rigiliprofundi are presented in Table 4.2. T he best fit 
generated following the Langmuir and Freundlich models is shown in Figure 4.6. Results 
indicate that the biosorption of RBBR on B. rigiliprofundi  fits the Langmuir isotherm 
more appropriately since the R2 value of the Langmuir isotherm model (0 .99) was 
greater than that of the Freundlich model (0.86). The maximum adsorption capacity (q m) 
of B. rigiliprofundi  was 57.803 mgg-1.

FTIR Analysis  
 
Adsorption is a surface phenomenon and hence knowledge about the existing functional 
groups is essential. This also provides evidence  of adsorption of dye on the bacterial 
surface. FTIR spectrum of the bacterial surface before and after dye adsorption (Figure 
4.7) was studied. The enolic OH of quinones causes a peak at 3100 cm-1 in the FTIR 
spectrum  of RBRR . It does not appear in the FT IR spectra of bacteria, but a peak at 3100 
cm-1 in the spectrum of RBRR -bound bacteria confirms the presence of enolic OH of 
quinones, which could be attributed  to the adsorbed RBRR on the bacterial  surface. 
Again a peak at 681 cm-1  present in RBRR may be  due to the C -S stretching which is 
absent in the bacteria. After adsorption of RBRR, the dye -bound bacteria gives a peak at 
681 cm-1 confirming the presence of C -S stretching (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2017) . 
Similarly, a peak at 913  cm-1 indicates SO 3 stretching which is very prominent in RBRR 
but absent in the bacterial surfaces. In RBRR -adsorbed bacteria, this signature peak at 
913 cm-1 indicates the presence of SO 3 due to adsorption of RBRR on to bacterial surface 
   
153 
 (Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2017) .  A peak at 564  cm-1 is present in RBRR may be due to 
the presence of Na in the RBRR structure as aryl halides give peak in this range. This 
peak is absent in the bacterial FTIR spectrum. However, it appears prominently in 
RBRR -bound bacteria. Likewise, a peak at 1655  cm-1  in the bacterial spectrum may be 
due to C=O stretching of ester groups present on their surfaces which again is present in 
RBRR -bound bacteria but absent in the dye itself. In the bacterial spectrum, a small 
hump can be observed around 3200 -3400 cm-1, which may be due to the N -H stretching 
of amines of proteins present on the bacterial surface. The smaller humps corresponding 
to reduced intensity around 3400 -3600  cm-1 may be due to the OH stretching of alcoholic 
groups on the bacterial surface . A prominent hump in the region of 3200 -3600  cm-1 in 
the RBRR spectrum may be due to N -H stretching. In the RBRR -bound bacterial 
spectrum, the presence of all these groups was confirmed by the presence of similar peak 
and humps. The peaks at 1000  cm-1 and 1200  cm-1 designates the N -H stretching of NH 2 
present in both the dye and the bacteria and these common peaks are also present in the 
RBRR -bound bacteria ( Srinivasaraghavan et al., 2017) . Similarly, the peaks around 700 -
800 cm-1 corresponding to aromatic  rings and those at 2800  cm-1 and 2900 cm-1 
corresponding to the CH symmetric and asymmetric stretching of CH 2, respectively, are 
present in all three spectra ( Fanchiang and Tseng, 2009).

SEM analysis  
 
Scanning electron microscopy is widely used to study the morphological features as well 
as topological or surface characteristics of adsorbent material. SEM images of the 
bacteria before and after adsorption o f the dye are represented in Figure 4.8. Before 
adsorption (Figure 4.8a), the bacteria are visible as rod -shaped cells with smooth and 
regular surfaces. After biosorption of the dye, significant changes in the surface 
characteristics could be observed. The  cell surfaces appeared rough, wrinkled, with a 
visible coating, indicating the deposition of the dye molecules (Figure 4.8b).

Phytotoxicit y 
Table 4.3 and 4.4 represent germination percentage and root length and shoot length 
respectively as a measure of phytotoxicity of RBBR before and after treatment on Oryza 
sativa  var. IET 4786.  It can be observed that at the end of seven days, germinatio n has 
taken place in very low frequency (about 5%) in the seeds soaked in the untreated 
RBBR, whereas, higher rate of emergence of radical ( about 68%) can be seen in the 
seeds soaked in the treated dye solution. At the end of fourteen days, the rice seedl ings 
grown in untreated RBBR show shorter root and shoot lengths than those grown in 
RBBR treated with the bacteria. The RBBR -grown rice seedling is also visibly deficient 
in chlorophyll pigments (Figure 4.9).

RBBR has been reported to show prominen t phytotoxicity by many authors . In general, it 
delays and lowers the rate of germination and results  in stunted growth of early 
seedlings. The concentration of the dye is directly proportional to the phytotoxicity 
elicited (Velayutham et al., 2018; Osma et al., 2010). The result of the phytotoxicity 
analysis was in line with the previous works and it was  observed that reduction in the 
   
156 
 concentration of the dye (brought about by the bacterial treatment) resulted  in lowering 
the phytotoxicity.  
 
Cytotoxicity   
 
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear (PBM) cell lines were used to test the toxicity of dye solutions  by 
MTT  assay . In toxicology, the MTT assay is a well -known and well accepted method for 
studying cellular responses to toxicants. It has the ability to provide data on cell death, survival, 
and metabolic processes.  Reduction of toxicity after bacterial treatment  of the dye is clearly 
indicated by the significantly greater viability of the PBMC from the original dye as (Figure 
4.10). More than 80% cells remained viable in presence of the bacterially treated RBBR, 
indicating its ecological biocompatibility.  
 
 
Figu re 4.10 % viability of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells after exposure to 
treated and untreated RBBR  
The anthraquinone dye RBBR has significant cytotoxic effect on different animal and human cell 
lines. RBBR was cytotoxic to the Human Dermal Fibroblast ( HDF) cell line (40% cell viability), 
but treatment with fungus Trametes hirsuta significantly reduced the cytotoxicity and the cell 
viablilty increased to 90% . Other cell lines, such as murine muscle cells (C2C12) and dog kidney 
cells (MDCK)  showed a simil ar patter n [Alam et al., 2021] . The results of the cytotoxicity 
investigation were consistent with earlier studies, and it was observed that lowering the dye 
concentration (due to bacterial treatment) resulted in lower cytotoxicity.

CONCLUSION  
 
Bacterial cell walls include functional groups that interact with the environment and, as a 
result, can adsorb ions; the type of cell wall components regulates the quantity and 
exposure of these groups.  Although multiple bacteria have been reported to adsorb 
various  dyes, no Bacillus  strain has yet been identified to remove RBBR via adsorption, 
making this work the first report of B.rigiliprofundi  to remove RBBR via adsorption. 
Since no further processing or supplementation is required, the novel bacterial strain 
Bacillus rigiliprofundi  can be considered as a convenient and cost -effective means of 
adsorptive removal of the hazardous, recalcitrant dye RBBR .

165 
 The strain s Stenotrophomonas koreensis  and Bacillus rigili profundi  isolated from textile 
effluents and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing were able to decolorise the toxic 
industrial dyes Malachite green and Remazol Brilliant Blue by degradation and 
adsorption respectively.  
The strain Stenotrophomonas koreensis  showed upto 98.78 % decolorisation of malachite 
green under optimised conditions within one hour of inoculation.  Decolorisation was 
caused as a result of degradation of the dye, as confirmed by UV -Vis and FTIR 
spectrophotometr y and TLC and HPLC. S. koreensis  demonstrated excellent 
decolorisation (95% in 1hr) of malachite green in plain distilled water in presence of 
only one nitrogen supplement, peptone or soymeal extract (1g/L), This can be 
undoubtedly described as one of the fastest decolorisations reported  till date. It remains 
active in presence of some heavy metals and is also capable to decolorise methyl orange, 
which is an azo dye, obviously having a completely different structure and chemical 
nature from the triphenylmethane dye malachite green. S.kore ensis  can be immobilised 
into re -usable PVA -sodium alginate beads to facilitate easier handling . The enzymes 
responsible for the degradation of malachite green in S.koreensis  were tyrosinase, MG -
reductase and NADH -DCIP reductase. The degradation  products w ere subjected to 
toxicological testing (according to the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals) with a 
wide variety of organisms, ranging from the prokaryotic unicellular bacteria to higher 
animals like mi ce and also in human cell lines . From the elabor ate ecotoxicological 
studies performed with the r epresentative organisms of the k ey levels of the ecosystem, it 
can be ascertained that the final products of malachite green decolorisation by this strain 
was significantly safe for release in the environmen t. Hence, overall, Stenotrophomonas 
koreensis  is an extremely promising bioresource which can be utilized to bioremediate 
malachite green efficiently.  
Bacillus rigiliprofiundi was able to bioadsorb more than 80% of the toxic dye Remazol 
Brilliant blue. No chemical treatment or complex procedure needed to be followed for 
the adsorptive removal of the dye, however, optimisation of some physical parameters 
could lead to better results.  
In this quest, it was established that bacteria can be an ideal solution fo r combating the 
dye pollution globally, replacing the expensive, and hazardous  conventional treatment 
procedures .
