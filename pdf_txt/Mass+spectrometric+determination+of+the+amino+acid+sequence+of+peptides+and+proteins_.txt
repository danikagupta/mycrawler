of the oligopeptide products. The sequence of amino acids in these pep-

for the molecular ion by adding the exact mass of the esbr group 43 to 
the mss of the identified chain, 4. f 
A fit then establishes the molecular 
size, and the identification is complete. 
For some larger peptides neither a peak corresponding to the next 
amino acid by paths A or B nor one corresponding to the addition of -OR is 
fond. In these cases a check for a molecular ion at higher mass is made 
using the sum of An f OR + each of the amino acid fragment' msses (lk3ls ZL) . 
A similar sequence determination can be attempted from the ;-terminaland 
using the ester fragments, making possible the structure elucidation of pep-

Further investigation to elucidate this anomsly is currently in progress. 
However, the effect does not appear to be unique to our esterification 
procedure, as compound N was swpplied to us as the niethyl ester. Esteri- 
Zication of compound V was repeated using the same procedure, but with'the 
sukstitution of ChOD for CQOH. The B3 sequence peak at mass 464 (Y-pro- P.

-t. 2.2 mu), and the (M + 14). at mass 642 is increased in mass to correspond .

As an example of the value of high resolution, comsoundy gives a sub- 
stantial peak at dz 465, whose noaim1 mass could indicate the expected ' 
CY&O-his-rnet-aspOC&- (no extra methyl group on the histidine). Eowever, 
the exact miss measurement of the peak disagrees with that expected for this 
ion by 14 mu; the elemn-lal composition actually corresponds to the loss 
of CaE& from the molecdar ion of the peptide containing the additional 
CH2.
