New-onset epilepsy in the elderly:  
Challenges for the internist
Contrary to the popular belief that ep-
ilepsy is mainly a disease of youth, nearly 
25% of new-onset seizures occur after age 65.1,2 
The incidence of epilepsy in this age group is almost twice the rate in children, and in peo-ple over age 80, it is triple the rate in children.
3 
As our population ages, the burden of “elderly-onset” epilepsy will rise. 
See related editorial, page 499
 A seizure diagnosis carries significant im -
plications in older people, who are already vul-nerable to cognitive decline, loss of functional independence, driving restrictions, and risk of falls. Newly diagnosed epilepsy further worsens quality of life.
4
 The causes and clinical manifestations of  
seizures and epilepsy in the elderly differ from those in younger people.
5 Hence, it is often dif-
ficult to make a diagnosis with certainty from a wide range of differential diagnoses. Older people are also more likely to have comorbidi-ties, further complicating the situation.
 Managing seizures in the elderly is also chal
-
lenging, as age-associated physiologic changes can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharma-codynamics of antiepileptic drugs. Diagnosing and managing elderly-onset epilepsy can be challenging for a family physician, an internist, a geriatrician, or even a neurologist. 
 In 
this review, we emphasize the common 
causes of new-onset epilepsy in the elderly and the assessment of the clinical clues that are es-sential for making an accurate diagnosis. We also review the pharmacology of antiepileptic drugs used in old age and highlight the need for psychological support for patients and care-givers.
doi:10.3949/ccjm.81a.13148ABSTRACT
New-onset epilepsy in the elderly is difficult to diagnose, 
owing to atypical presentation, concomitant cognitive im-pairment, similarities with other common disorders, and nonspecific changes on electroencephalography (EEG). Its management is also challenging because of its deranging physiology, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Antiepilep-tic drugs must be carefully chosen and closely monitored. Support of the patient and caregiver is key.
KEY POINTS
About 25% of new-onset seizures occur after the age of 65.
Most new-onset cases of epilepsy in the elderly are sec-
ondary to cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, dementia, traumatic brain injury, tumor, or drug therapy.
The diagnosis is challenging and can be confused with 
syncope, transient ischemic attack, cardiac arrhythmia, metabolic disturbances, transient global amnesia, neuro-degenerative disease, rapid-eye-movement sleep behav-ior disorder, and psychogenic disorders.
The clinical presentation of seizures in the elderly differs 
from that in younger patients.
A detailed clinical history, blood tests, electrocardiogra-
phy, magnetic resonance imaging, and EEG can be helpful in diagnosing.
No single drug is ideal for new-onset epilepsy in the 
elderly; the choice depends mainly on the type of seizure and the comorbidities present.CREDITCME

In US Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, 
the average annual incidence rate of epilepsy in 2001 to 2005 was 10.8 per 1,000.
6 A large 
study in Finland revealed falling incidence rates of epilepsy in childhood and middle age and rising trends in the elderly.
7
 In the United States, the rates are higher 
in African Americans (18.7 per 1,000) and lower in Asian Americans and Native Ameri-cans (5.5 and 7.7 per 1,000) than in whites (10.2 per 1,000).
6 Incidence rates are slightly 
higher for women than for men and increase with age in both sexes and all racial groups.
 Acute symptomatic seizure is also common
 
in older patients. The incidence of acute sei-zures in patients over age 60 was estimated at 50 to 100 per 100,000 per year in one study.
7 
The rate was considerably higher in men than in women. The study also found a 3.6% risk of experiencing an acute symptomatic seizure in an 80-year lifespan, which approaches that of developing epilepsy.
8 The major causes of acute 
symptomatic seizure were traumatic brain in-jury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, and central nervous system infection.
 ■CA
USES OF NEW-ONSET EPILEPSY  
IN THE ELDERLY
The most common causes of new-onset epi-lepsy in the elderly include cerebrovascular disease, metabolic disturbances, dementia, traumatic brain injury, tumors, and drugs.
3,9–11
Cerebrovascular diseaseIn older adults, acute stroke is the most com-mon cause, accounting for up to half of cases.
5,12 
 Seizures occur in 4.4% to 8.9% of acute
 
cerebrovascular events.13,14 The risk varies by 
stroke subtype, although all stroke subtypes, including transient ischemic attack, can be as-sociated with seizure.
15 For example, although 
1% to 2% of patients experienced a seizure within 15 days of a transient ischemic attack or a lacunar infarct, this risk was 16.6% after an embolic stroke.
15 
 Beyond 
this increased risk of “acute sei-
zure” in the immediate poststroke period (usu-ally defined as 1 week), the risk of epilepsy was also 20 times higher in the first year after a stroke.
14 However, seizures tend to occur with-in the first 48 hours after the onset of ischemic 
stroke. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizures generally occur within hours.
16
 In a population-based study in Roches-ter, NY,
17 epilepsy developed in two-thirds of 
patients with seizure related to acute stroke. T wo factors that independently predicted the development of epilepsy were early seizure oc-currence and recurrence of stroke. 
 Interestingly
, the risk of stroke was three 
times higher in older patients who had new-onset seizure.
18 Therefore, any elderly person 
with new-onset seizure should be assessed for cerebrovascular risk factors and treated ac-cordingly for stroke prevention.
Metabolic disturbances
Acute metabolic disorders are common in el-derly patients because of multiple comorbidi-ties and polypharmacy. Hypoglycemia and hy-ponatremia need to be particularly considered in this population.
19 
 Other well-documented metabolic causes
 
of acute seizure, including nonketotic hyper -
glycemia, hypocalcemia, and uremic or hepat-ic encephalopathy, can all be considerations, albeit less specific to this age group.
Dementia
Primary neurodegenerative disorders associ-ated with cognitive impairment, such as Al-zheimer disease, are major risk factors for new-onset epilepsy in older patients.
3,5 Seizures 
occur in about 10% of Alzheimer patients.20 
Those who have brief periods of increased confusion may actually be experiencing un-recognized complex partial seizures.
21 
 A case-control study discovered incidence
 
rates of epilepsy almost 10 times higher in pa-tients who had Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia than in nondemented patients.
22 A 
prospective cohort study in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease established that younger age, a greater degree of cognitive impairment, and a history of antipsychotic use were independent risk factors for new-onset seizures in the elderly.
23 Preexisting dementia 
also increases the risk of poststroke epilepsy.24
Traumatic brain injuryThe most common cause of brain trauma in the elderly is falls. Subdural hematoma, which can occur in the elderly with trivial trauma or Common causes

sidered. The risk of posttraumatic hemorrhage is especially relevant in patients taking anti-coagulants. 
 T
raumatic brain injury has a poorer progno-
sis in older people than in the young,25 and it 
accounts for up to 20% of cases of epilepsy in the elderly.
26 Although no study has specifically 
addressed the longitudinal risk of epilepsy after traumatic brain injury in the elderly, a study in children and young adults revealed the risk was highest in the first year, with the increased risk persisting for more than 10 years.
27
Brain tumorsBetween 10% and 30% of new-onset seizures  in the elderly are associated with tumor, typi-cally glioma, meningioma, and brain metasta-sis.
28,29 Seizures are usually associated more with 
primary than with secondary tumors, and more with low-grade tumors than high-grade ones.
30
Drug-inducedDrugs and drug withdrawal can contribute to up to 10% of acute symptomatic seizures in the geriatric population.
5,8,29 The elderly are sus-
ceptible to drug-induced seizure because of a higher prevalence of polypharmacy, impaired drug clearance, and heightened sensitivity to the proconvulsant side effects of medications.
1 
A number of commonly used drugs have been implicated,
31 including:
 Antibiotics such as carbapenems and
 
high-dose penicillin
 Antihistamines such as desloratadine
 
(Clarinex)
 Pain medications 
such as tramadol (Ul-
tram) and high-dose opiates
 Neuromodulators
 Antidepressants such as clomipramine
 
(Anafranil), maprotiline (Ludiomil), amoxa-pine (Asendin), and bupropion (Wellbutrin).
32 
 Seizures also follow alcohol, benzo
diaz-
epine, and barbiturate withdrawal.33
Other causesParaneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a rare cause of seizures in the elderly.
34 It can pres-
ent with refractory seizures, confusion, and behavioral changes with or without a known concurrent neoplastic disease.
 Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy
 
syndrome, another rare consideration, can particularly affect immunosuppressed elderly 
patients. This syndrome is characterized clini-cally by headache, confusion, seizures, vomit-ing, and visual disturbances with radiographic vasogenic edema.
35
 ■CLINICAL PRESENT ATION
The signs and symptoms of a seizure may be atypical in the elderly. Seizures more often have a picture of “epileptic amnesia,” with confusion, sleepiness, or clumsiness, rather than motor manifestations such as tonic stiff-ening or automatism.
36,37 Postictal states are 
also prolonged, particularly if there is underly-ing brain dysfunction.
38 All these features ren-
der the clinical seizure manifestations more subtle and, as such, more difficult for the un-initiated caregiver to identify.
Convulsive and nonconvulsive  
status epilepticus
Status epilepticus is defined as a single gener -
alized seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or a series of seizures lasting longer than 30 min-utes without the patient’s regaining conscious-ness.
39 The greatest increase in the incidence 
of status epilepticus occurs after age 60.40 It is 
the first seizure in about 30% of new-onset sei-zures in the elderly.
41 
 Mortality rates increase with age, anoxia,
 
and duration of status epilepticus and are over 50% in patients age 80 and older.
40,42
 Convulsive status epilepticus is most 
commonly caused by stroke.40 
 Absence status epilepticus 
can occur in 
elderly patients as a late complication of idio-  
pathic generalized  epilepsy related to benzo-diazepine withdrawal, alcohol intoxication, or initiation of psychotropic drugs.
42 
 Nonconvulsive status epilepticus 
mani-
fests as altered mental status, psychosis, leth-argy, or coma.
42–44 Occasionally, it presents as a 
more focal cognitive disturbance with aphasia or a neglect syndrome.
42,45 Electroencepha-
lographic correlates of nonconvulsive status epilepticus include focal rhythmic discharges, often arising from frontal or temporal lobes, or generalized spike or sharp and slow-wave ac-tivity.
46 Its management is challenging because 
of  delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. The risk of death is higher in patients with severely im-paired mental status or acute complications.

Differential diagnosis of new-onset epilepsy 
in the elderlyNew-onset epilepsy in elderly patients can be confused with syncope, transient ischemic attack, cardiac arrhythmia, metabolic distur -
bances, transient global amnesia, neurode-generative disease, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, psychogenic disorders, and other conditions (
TABLE 2 ). If there is a high 
clinical suspicion of seizure, the patient should undergo electroencephalography (EEG) and be referred to a neurologist or epileptologist.
 ■KEY
S TO THE DIAGNOSIS
Clinical historyA reliable history and description of the event from an eyewitness or a video recording of the event are invaluable to the diagnosis of epi-leptic seizure. Signs and symptoms that sug-gest the diagnosis include aura, ictal pallor, urinary incontinence, tongue-biting, and mo-tor symptoms, as well as postictal confusion, drowsiness, and speech disturbance. 
Electroencephalography
EEG is the most useful diagnostic tool in epi-lepsy. However, an interictal EEG reading (ie, between epileptic attacks) in an elderly pa-tient has limited utility, showing epileptiform activity in only about one-fourth of patients.
49 
Nonspecific EEG abnormalities such as inter -
mittent focal slowing are seen in many older people even without seizure.
50 Also, normal 
findings on outpatient EEG do not rule out epilepsy, as EEG is normal in about one-third of patients with epilepsy, irrespective of age.
1,49 
Activation procedures such as hyperventila-
tion and photic stimulation add little to the diagnosis in the elderly.
49
 On the other hand, video-EEG monitor -
ing is an excellent tool for evaluating possi
-
ble epilepsy, as it allows accurate assessment of brain electrical activity during the events in question. Moreover, studies of video-EEG recording of seizures in elderly patients dem-onstrated epileptiform discharges on EEG in 76% of clinical ictal events.
50 
 Therefore, routine EEG is a useful screen
-
ing tool, and inpatient video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard to characterize events of concern and distinguish between epileptic and nonepileptic or psychogenic seizures.
Other diagnostic studies
Brain imaging, preferably magnetic reso-nance imaging with contrast, should be done in every patient with possible epilepsy due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other struc-tural brain disease.
51 
 Electrocardiography helps exclude cardiac
 
causes such as arrhythmia. 
 Blood testing. 
Metabolically provoked sei-
zure can be distinguished by blood analysis for electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, and drug levels (eg, ethanol). A complete blood cell count with differential and platelets should also be done in anticipation of starting antiepileptic drug therapy. 
 Lumbar puncture 
for cell count, protein, 
glucose, stains, and cultures should be performed whenever meningitis or encephalitis is suspected. Presentation

TING EPILEPSY IN THE ELDERLY
Therapeutic challengesAge-associated changes in drug absorption, protein binding, and distribution in body compartments require adjustments in drug se-lection and dosage. The causes and manifesta-tions of these changes are typically multifac-torial, mainly related to altered metabolism, 
declining plasma albumin concentrations, and increasing competition for protein binding by concomitantly used drugs. 
 The differences in the pharmacokinetics
 
and pharmacodynamics of antiepileptic drugs depend on the patient’s physical status, rel-evant comorbidities, and concomitant medi-cations.
52 Renal and hepatic function may 
decline in an elderly patient; accordingly, pre-caution is needed in the prescribing and dos-ing of antiepileptic drugs. 
 Adverse effects from seizure medications
 
are twice as common in elderly patients com-pared with younger patients. Ataxia, tremor, visual disturbance, and sedation are the most common.

 Elderly patients tend to take multiple  
drugs, and some drugs can lower the seizure threshold, particularly antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and antibiotics.
32 The herbal rem-
edy ginkgo biloba can also precipitate seizure in this population.
54 
 Antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital,
 
primidone (Mysoline), phenytoin (Dilantin), and carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be broad-spectrum enzyme-inducers, increasing the metabolism of many drugs, including warfarin (Coumadin), cytotoxic agents, statins, cardiac antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, cortico-steroids, and other immunosuppressants.
55 For example, carbamazepine can alter the metab-
olism of several hepatically metabolized drugs and cause significant hyponatremia. This is problematic in patients already taking sodi-um-depleting antihypertensives. Age-related cognitive decline can worsen the situation, often leading to misdiagnosis or patient non-compliance.

tein binding, linear kinetics, a long half-life, a good safety profile, and a high therapeutic index. The goal of management should be to maintain the patient’s normal lifestyle with complete control of seizures and with minimal side effects. 
 The only randomized controlled trial in
 
new-onset geriatric epilepsy concluded that gabapentin (Neurontin) and lamotrigine (Lamictal) should be the initial therapy in such patients.
56 Trials indicate extended-re-
lease carbamazepine or levetiracetam (Kep-pra) can also be tried.
57
 The prescribing strategy includes lower ini-tial dose, slower titration, and a lower target dose than for younger patients. Intense moni-toring of dosing and drug levels is necessary to avoid toxicity. If the first drug is not tolerated well, another should be substituted. If seizures persist despite increasing dosage, a drug with a different mechanism of action should be tried.
58 
A patient with drug-resistant epilepsy (failure to respond to two adequate and appropriate antiepileptic drug trials
59) should be referred to 
an epilepsy surgical center for reevaluation and consideration of epilepsy surgery. Patient and caregiver support is an essen
-
tial component of management. New-onset 
epilepsy in the elderly has a significant ef-fect on quality of life, more so if the patient is already cognitively impaired. It erodes self-confidence, survival becomes difficult, and the condition is worse for patients who live alone. Driving restrictions further limit inde-pendence and increase isolation. Hence, psy-chological support programs can significantly boost the self-esteem and morale of such pa-tients and their caregivers.
 ■SPECIAL CONSIDERA
TION:  
EPILEPSY IN THE NURSING HOME
Certain points apply to the growing propor -
tion of elderly who reside in nursing homes:•
 Several studies in the United States and
 
in Europe60–62 suggest that this subgroup is 
at higher risk of polypharmacy and more likely to be treated with older antiepileptic drugs.
•
 Only a minority of these patients (as low
 
as 42% in one study60) received adequate 
monitoring of antiepileptic drug levels.
•
 The 
clinical characteristics and epileptic eti-
ologies of these patients are less well defined. Routine EEG  
is useful  
for screening,  
while inpatient  
video-EEG  
monitoring is  
the diagnostic  
gold standardTABLE 3

 ■OUR KNO
WLEDGE IS STILL GROWING
New-onset epilepsy, although common in the el-derly, is difficult to diagnose because of its atypi-cal presentation, concomitant cognitive impair -
ment, and nonspecific abnormalities in routine investigations. But knowledge of its common causes and differential diagnoses makes the task easier. A high suspicion warrants referral to a neurologist or epileptologist.  Challenges to the management of seizures  
in the elderly include deranged physiologic 
processes, multiple comorbidities, and poly-pharmacy. No single drug is ideal for antiepilep-tic therapy in the elderly; the choice of drug is usually dictated by seizure type, comorbidities, and tolerance level. The treatment regimen in the elderly is more conservative, and the target dosage is lower than for younger adults. Emo-tional support of patient and caregivers should 
be an important aspect of management. 
 Our knowledge about new-onset epilepsy in
 
the elderly is still growing, and future research 
should explore its diagnosis, treatment strate-
gies, and care-delivery models. 	 ■
