SUMMARY: The role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in the wound repair process has been described, particularly
during the stimulation of angiogenesis in the proliferative phase. Ulmo honey ( Eucryphia cordifolia ) has demonstrated important
bactericidal, fungicidal, antioxidant and healing properties. Ulmoplus®, a honey-based medicinal product, accelerates healing t ime
and promotes fibroblast activation and collagen fiber production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemicalexpression of endogenous FGF-2 in burns treated with Ulmoplus® vs. the gold standard (hydrogel-tull), and Ulmo honey as the
first step to clarifying the regulatory mechanism of this therapeutic option. 15 adult guinea pigs ( Cavia porcellus ) were used,
divided into three groups: C+: positive control treated with hydrogel-tull (gold standard); E1: experimental group treated with
Ulmo; and E2: experimental group treated with Ulmoplus®. A deep uniform burn was made under anesthetic that covered 1 cm
2 of
the skin on the back of each animal. The daily treatments were administered with hydrogel-tull, Ulmo honey or Ulmoplus®, whereappropriate. On treatment day 10 the biopsies were taken and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Theimmunolabeling was quantified through an integrated optical density (IOD) analysis, expressed as lum/ µm
2 using the Image-
ProPremier 9.1 software. The endogenous expression of FGF-2 was consistent with the stage of healing presented by the study
groups, varying in its localization and IOD intensity. The E2 group presented a significantly higher IOD (60053.55 ± 59877.84 lum/
µm2) than the C+ (p = 0.001) and E1 (p = 0.001) groups. Our findings indicated that the medicinal Ulmoplus® honey is effective at
facilitating wound closing, and the promoter effect of FGF-2 expression accelerated the healing process compared to the treatme nts
with hydrogel-tull (gold standard) and Ulmo honey.

INTRODUCTION
Honey has been used in folk medicine since ancient
times (Kattan et al., 2016), and its use in wound treatment is
being rediscovered (Yaghoobi & Kazerouni, 2013). Clinicalobservations indicate that the use of honey is not limited onlyits antibacterial action (Almasaudi et al., 2017), but also to its
anti-inflammatory (Devasvaran & Yong, 2016), antioxidant(Ahmed et al., 2018) and regenerative capacities, accelerating
the wound healing process (Martinotti et al., 2019).
The wound healing process involves coordinated
efforts of several cell types, including keratinocytes,fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets,
being executed and regulated by cytokines and a networkof growth factors, such as: platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF- α),
transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth fac-tor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (Mast &Schultz, 1996). This last one includes 23 different isotypes;however, after a skin injury only FGF 1, 2, 7, 10 and 22 areexpressed (Traversa & Sussman, 2001; Barrientos et al.,
2008).

involved in the healing process have been convenientlydivided into three phases that continuously and temporarilyoverlap: the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase,and the remodeling phase (Ganapathy et al., 2012; Ozgok
Kangal & Regan, 2021). FGF-2, also known as basicfibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is expressed in all thehealing phases (Desmouliere et al., 1995; Akasaka et al.,
2004; Demidova-Rice et al., 2012a) and plays a crucial
role in the healing process by promoting the proliferationof fibroblasts, inducing neovascularization, increasingcollagenase synthesis and contributing to the synthesis andremodeling of the extracellular matrix (Hayek et al., 1987;
Tsuboi & Rifkin, 1990; Gospodarowicz, 1991; Tassi et al.,
2001; Werner & Grose, 2003; Braun et al., 2004; Xie et
al., 2008; Demidova-Rice et al., 2012b).
To gain a good healing action, the selection of honey
according to its botanical origin has enabled thedevelopment of certified and authorized medical productsfor the treatment of wounds in Europe and Australia,producing Bio18+ Manuka Honey, Medihoney® and L-Mesitran®, among others (Lee et al., 2011). Ulmo honey
(Eucryphia cordifolia ) from southern Chile has
demonstrated significant bactericidal, fungicidal,antioxidant (Montenegro et al., 2013; Acevedo et al. 2017)
and healing properties (Schencke et al., 2016), reducing
the risk of infection and swelling (Sherlock et al., 2010).
Its effect on wound healing manifests significantly in thetwo first stages of healing due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, to its capacityto debride necrotic tissue, and to its promotion ofangiogenesis, granulation and epithelization (Schencke et
al., 2013). This is reigniting interest in its use in the clinical
care of venous ulcers (del Sol Calderón et al., 2015).
Supported by previous studies (Subrahmanyam,
1996; Schencke et al., 2013; del Sol Calderón et al.), a
medicinal product use based on Ulmo honey supplementedwith ascorbic acid was developed, called Ulmoplus®, theresults of which surpassed the gold standard treatment(hydrogel-tull), accelerating healing time as it promotesfibroblast activation, collagen fiber production, and theformation of basement membrane and granulation tissue(Schencke et al., 2015, 2016; Muñoz et al., 2018).
Considering the latest advances in research on the
effects of native honey in the wound healing process, theaim of the present study was to evaluate theimmunohistochemical expression of endogenous FGF-2 inburns treated with Ulmoplus® vs. the gold standard treatment
(hydrogel-tull) and Ulmo honey as the first step to explainingthe regulatory mechanism of this therapeutic 
option.MATERIAL AND METHOD
Native Honey . Samples of native Ulmo honey ( Eucryphia
cordifolia ) were collected from hives in the Valdivian Forest
of southern Chile. Then, the samples were centrifuged andstored at 4 °C in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) amber
bottles to preserve their properties. Pollen was identifiedby melissopalynological analysis (Montenegro et al., 2008)
using optical microscopy as per standard Nch2981-Of2005.The selected honey had the NHF (Native Honey Factor)seal, which certifies significant levels of antibacterialactivity (Fredes et al., 2013). Finally, it was supplemented
with acid ascorbic and sterilized by gamma irradiation at25 kGy in the Biological Tissue Processing Laboratory ofthe Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN). Thishoney for medicinal use is licensed under Ulmoplus®,being developed with the support of the Chilean ProductionDevelopment Corporation, CORFO, (13IDL2-23290), andprotected by trade secret (RS N °3654).
Animals. For the in vivo study, 15 healthy adult guinea
pigs (Cavia porcellus ) of both sexes were used, with an
average weight of 450 g, taken from the Center ofExcellence in Morphological and Surgical Studies(CEMyQ) at the Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco,Chile. Guinea pigs were used due to their ascorbic acid-dependent metabolism (Krámer et al., 1979), and because
they are a good model for experimental studies on woundhealing since their skin maintains a constant thickness(Kaufman et al., 1990; Andrades et al., 2004). The animals
were divided randomly into three groups (n=5): (C+)positive control treated with active advanced hydrogel-tulldressings (gold standard); (E1) experimental group treatedwith selected Ulmo honey that maintained the same stan-dard as that used in the formulation; and (E2) experimen-tal group treated with the Ulmoplus® formulation. Theanimals were housed at the Animal Facility and maintainedunder a 12-h light-dark cycle (08:00 am to 08:00 pm), witha pellet-based diet supplemented with ascorbic acid andwater ad libitum , and a constant room temperature (23 ± 1
°C). This experimental protocol was approved by the
Scientific Ethics Committee of the Universidad de La Fron-tera, Temuco, Chile (DI13-0044).
Experimental model . For the study of wound healing in
an animal model, a burn injury was produced according tothe protocol described by (Schencke et al., 2016). The work
was done under intraperitoneal anesthesia, applying amixture of ketamine (40 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) andatropine (0.05 mg/kg). The animals were treated daily withtherapies that consisted of a cleaning with lukewarmphysiological serum via a syringe 10 cm from the woundSCHENCKE, C.; VÁSQUEZ, B.; SANDOVAL, C. & DEL SOL, M.  Ulmoplus® increases FGF-2 expression and promote burn wound healing. Int. J. Morphol. 39(6) :1701-1708, 2021.1703and the application of a gauze impregnated with hydrogel-
tull (C+), honey (E1) or Ulmoplus® (E2), where appropriate.
Daily evaluations were done until the extraction of thebiopsies on treatment day 10. This day was selected becauseit represents a proliferative stage of wound healing, idealfor the analysis of the growth factor being studied (Robsonet al., 1998; Cañedo-Dorantes & Cañedo-Ayala, 2019).
Biopsy and histological processing . Punch biopsies of 1
cm
2 were obtained, until the deep dermis was reached. The
samples were washed with NaCl 0.9 %, fixed in bufferedformalin (1.27 mol/L of formaldehyde in phosphate buffer0.1 M; pH 7.2) at 10 % for 48 hours, dehydrated andembedded in Paraplast-Plus (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis,MO, USA). Serial sections 5 µm thick were made (Leica®
RM2255) which were mounted on slides with adherent. Forthe histological analysis, the sections were stained with VanGieson’s collagen staining. The slides were viewed underan optical microscope (Leica® DM 750) and photographedwith a digital camera (Leica® ICC50 HD).
Immunohistochemistry . For each histological section,
antigenic recovery was performed with HistoReveal(ab103720, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 20 minutes at roomtemperature, and then they were treated with 3% H
2O2 (v/v)
(107209, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS for 30minutes to block the activity of endogenous peroxidase. Eachwashing was done with PBS. First, the sections wereincubated with anti-FGF-2 IgG sheep primary antibody(ab64207, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), dilution 1:200 in PBSfor  90 minutes at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the sections
were incubated with anti-sheep IgG rabbit secondaryantibody (ab6746, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), dilution 1:500in PBS. Then, the sections were incubated with streptavidin
peroxidase (ab64269, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for an hourat room temperature. Finally, diaminobenzidine-peroxidase(ab94665, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for thevisualization, and nuclear counterstain was done with Harrishematoxylin. The slides were observed under a lightmicroscope (Leica® LED750) and photographed (Leica®ICC50W). For each immunohistochemical reaction, negativecontrols were used, which were incubated in PBS, omittingthe primary antibody (Cell MarqueTM, Rocklin, CA, USA).The immunolabeling was quantified through an integratedoptical density (IOD) analysis, expressed as lum/ µm
2, using
the Image-ProPremier 9.1 software (Media Cybernetics,Warrendale, PA, USA).
Statistical analysis . The quantitative differences in
immunolabeling were evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (analysis of normality of the data) and Levene’stest (homoscedasticity of the variances). The differencesbetween the groups were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA,followed by Tukey’s post hoc HSD test or Dunnett’s T3 test,as appropriate. The value p < 0.05 (*) was consideredstatistically significant, whereas p < 0.025 (**) wasconsidered very significant (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version21, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

In the C+ group the epidermis presented slight intensity,
with positive immunolabeling only at the level of the stratumbasale (Fig- 2B). Labeling of the cumulus of lymphocyte cells(Fig. 2C) and at endothelial level (Fig. 2D) was observed.Immunoreactivity of FGF-2 was not detected in theextracellular spaces. The E1 group showed greaterimmunostaining intensity, presenting several layers ofkeratinocytes with positive immunolabeling at the stratumbasale and part of the stratum spinosum (Fig. 3B). The labelingdistribution at endothelial level was very intense (Fig. 3C). Inaddition, a strong stain was noted at fibroblast level of thehealing dermis (Fig. 3D). The E2 group presentedimmunolabeling in several layers of keratinocytes, particularlyin the stratum corneum (Fig. 4B). The immunolabeling of FGF-2 at endothelial level was intense,
with noticeable blood vessels andstaining in capillary bulbs at theedge of the wound (Figs. 4C, 4D).Immunoreactivity of FGF-2 wasnot detected in the extracellularspaces.
The expression of FGF-2
was analyzed through IOD toassess the effect of the treatmentwith active advanced dressings ofhydrogel-tull (C+), native Ulmohoney (E1) and Ulmoplus® (E2)in burn wounds. The resultsdemonstrated that at least onegroup differs from another (p <0.001) (Fig. 5). The E2 grouppresented an IOD significantlygreater than the C+ (p = 0.001) andE1 (p = 0.001) groups.

This study used histological and immunochemical
analyses to assess the healing capacity and distributionpattern of endogenous FGF-2 in skin tissue of burns treatedwith active advanced dressings of hydrogel-tull, native Ulmohoney and Ulmoplus®.
Endogenous FGF-2 was expressed positively in the
wound tissues from all the study groups, which demonstratesthe significant performance of this factor in healing(Takamiya et al., 2002). An immunohistochemical
localization pattern of endogenous FGF-2 was observed inkeratinocytes of regenerated epidermis, endothelium ofdermal capillaries, fibroblasts and infiltrated cells of thegranulation tissue. The expression and distribution ofendogenous FGF-2 in burn wound healing observed in thisstudy is consistent with reports from other investigators. Odaet al. (2004) and Tepper et al. (2004) provided evidence of
FGF-2 expression at endothelial level, where they suggestedthe effect on acceleration of angiogenesis could be relatedto the mitogenic, angiogenic and chemiotactic capacity thatFGF-2 has for vascular endothelial cells, where thepredominant mechanism for healing and angiogenesisdepends on the significant increase of this factor. For theirSCHENCKE, C.; VÁSQUEZ, B.; SANDOVAL, C. & DEL SOL, M.  Ulmoplus® increases FGF-2 expression and promote burn wound healing. Int. J. Morphol. 39(6) :1701-1708, 2021.1706part, Kurita et al. (1992) described endogenous FGF-2 in
re-epithelialized epidermis, indicating that it might be duethe keratinocytes, being mitogenic, being essential incovering the defect with the wound; hence, FGF-2 expressionmanifests its function as leader cells in covering the wound.
Previous studies describe endogenous FGF-2
expressed in skin cells and keratinocytes as acting in anautocrine and paracrine manner by regulating cellproliferation and re-epithelization in wound healing at dermiclevel (Akimoto et al., 2002). FGF-2, a member of the FGF
family, is essential for the morphogenesis of suprabasalkeratinocytes. Indeed, the findings of Kurita et al., showed
that germinative keratinocytes express FGF-2 with anoticeable increase in post-burn samples, with constantimmunoreactive patterns and intensities throughout thewound repair period.
Our results were correlated positively with previous
studies (Schencke et al., 2016), where treatment with Ulmo
honey supplemented with ascorbic acid presented a greaterdermal proliferation area, global healing index and globalcontraction index in burns, validating the synergy of itscompounds. The healing process of the wounds observed inthe histological analysis was parallel to the expression ofthis factor in all the study groups. Nevertheless, thesignificantly greater expression of FGF-2 in the E2 experi-mental group could be related to the acceleration of healing,since histologically it was found in a more advanced stage.In this study, all the groups presented a proliferative healingstage on treatment day 10. However, during this stagehistological differences were observed, where the C+ andE1 groups were in an initial proliferative stage with someinflammatory signs, whereas the E2 group (Ulmoplus®)presented an advanced proliferative stage, with no signs ofinflammation, achieving a better effect in the dermal collagenand fibroblast activation, which could be reflected in thequality of the final scar. These results agree with previousstudies, with the same wound model, where a larger numberof active fibroblasts and greater collagen fiber concentrationwere observed in the groups treated with Ulmo honeysupplemented with ascorbic acid (Schencke et al., 2018).
The growth factors are very promising molecules for
the treatment of skin wounds. In vitro studies havedemonstrated the effects of FGF-2 on the morphology,proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in woundhealing. The results of Gibran et al. (1994) indicated that in
the extracellular matrix (ECM) and in the cytoplasm of nor-mal, undamaged cells, FGF-2 did not present animmunoreaction, suggesting that its release occurs only inthe event of damage, with a significant synthesis during thewound healing period. Their data involve the role of FGF-2as a pre-synthesizer and local cell mediator in the damaged
area, suggesting that inducing a gradual increase in FGF-2release or the exogenous application of FGF-2 could bebeneficial to improving the tissue wound healing time. Inaddition, it has been described that the exogenous applicationof this factor acts as a potent inducer of angiogenesis andformation of granulation tissue, stimulating wound healingin animal models (Liu et al., 2007). However, their clinical
use has been seriously limited by problems related to safetyand performance. These problems can arise from the factthat the growth factors are used in supraphysiological levelswithout optimized management systems (Rizzi et al., 2010).
Therefore, it is likely that when stimulating the endogenousrelease of this fact
or at suitable levels, the healing process
of a full thickness burn is accelerated. The expression ofendogenous FGF-2 in experimental group E2 (60053.55 ±
59877.84 lum/ µm
2) was greater than that in E1 (38100.09
± 29112.43 lum/ µm2; p=0.001) and C+ (36034.73 ±
36984.52 lum/ µm2; p=0.001), which suggests that
Ulmoplus® can induce FGF-2 secretion and promote itsexpression, participating in wound healing as a positiveregulatory factor.
Honey can trigger the sequence of events necessary toimprove angiogenesis and the proliferation of fibroblasts(Molan, 2006) and epithelial cells (Tonks et al., 2003) when
the production of certain growth factors is induced. Studieshave shown how honey improves the bioactivity of platelet-rich plasma in skin regeneration, accelerating wound closingand healing (Sell et al., 2012). The identification of these
individual compounds and their contributions to thetreatment of wounds is crucial to a better understanding ofthe mechanisms behind the healing mediated by honey innormal or chronic wounds, especially at ECM level. In orderto obtain a good coordination of the signaling of the growthfactor in question, the ECM has a fundamental role (Briquezet al., 2015); therefore, understanding the mechanisms by
which the ECM modulates the activity of this growth factoris key to designing efficient therapies.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that the topical treatment
with Ulmoplus® was more efficient than the gold standardtreatment (hydrogel-tull), since it accelerated the healing ofa burn, positively regulating angiogenesis and re-epithelization mediated by FGF-2.
Finally, it is important to indicate that there are no
studies that demonstrate the action at cellular level of nativeUlmo honey from southern Chile and Ulmoplus® in theSCHENCKE, C.; VÁSQUEZ, B.; SANDOVAL, C. & DEL SOL, M.
