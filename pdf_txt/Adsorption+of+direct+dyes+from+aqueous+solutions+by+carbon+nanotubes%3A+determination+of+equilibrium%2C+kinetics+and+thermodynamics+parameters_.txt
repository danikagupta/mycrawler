Keywords:
Initial adsorption ratePseudo-second-order kinetic model
Intraparticle diffusion model
Quotation errorTwo most suggested papers for pseudo-second-order kinetic model were published in 1984 and 1995 by
Blanchard et al. and Ho, respectively. Blanchard et al. noted the overall exchange reaction of NH+
4ions
ﬁxed in zeolite by divalent metallic ions in the solution using a second-order kinetic model. Ho used the
pseudo-second-order kinetic model to the copper ion/peat adsorption system. The adsorption involved
chemical bonding and cation exchange. In this comment citation error and quotation error were pointed.

Recently, Kuo et al. [1]published the paper noted above. In
Section 3.2.1 , Effects of dye concentration, the authors noted a
pseudo-second-order model, initial adsorption rate h, and intra-
particle diffusion model. In the case of the pseudo-second-order
model the authors cited two secondary materials as references[2,3] . In fact, the pseudo-second-order kinetic expression for the
adsorption systems of divalent metal ions using sphagnum mosspeat has been presented by Ho [4]and this kinetic expression has
also been published in 1996 [5]. At the same time Ho has pre-
sented a deﬁnition for the initial adsorption rate from the pseudo-
second-order model. A modiﬁed model has been made in thefollowing years because a mistake was included in the paper pub-lished in 1996 [6–8] . However, in the case of initial adsorption rate,
the authors noted that “the initial adsorption rate h(mg/g min) can
be determined by using the equation h
=k2q2
e” without any cita-
tions. In the case of the intraparticle diffusion model, the authors
cited the same two secondary materials as references [2,3] .Aq u o -
tation error of the intraparticle diffusion model was contained in

found in the original paper of Weber and Morris [9].
Accuracy of quotations and citations is very important for the
transmission of scientiﬁc knowledge. I suggest that Kuo et al. cite
the original or the most frequently cited papers for the kineticmodels to have more accuracy and details of information about
kinetic expression.
