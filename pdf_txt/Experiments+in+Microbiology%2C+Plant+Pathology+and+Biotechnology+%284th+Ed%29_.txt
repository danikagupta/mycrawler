Rationale for nature of the course  
Practical skills on various microbiological techniques form the basis of biotechnological experiments. 
Isolation, screening, i dentification and characterization of various types of microorganisms and its 
significance in clinical, environmental, industrial processes paved the way for novel biotechnological 
inventions. Understanding the nature, growth requirements and characteristi cs of microorganisms helps 
to explore its economic importance in the field of biotechnology.  
 
Activities having direct bearing on skill development/ employability/entrepreneurship  
 Providing practical insight on quality of milk and water.  
 Characterization o f microbes present in environmental samples and exploring its ecological 
consequences.
