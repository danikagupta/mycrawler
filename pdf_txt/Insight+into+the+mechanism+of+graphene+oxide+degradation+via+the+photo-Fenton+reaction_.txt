The influence of functional groups on the degradation of graphene oxide nanomaterials under direct sun-
light was investigated by systematically varying the surface chemistry. Using a solvothermal reduction pro-cess, graphene nanomaterials with varying oxidation levels, including graphene oxide, partially reduced
graphene oxide and fully reduced graphene oxide, were prepared. The physical and chemical properties of
the nanomaterials were extensively characterized before and after exposure to simulated sunlight. Thedegradation of the nanomaterials was determined to be directly related to the functional groups present
on the basal plane of the graphene nanomaterials. Specifically, the hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups
are the most susceptible to photodegradation. Upon sunlight exposure, the amount of oxygen-containingfunctional groups on all graphene nanomaterials decreases over time, with fully reduced graphene oxide
showing the lowest degradation rate due to the presence of fewer reactive functional groups on the sur-
face. Overall, these results suggest that the oxygen-containing functional groups on the basal plane are themajor initiators of the photodegradation of graphene nanomaterials.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are being explored for a
myriad of applications in the electronic, biomedical, pharma-ceutical, cosmetic, energy, and paint industries.
1–5In particu-
lar, graphene and other carbon-based nanomaterials are used
in many environmental applications including coating and ca-talysis and as sorbents for water and wastewater treatment.
2,62D graphene sheets, whose honeycomb lattice is composed ofsp
2-hybridized carbon atoms, demonstrate unique physical
and chemical characteristics.7The hexagonal ring structure of
graphene resembles polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
and can be considered as a large sheet of many fused PAHs.8
Traditional forms of graphene, currently used in different ap-
plications, include pristine graphene, graphene oxide (GO),
and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). While pristine grapheneis often the most desirable for applications, GO and rGO are
more commonly used due to their scalable and cost-effective
methods of production. GO is an oxidized form of graphenewith additional functional groups such as epoxy, hydroxyl,
carbonyl, and carboxyl groups covalently bound on the basal
planes (for epoxy and hydroxyl groups) or the edges (for car-bonyl and carboxyl groups).
9These functional groups make
GO hydrophilic and therefore readily dispersible in water.10

Graphene nanomaterials are one of the most commonly used carbon-based nanomaterials in industries. However, degradation of graphene nanomaterial s
has become an environmental issue. While graphene oxide has been shown to be susceptible to degradation under sunlight, it is still unknown how the
various functional groups in graphene oxide nanomaterials can play roles in degradation. In this study, the influence of functional groups on the deg rada-
tion of graphene nanomaterials under direct sunlight was investigated. The degradation of the nanomaterials was determined to be directly related t o the
functional groups present on the basal plane of the graphene nanomaterials. Specifically, the hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups are the most susc epti-
ble to photodegradation. Upon sunlight exposure, the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on all graphene nanomaterials decreases over t ime,
with fully reduced graphene oxide showing the lowest degradation rate due to the presence of fewer reactive functional groups on the surface. Overall , these
results suggest that the oxygen-containing functional groups on the basal plane are the major initiators of the photodegradation of graphene nano-
materials. This work provides important insight into the role of functional groups in the stability and degradation of graphene nanomaterials, and t hus
contributes to the design of sustainable applications of these nanomaterials.

View JournalEnviron. Sci.: Nano This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019The degradation and transformation of graphene nano-
materials need to be well-understood in order to establishtheir potential environmental risks. For example, graphene
can transform and degrade into numerous combinations of
PAHs,
11,12which are potentially carcinogenic and pose a
number of environmental and health risks.8,13Fenton reac-
tions may cause oxidation of graphene materials,14while
microbial interactions can cause reduction.15Hence, multiple
types of interactions can occur with suspended graphene ma-
terials in the environment.16Photodegradation is one among
several pathways that can cause transformation of graphenenanomaterials in the environment. Thus, in order to under-
stand the long-term environmental impact of graphene nano-
materials, it is important to study sunlight-mediated photoly-sis and degradation.
Recent studies have shown that GO can be highly stable
against aggregation in a natural aquatic environment,
17,18in-
dicating that GO will persist in water where sunlight-
mediated photo-transformation can occur.17,18Additionally,
this transformation can have an impact on the fate and trans-port of these materials. Transformation by sunlight photoly-
sis is one of the primary routes by which carbonaceous mate-
rials such as fullerenes transform into CO
2and other oxygen
containing functionalities.19–27Some recent studies have
shown that graphene is photoreactive.12,28 –30For example,
one study found that GO readily reacts under simulated sun-light exposure, forming fragmented photoproducts that are
similar to reduced GO (rGO) as well as low molecular weight
(LMW) species.
31Furthermore, GO photoreactivity involves
the simultaneous formation of oxidative and reductive tran-
sient species.
To date, studies have investigated only the photo-
degradation of GO. The influence of functional groups on the
degradation process of graphene nanomaterials is still un-
known. These knowledge gaps have motivated this study todetermine the influence of functional groups on the direct
photolysis of graphene nanomaterials. We hypothesize that
the degradation of graphene flakes starts at the basal planes,caused by the presence of the epoxy and hydroxyl functional
groups. Thus, we anticipate that the presence, identity, and
quantity of these functional groups will influence the degra-dation process of the materials.
32,33Furthermore, we hypoth-
esize that rGO will be more resistant to degradation due to
the presence of fewer functional groups and increased hydro-phobicity.
16The fate and transformation of nanomaterials
are key factors to consider when determining their environ-
mental risk.34This work provides important insight into the
role of functional groups in the stability and degradation of
graphene nanomaterials, and thus contributes to the design
of sustainable applications of these materials.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Graphene oxide materials were synthesized using a modified
Hummers' method.35To vary the functional groups on thesurface, two samples of reduced GO —partially reduced
graphene oxide (rGO-2 h) and fully reduced graphene oxide(rGO-5 h) —were prepared by a solvothermal reduction pro-
cess. In particular, GO was suspended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolid-
one (NMP) and heated to 150 °C with constant stirring in a
silicone oil bath. The heat reflux was stopped after 2 hours
and 5 hours to achieve varying levels of reduction. After the
solvothermal reduction, the rGO was separated from theNMP using vacuum filtration with 0.1 μm alumina filters
(Millipore), rinsed heavily with DI water, and re-dispersed in
DI water at an approximate concentration of 1 mg mL
−1.36All
aqueous solutions for irradiation were prepared using Milli-Q
(deionized water ≥18 M Ω) water. Each stock solution was di-
luted to a concentration of 50 mg L−1of nanomaterials (GO,
rGO-2 h, and rGO-5 h) in Milli-Q water.
2.2 Photodegradation studies
All simulated sunlight experiments were carried out using an
Atlas SunTest CPS+ solar simulator, equipped with a 1 kW xe-non arc lamp. The sunlight experiments were carried out in
borosilicate glass tubes (outer diameter = 1.3 cm; volume =
24 mL; conforms to ASTM Type 1, Class A and USP Type 1Glass) that were filled to 10 ml with the working solutions.
The sample tubes were sealed with open-top caps lined with
gastight polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and kept on top of amesh to keep them submerged in a thermostatic water bath
(25°C) during irradiation. The incident light intensity at the
tube surface (300 nm to 800 nm) was 0.065 W cm
−2. For ki-
netic studies, a series of tubes were prepared for irradiation.
Photodegradation tests were continued for 168 h. At specific
time points during irradiation, individual tubes were re-moved from the reactor for chemical analysis. After removal,
the tubes were wrapped with aluminum foil and kept in a re-
frigerator. Dark control tubes were wrapped with aluminumfoil and kept under the same experimental conditions. De-
tails of the control study are described in the ESI. †
2.3 Material characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to monitor the size
and morphology of the graphene oxide flakes. The physical
dimensions of the GO, including flake thickness and lateral
size, were quantified from AFM image analysis, as describedpreviously.
31,36For AFM imaging, silicon wafers were cleaned
and dried and then functionalized with a monolayer of
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) by soaking the wafersin a 2.5 mM solution of APTES in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for
30 minutes. Following the APTES treatment, the wafers were
rinsed with IPA and dried with a nitrogen gun. The GO solu-tions were bath sonicated for 5 minutes before being drop-
cast onto the APTES functionalized wafers. The GO was
allowed to sit for 10 minutes on the wafer before being rinsedwith water and dried with a nitrogen gun. The samples were
then annealed at 250 °C for 30 minutes on a hotplate before
imaging with a Cypher Asylum ES AFM.Environmental Science: Nano Paper

View Article OnlineEnviron. Sci.: Nano This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019Ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy spectra were collected
using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 365 UV-visible absorptionspectrophotometer equipped with a 1 cm light path quartz
cuvette. Changes in the UV-vis spectra were used to monitor
the graphene oxide concentration and changes in light ab-sorption properties.
The zeta potential, hydrodynamic diameter, and polydis-
persity index of the particles were measured using a ZetasizerNano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Inc.). A 1 cm light path
quartz cuvette was used for size measurements and a folded
capillary cell DTS1070 was used for zeta potential measure-ments. The hydrodynamic diameter of the particle or the par-
ticle size is determined viathe diffusion coefficient typically
as sphere equivalent.
37Also, calculation of zeta potential
values from EPM measurements uses the Smoluchowski
equation which assumes spherical particles. Hence, it is
recommended to use this approach for spherical particles.38
Solutions were bath sonicated for 5 minutes preceding
measurement.
XPS was utilized to determine the chemical composition
of the graphene nanomaterials. For XPS, approximately 5 mg
of GO or rGO in DI water were deposited onto 1 μm PTFE
membranes (Millipore) using vacuum filtration. The film wasallowed to settle for 15 minutes, rinsed with 30 mL DI water,
and then dried in air. XPS measurements were performed
promptly using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi. XPSspectra were corrected for background and fitted for peaks
manually.

Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a
Shimadzu TOC-Vcsh total organic carbon analyzer with the
NDIR method (combustion at 720 °C due to the attached to-
tal nitrogen measurement unit). The TOC analyzer is capableof detecting the total organic carbon concentration in the
sample. Sample solutions were diluted and transferred to 40
mL vials. The volume of injected solution was 80 μL, with
three injections for each sample. After analyzing 10 samples,
washing was performed.
2.4 Statistical analysis
Statistical testing was employed for data analysis. Two-
sample t-tests for hypothesis testing were conducted using
OriginPro 2016 software (OriginLab Corporation, MA) to
guarantee the statistical significance of the conclusions.Probability values ( P) of less than 0.05 were considered as sta-
tistically significant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical properties of GO and rGO
Table 1 shows the lateral size distributions based on the AFM
images of the GO and rGO samples before and after irradia-
tion. Before irradiation, the lateral sizes of all GO and rGO
nanomaterials are similar, indicating that the reduction pro-cess does not change the physical dimensions of the GO or
rGO flakes ( P>0.05). Hydrodynamic diameter measurements
confirmed that there was no significant difference ( P>0.05)in particle size between the initial GO, rGO-2 h, and rGO-5 h
dispersions (Table S1 †). However, sizes of rGO-2 h and rGO-5
h are statistically different ( P<0.05), with rGO-5 h having a
higher size. Zeta potential measurements, across all initial
dispersions, indicate stable dispersions due to electrostaticrepulsion among particles (Table S2 †).
The initial XPS spectra of GO, rGO-2 h, and rGO-5 h are
shown in Fig. 3. The spectra exhibit three major peaks corre-sponding to C –C at 284.8 eV, epoxy and hydroxyl functional
groups (C –O) at 286.9 eV, and carbonyl groups (C O) at 289
eV.
39–41These peaks were quantified and are listed in
Table 2. During the solvothermal process, the epoxy and hy-
droxyl groups on the basal plane of the GO are driven off,
evidenced by the decrease in the C –O peak and the overall de-
crease of oxygen in rGO-2 h and rGO-5 h ( P<0.05). Further-
more, the emergence of the peak at 292 eV, due to the π→
π*transition, is indicative of the restoration of the graphene
lattice.
These composition data are further supported by the opti-
cal absorption spectra of the GO nanomaterials. The initialGO dispersion shows absorption peaks at 230 nm, related to
theπ–π*transitions of the aromatic C –C bonds, and a shoul-
der at 300 nm, corresponding to the n–π*transitions due to
the presence of oxygen containing functional groups, such as
epoxide (C –O–C) (Fig. 4a).
42–47Conversely, the initial rGO-2 h
and rGO-5 h dispersions show a single absorption peak at270 nm, indicating the restoration of the π-conjugated net-
work of graphene. Furthermore, the disappearance of the
shoulder at 300 nm suggests the loss of oxygen-containinggroups (Fig. 4b and c).
48–52
Overall, the three GO dispersions were prepared wherein
the surface oxidation was systematically varied while othermaterial properties were kept constant to determine the role
of oxygen-containing functional groups in the direct photoly-
sis of graphene family nanomaterials.
3.2 Photodegradation of GO and rGO
3.2.1 AFM analysis. The three GO nanomaterial disper-
sions were exposed to simulated sunlight, and the size of the
particles was monitored using AFM. In Fig. 1, the AFM im-ages of both rGO-2 h and rGO-5 h show no considerable
change in the size of the particles after 24 h of irradiation.

0.05) in the size of rGO-2 h and rGO-5 h after 24 h of irradia-tion. On the other hand, the lateral size of GO particles was
reduced from 180 ± 160 nm to 100 ± 50 nm (a reduction of
∼44%) within the first 24 h of irradiation (Table 1). This re-
duction of size is immediately apparent in the AFM images(Fig. 1). This rapid decrease in the lateral size of the GO indi-
cates that the material breaks down quickly upon irradiationwhile rGO degrades at a significantly slower rate.
3.2.2 TOC analysis. Degradation of rGO and GO particles
was further investigated by TOC measurements. Previously, re-duction of organic carbon throug h oxidative photochemical deg-
radation has been observed with other nanomaterials and pol-
lutants in the presence of UV light and sunlight.
6,53–55The GO
sample showed a TOC reduction of 32.1% after 3 days of irradia-
tion (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the majority of this TOC re-
duction occurred in the first 6 hours (27.65%) but then slowedconsiderably over the next 162 hours, indicating that GO un-
dergoes rapid photodegradation upon the initial 6 hours of ex-
posure to sunlight. The TOC reduction for rGO-2 h and rGO-5 hafter 3 days of irradiation was 28.8% and 14.5%, respectively,

These results further confirm the delayed degradation of the
rGO samples. A previous study of GO transformation by directphotolysis under simulated sunlight,
31with similar experimen-
tal conditions, showed from mass spectrometry analysis that di-
rect photolysis will rapidly remove GO by photochemically

After 24 h of sunlight exposure, GO degrades into smaller flakes while rGO shows no significant change in particle size.

and LMW species (mainly hydroxylated and/or carboxylated PAH
compounds). The formation of oxygenated PAH species was con-sistent with previous work in which GO transformation was
driven by a photo-Fenton reaction.

3.2.3 Electrokinetic and hydrodynamic properties of
phototransformed GO and rGO. A Zetasizer Nano ZS was
used to analyze the change in particle size. From the hydro-
dynamic diameter values, a rapid decrease in the size of theGO (∼36%) is observed compared to rGO-2 h ( ∼25%) and
rGO-5 h ( ∼12%) after 24 h (Table S1; †P<0.05). Even after
48 h, the size of GO decreases further ( ∼45%) from the initial
size. However, under exposure to prolonged light (168 h), the
size of the GO material decreased compared to its initial size,
but this reduction is not that significant unlike the size re-duction in the initial exposure time. The major size reductionoccurred during the initial hours of exposure to sunlight.
31
This decrease in size for GO was verified by the TOC analysis
as shown in Fig. S3. †On the other hand, extended light expo-
sure promotes rGO aggregation, which leads to the increase
in size measurements. This size reduction is attributed to the
degradation of graphene oxide flakes during irradiation,which is supported by the AFM analysis (Fig. 1), implying
that the rGO samples degrade at a significantly slower rate.
Zeta potential (ZP) is an important indicator of the stabil-
ity of particles. The ZP values of both GO and rGO samples
were in the range of −30 to −50 mV (Table S2 †). From the
negative value of the ZP, it can be concluded that the parti-cles have a negatively charged surface. Furthermore, the mag-
nitude of the ZP indicates that all GO samples are stably dis-
persed.
56,57However, despite having a negative ZP of greater
magnitude than 30 mV, the rGO samples were found to be

GO undergoes a noticeable chemical reduction where the amount of hydroxyl (C –OH) and epoxy (C –O–C) groups decreases significantly upon ir-
radiation for 72 hours, while no significant compositional changes in the rGO materials are observed.

after photodegradation resembles that of rGO. These hydroxyland epoxy functional groups are located primarily on the basal
plane of the graphene oxide, and it is hypothesized that these
functional groups will react first in the presence of sunlight asthey are single bonded groups. Functional groups on the edges,
such as carboxylic acid, are much more stable and less likely to
react initially. From the XPS spectra, the ratio of C Oi n -
creases indicating that COOH functional groups are more sta-
ble and the relative fraction of COOH functional groups in-
creases with photodegradation. Changes in the oxygen-containing functional groups as a result of the photo-
degradation were also verified by UV-vis optical absorption
spectroscopy. The presence of oxygen-containing functionalgroups on the surface disrupts the conjugated system of
graphene, causing a shift in the absorption peaks.
51,52The
samples were irradiated, and the absorbance at 400 nm wasmonitored over time (Fig. S4 †). In the case of GO, the absor-
bance increased over time, indicating a photochemical change
likely caused by the formation of light-absorbing photoprod-ucts.
31Sunlight exposure also resulted in a shift in the peak po-
sition from 230 nm to 270 nm, indicating the restoration of the
π-conjugation network of graphene (Fig. 4a). The disappear-
ance of the shoulder at 300 nm suggests the removal of oxygen
groups (such as hydroxyl and epoxy groups) consistent with the
XPS results.48–50Conversely, no significant changes in the UV-
vis spectra are observed in the rGO materials (Fig. 4b and c).
Fig. 5a shows that as the photodegradation progressed,
the color of the GO samples darkened due to sunlight expo-sure, again indicative of degradation of GO. Previously,
60,61
this color change has been observed and attributed to thepartial restoration of the conjugated carbon ring network dueto the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups. This
same phenomenon has been observed during the chemical
reduction of GO sheets, as discussed earlier.
62,63Removal of
these functional groups due to sunlight exposure would also
result in the particles becoming more hydrophobic
(Fig. 5b and c). This increased hydrophobicity could induceaggregation in the rGO samples and delay the degradation of
rGO-2 h and rGO-5 h. Moreover, beyond a certain irradiation
time, rGO particles begin to form larger aggregates that cansettle, reducing the opportunity for photodegradation of the
material. The aggregation and settling characteristics of
graphene nanomaterials observed in this study are consistentwith previous studies with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) where it
was observed that UVC irradiation destabilized a colloidal
suspension of CNTs. In these studies,
24,25it was observed
that removal of oxygen-containing functional groups de-
creased the electrostatic repulsion between particles and
caused aggregation. However, no significant structural trans-formation was observed for the samples.
24,25
3.3 Kinetic analysis
For GO and rGO nanomaterials, the photolysis kinetics can
be expressed by the following equation,dA
dAobs,Atk
where kobs,A is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of di-
rect photolysis of compound A (A = GO or rGO-2 h or rGO-5h). The degradation kinetics of GO occurs in two (fast and
slow) stages. For GO nanomaterials, the loss or degradation
of the material, which is measured as the decrease in TOCconcentration (Fig. S5 †), occurs in two (fast and slow) stages.
The fastest degradation occurs during the initial exposure to
sunlight (first 24 h) in which k
obs,GO was determined to be
0.017 h−1(R2= 0.91). After 24 h of sunlight exposure, the loss
of the nanomaterial was slower, and kobs,GO was determined
to be 0.007 h−1(R2= 0.80) after 72 h of sunlight exposure. So,
two-stage kinetics has been observed in the photodegradation
of GO (Fig. S5 †). Initially, the rate was high, and pseudo-first
order kinetics were observed; then, in the second phase, thedegradation became slower.
64
The kobs,rGO-2h slightly decreased to 0.005 h−1(R2= 0.83),
in comparison to kobs,GO , while kobs,rGO-5h significantly de-
creased to 0.002 h−1(R2= 0.51), in comparison to kobs,rGO-2h
(Fig. S5 †). As the pseudo-first-order rate constants for rGO-2
h and rGO-5 h are less than that of GO, it indicates that theTOC decrease is higher for GO, compared to rGO materials.
Hence, the order of the degradation rate follows GO >rGO-2
h>rGO-5 h.
3.4 Proposed mechanisms
Fig. 6 shows the proposed mechanisms for the photo-
degradation of GO and rGO under direct sunlight. In directphotolysis, the functional groups of graphene nanomaterials
act as chromophores.
31,65 –67Hydroxyl and epoxy functional
groups, located mainly on the basal plane of GO, are hypothe-sized to react first in the presence of sunlight as they are single
bonded groups. Other functional groups on the edges are dou-
ble bonded groups, which require more energy to break themthan single bonds, and are thus less likely to react initially.
68,69
The hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups (C –OH and C –O),
which are strong electron donating groups, absorb photonsthat excite electrons from the ground state to the excited state,
producing many excited electrons and holes.
70Eventually,
these electrons and holes disrupt the chemical bonds of thefunctional groups, initiating the breaking of the covalent bonds
and contributing to the physical breakdown of the GO
material.

GO consists of insulating or semi-conducting sp3-hybrid-
ized carbon domains on the basal plane and non-oxidized
sp2segments that are either aromatic or conjugated.75Dur-
ing the photoreduction, the bandgap excitation of the semi-
conducting region is responsible for the reduction process.76
A typical semiconductor has an energy gap between the va-
lence and conduction bands. On exposure to visible light, GO
absorbs photons with energy equal to or larger than its
bandgap to excite an electron from the valence band to theEnvironmental Science: Nano Paper

conduction band and an empty energy state in the valenceband –the hole.

the redox reactions on the GO sheet.
C–O has a bond energy of 358 kJ mol−1or 5.945 ×10−19J
per photon (note: the Avogadro constant has the value of
6.022 ×1023mol−1).
The energy associated with radiation is given by

where
Eis the energy in Joules,
his Planck's constant ( h= 6.626 ×10−34J s),
cis the speed of light ( c= 3.0 ×108ms−1) and
λis the wavelength of light in units of nm.
To break the oxygen containing bond (C –O and C –OH),
the required wavelength calculated from the above equationis 335 nm, which is well within the range of our applied irra-
diation (300 nm to 800 nm). This quantitatively proves the
breakup of the oxygen containing functional groups from thebasal plane of the GO material.
Other functional groups, remaining on the edge, will not
react initially as they are double bonded groups, which re-quires more energy to break them (C O: 745 kJ mol
−1or
1.237 ×10−18J per photon, requiring 160 nm
wavelength).68,69,79
rGO has significantly fewer oxygen-containing functional
groups than GO. Specifically, the amount of hydroxyl and ep-oxy functional groups is significantly lower (Table 2). This re-
duction in electron donating functional groups in rGO will
reduce the breaking of covalent bonds in rGO. Hence, rGO ismore resistant to degradation than GO under direct photoly-
sis, as we have shown in our photodegradation studies. Fur-
thermore, rGO particles aggregate due to the increased hydro-phobicity of these materials, which can reduce the
opportunity for photodegradation. Aqueous aggregation (sta-
bility) of nanomaterials significantly impacts effective toxic-ity, environmental transport, and ultimate material fate.
80
Moreover, aggregation can alter nanoparticle reactivity, andthe nanoparticle aggregation state can be altered by photo-chemical environmental processes.
81The reduced content of
functional groups increases the hydrophobicity of rGO parti-
cles. As rGO becomes more hydrophobic, it becomes more pr-one to form aggregates ( i.e.increase in size) and less prone
to degrade. So, both reactivity and stability (aggregation) play
roles in the degradation.
3.4.a. Degradation analysis with density functional theory
(DFT). We further used the DFT method to characterize the
thermodynamic energy change for the structure degradation
Fig. 6 Schematics of the proposed reaction pathway for graphene oxide nanomaterial degradation. (Top) GO is shown with oxygen-containing
(hydroxyl and epoxy) functional groups. Due to absorption of photons from sunlight, the functional groups are removed, accelerating the physicaldegradation. (Bottom) rGO with fewer functional groups undergoes reduced degradation than GO under similar irradiation.Environmental Science: Nano Paper

View Article OnlineEnviron. Sci.: Nano This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019of GO sheets. We assumed that the degradation process con-
sists of two consecutive steps: 1) removal of functionalgroups on the graphene plane and 2) C –C bond breakage.
The DFT calculations were performed using the ADF soft-
ware.
82Two types of GO models were considered: one has a
single hydroxyl group (denoted as GO1, which is rGO) and
the other one has two hydroxyl groups (denoted as GO2,
which is GO). All initial structures were optimized and single-point energy calculations were performed by the B3LYP-D3/
TZP method.
From our computation (Fig. 7a), in the first step, the re-
moval of one hydroxyl functional group is a kinetic process
with an existence of a transition state (TS). However, in the
second step, the breakage of the C –C bond is a thermody-
namically unfavorable process with energetic penalty. For
GO2, corresponding to a higher oxidation degree, the barrier
of the transition state is very small ( ∼0.6 kcal mol
−1), how-
ever, the energy barrier to remove the hydroxyl group for GO1
is∼6.0 kcal mol−1, which is obviously larger than that of
GO2. We further calculated the energy profiles for the as-sumed GO degradation process with the C –C breakage,
wherein there is breakage of three C –C bonds. As shown in
Fig. 7b, the required energy for breaking the C –C bond in the
GO1 structure is to some extent higher than that of GO2,showing that the degradation of GO with a lower oxidation
degree, which is GO1 (rGO), is more difficult. It should benoted that the energy difference is relatively minor, possibly
due to the small size of the graphene model with only 1 –2 hy-
droxyl groups. However, these different energetic profiles in-deed support the experimental conclusion that more degra-
dation of GO sheets with a higher oxidization degree can be
realized.
Overall, these results suggest that sunlight exposure
causes significant degradation of graphene oxide, but no sig-
nificant change in reduced graphene oxide nanomaterials isobserved. Oxygen-containing functional groups on the basal
plane are the most likely photoreactive sites that contribute
to the breakdown of GO nanomaterials.
83–85The presence of
fewer oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of
rGO materials leads to delayed degradation of the materials.
4. Environmental implications
Collective results from this study indicate that the surface ox-idation of graphene nanomaterials strongly affects sunlight-
induced photolysis. The oxygen-containing functional groups,primarily those present on the basal plane, play a strong role
in the photodegradation of GO. This degradation will have an
obvious impact on the fate of these emerging materials inthe environment. Based on the findings of this research, it
can be assumed that graphene oxide nanomaterials will un-
dergo degradation in natural surface water due to sunlightexposure, which potentially leads to nanoparticle release into
the environment. Since nanoparticles have shown potential
risks to human health and the environment when releasedduring their life cycle, commercialization of these nano-
materials could be restrained. In particular, graphene oxide
nanomaterials with higher levels of oxidation will experiencehigher rates of photodegradation, while reduced forms of
graphene oxide will show a higher resistance to this degrada-
tion due to fewer functional groups on the surface. These
findings will also be helpful for designing sustainable
graphene nanomaterials for various applications. For coat-ings and photocatalytic applications, graphene nanomaterials
are desired to be resistant to photodegradation. Hence,
graphene with lower amounts of oxygen containing func-tional groups will be useful for coatings and photocatalytic
applications.
