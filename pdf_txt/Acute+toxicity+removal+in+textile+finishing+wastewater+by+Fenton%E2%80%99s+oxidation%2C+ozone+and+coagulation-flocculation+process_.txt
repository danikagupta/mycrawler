ABSTRACT 
In this work, pre-ozonation fo r degradation, decolouriz ation and detoxicifyi ng of a raw textile 
wastewater collected in a textile fininshing industry, Istanbul (Turke y) is investigated. Differing 
from the previous studies, a low ozone (O 3) flow rate (9.6 mg min-1) was applied at original pH 
of the wastewater. The effect of pH varying from 5 to 11 and the H 2O2 dose of 600 mg l-1 on 
ozone oxidation were also investigated. The ac ute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater 
samples were measured using 24 h newborn Daphnia magna . COD, colour in APHA Pt-Co 
(platin-cobalt) unit and absor bance at 450, 500 and 550 nm wave lengths which were 
coinciding the peak absorbance band of the ra w wastewater were analyzed in treated 
samples.  
A 60% of acute toxicity, 92% of  and 50% of to tal COD removal were obtained at original pH 
of wastewater by applying ozone for 30 min. Absorbed ozone dose was 105 mg l-1 with a 
ozone transfer rate of 3.5 mg l-1. Varying pH did not improve toxicity removal, however, 
soluble COD removal increased at 3 and 6% respec tively for 9.0 and 11.0 values while colour 
removal increased (7%) only at 11.0 pH. Adding 600 mg l-1 of H 2O2 increased COD removal 
at 10% after 20 min oxidation. Colour re moval increase was more significant in O 3/H2O2 
oxidation in parallel with the increase in absorbance kinetics. 
All over results obtained this study are expected to contribute to control the textile industry 
wastewater pollution and to protect aquatic environment.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Textile industry originates a complex wastewat er containing various chemicals used in the 
process such as dyestuff, surfac e-active materials and textile a dditives. Many azo dyes which 
cause intensive colour in the wastewater [1-5] and textile industry effluent [6-8] have been 
found to mutagen/carcinogen/toxic to aquatic or ganisms. Many advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs) such as photocatalytic  oxidation [9], Fenton [8] and P hoto-fenton oxidat ion [10] have 
been applied individually or combined with UV, H 2O2 oxidants to decolourize, detoxicify and 
degradate  textile wastewater and dyes.  
Ozone (O 3) oxidationas has been ext ensively studied to decolour ise dyes [11] or pre- 
oxidation to enhance t he biodegradability [12-14] or to reduc e inert COD fractions [15] and 
toxicity removal [8,9,16] and post treatment  of textile industry wastewater [17].  
Both molecular ozone and especially hydroxyl radical (OH•) which is non selective oxidant 
forming decomposition of O 3 as explained by eqs (1-2), pl ay an important role for the 
oxidation of organics [18]:    SELCUK et al.  96 
O3 ↔ O + O 2                  (1) 
O + H 2O ↔ 2OH•                  (2) 
These reactions occur simultaneously. The chromophor groups in textile dyes can be 
broken by ozone (directly or indirectly) formi ng smaller molecules resulting in colourless 
effluent [11]. The wastewater characteristics (i.e. pH, concentration of initiators, 
promoters and scavengers) play important ro le on the process efficiency, hence on the 
reaction kinetics. For instance, O 3 decomposes readily to OH• radicals at high pH (11.0-
12.0), while ozone reacts with OH- and produces hydroperoxide radicals according to eq. 
3: 
O3 + OH-   →   HO 2· + O 2·   k = 70 M-1s-1                 (3) 
When ozone is used with H 2O2 (weak acid), here ozone reacts both with H 2O2 and HO 2- 
which occurs much faster than H 2O2. Thus, the reaction with H 2O2 can be neglected and 
the eq. 5 and consequent reactions to form OH• radicals (eqs. 6-7) are considered. 
H2O2  ↔  H+   + HO 2-    K a = 2.24*10-12               (4) 
HO 2-  + O 3 →   O 3- + HO 2·   k1 = (2.8 ± 0.5)106 M-1s-1  (25ºC)             (5)  
O3- +  H+ → OH + O2                    (6) 
HO 2· + O 3  → OH· + 2O 2                    (7) 
Because the reaction with OH• radicals occurs much faster than that of O 3, the reaction with 
ozone is ignored for total reaction rate [13].   
Although there exist intensive literature on O 3 oxidation of textile wa stewater notated above, 
the toxicity removal by pre-ozonation, in particular, with the addition of H 2O2 or pH varying has 
not been optimized due to wastewat er characteristics in detail.  In this study, pre-ozonation 
was attempted for detoxicifying, decolourizi ng and biodegradation of a textile finishing 
industry wastewater (Istanbul, Turk ey). The effect of pH and H 2O2 on ozone oxidation to 
remove toxicity was also investigated. D. magna  as a standard and reliable toxicity testing 
method was used to optimize O 3 dose [4-6,8, 16,19].   
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1. Sampling Raw textile wastewater sample was taken from  the process wastewater balancing tank of a 
textile industry in which cotton and polyester fabrics are dyed usi ng reactive, dispersive dyes. 
The wastewater is originated fr om bleaching and dyeing processe s. Total process wastewater 
originated from the industry is around 500 m
3 a day. The sample was delivered to the 
laboratory cooled and kept at 4 0C during experimental study. Toxicity tests were done within 
1 day while chemical analyses were realized in 3 days after collection. 
 
2.2. Ozonation (O 3) 
O3 was supplied by an air-ozone generator thro ugh a closed cylindrical pyrex glass reactor 
with a with a diameter of 40 mm and height of  1100 mm. A tubular cylindrical porous diffuser 
was replaced at the bottom of the reactor to transfer input O 3 gas into aqueous solution. 
Teflon tubing line was used for the connection between generator and the reactor (Figure 1). 
The appropriate O 3 concentrations were adjusted by changi ng the electrical current of the 
ozone generator. All experiments were performed at room temperature (25 oC) and at original 
pH of wastewater. After ozonation, the sample s were aerated for 5 min to remove possible 
residual O 3. The O 3 concentrations in input and off-gas  were destroyed by two sequential 
washing bottles containing 250 ml of acidified 2 % KI solution.  Than, a sodium thyosulfite 
titration procedure in the presence of starch as the indicator was performed to measure O 3 
concentration [20,21]. The transfered O 3 (TrO 3) was calculated as the following: 
TrO 3 (mg l-1) = input O 3 concentration–O 3 concentration in off gas              (8) 
To avoid from the dilution errors during kinet ics experiments, ozonation experiment repeated 
at time intervals under same conditions.  The supernatants of the reac tors were filtered OZONE PRE-OXIDATION OF A TE XTILE INDUSTRY WASTEWATER 97
through 0.45 µm Millipore micro filter for COD, col our, absorbance and toxicity measurement. 
A low ozone dose (9.6 mg min-1) was applied differing from the previous studies [8]. 
To evaluate the effect of pH whic h play important role in the process efficiency, in other terms, 
on the reaction kinetics [11,13], the original pH of wastewater adjusted to 5, 9 and 11.0 pH 
values and ozonated at the above  described conditions for 10 min.  Further, the effect of H 2O2 
addition to O 3 oxidation was investigated by adding 600 mg l-1 of H 2O2 at original wastewater 
pH and the raw wastewater was ozonated for 20 min with the same O 3 flow rate.

2.3. Daphnia magna 
The toxicity was measured using 24 h newborn D. magna  at 50% dilution [22]. Raw and 
ozone pre-treated samples were tested within 2 h to avoid any effect of residual O 3 [23]. 
Daphnids were grown in the laboratory at 16  h day light and 8 h da rk periods supplying a 
3000 lux illumination [4,5,8]. They were fed with Selenastrum capricornutum (300.000 cell ml-1) 
and baker’s yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae , 200.000 cells ml-1). Room temperature 
was kept at 20oC ± 1oC and a minimum 6 mg l-1 of dissolved oxygen was supplied by air 
filtered through activated carbon. Experiment s were carried out quadruplicate and 5 daphnids 
being used in each test beaker with  50 ml of effective volume.  All solutions were prepared 
using bidistilled water at pH 8.0. Results were expressed as a per centage of immobilised 
animals after 24 h.  
 
2.4. Analysis  
COD was measured according to ISO6060 [24 ]. All other chemical parameters were 
measured according to Standard Methods [21 ]. Absorbance measurements were made using 
1 cm cyristal cuvette in Pharmacia LKB- Novaspe II model spectrophotometer. HACH-Dr-B 
model spectrophotometer was us ed for colour measurements in  Pt-Co unit. All chemicals 
used were of analytical grade . KI solution used for residual ozone titration was prepared daily. 
 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. General 
The characteristics of the raw wastewater are given in Table 1. The ammonia concentration 
was higher than 25 mg l
-1, was recorded 50% toxic to D. magna  [25] for testing samples 
without dilutions. However, the raw water disp layed 100% toxicity even at 50% dilution when 
the conductivity [6] and ammonia parameters were  below the toxic limits. Therefore, the pre-
ozone oxidation was considered to remove the to xic component such as dyes, were toxic on 
D. magna  [4,5] or auxilaries, found toxic on Vibrio fisheri  [7].

3.2. Ozone treatment and toxicity removal As seen in Figure 1a, TrO
3 dose increased linearly during first 10 min and it was almost stable 
between 15 and 20 min than it continued to incr ease gradually up to 45 min. A cumulative 
TrO 3 concentration was found to be 140.6 mg l-1 at the end of 45 min. TrO 3 rate was 9.5 mg l-1 
min-1 during first minutes tahn it decr eased gradually up to 3.8 mg l-1 min-1 at the end of 20 
min and to 3.125 mg l-1 min-1 at the end of the reac tion (Figure 1b). Absorbances at 450, 500 
and 550 nm were removed at a range of 90-95% during 25 min when 82.5 mg l-1 of ozone 
concentration was transferred. Absorbance removals at 450, 500 and 550 nm obeyed first 
order kinetic as seen in Figure 2. Absorbanc e removal rates (k) are given in Table 2.

Figure 3 illustrates the removal of soluble COD,  colour (Pt-Co) and to xicity tested at 50% 
dilution of pre-ozonated wastewater. More than 90% of colour was removed during 10 min by 
90 mg l-1 of TrO 3. Soluble COD removal fluctuated during oxidation. While a 40% of soluble 
COD removed during first 2.5 than it decreased to 5% at the end of 15 min. It increased again 
to 40% after 45 min. This fluctuation was observed in the previous study [16]. This 
phenomenon was attributed to rapid oxidation of suspended solids whic h contributed to the 
soluble COD by time. However, a gradual increase  in toxicity removal was observed. Toxicity 
removal (60%) was lesser than color removal up to 25-30 min but i increased to 100% by 
soluble COD removal increase at the end of 35 min. This can be explained because the 
chromophor groups in textile dyes causing the effluent co lour can be broken by ozone 
(directly or indirectly), forming smaller molecu les resulting in colourless effluent [11] but the 
by-products which may be still toxic [8].

According to equations 5-7, the addition of H 2O2 was expected to increase the removal of 
toxicity, COD and colour. However, toxicity  removal did not improve during 20 min of 
ozonation at original pH of wastewater. On t he other hand, there was a slight (from 6% to 
7.1%) and significant (from 0 to  10%) COD removal improvement at the end of 10 and 20 min 
respectively. A higher colour removal was recorded starting from 5 min (66%) and it reached 89% at the end of 15 min where toxicity was also removed higher than that of O
3 oxidation 
alone. This result evidenced the relation bet ween colour and toxicity removal [8] which 
seemed slightly related to COD [18].  Meanwhile, according to O 3 oxidation alone, there was 
significant improvement in abs orbance removals (Figure 4).  First order absorbance 
degradation kinetic c onstants at 450, 500 and 550 nm are shown in Table 3.  
OH radical is the most powerful oxidant and its formation in the O 3/H2O2 system is much more 
faster than O 3 treatment. However, the pH affects the decomposition of H 2O2 in the solution. 
Therefore, the optimization of  the pH and the ratio of O 3:H2O2 dose should be detailed further. 
Besides, the applied O 3 dose as well as the oxidation time  should be optimized to evaluate its 
contribution to toxicity removal,  instead causing any toxicity in crease in the effluent [5,12].

10 min ozonation at 5, 9 and 11.0 pH values did not improve the toxicity removal (0% at all pH 
values) as shown in Figure 5. The soluble CO D removal was improved at 3% and 6% at 9.0 
and 11.0 pH values, respectively with respect to O 3 oxidation alone. Because O 3 decomposes 
readily to OH• radicals at high pH (11.0-12.0) whic h are much more powerful than molecular OZONE PRE-OXIDATION OF A TE XTILE INDUSTRY WASTEWATER 101
O3, thus it favours higher TOC removal due to ozonation time [13]. However, no significant 
increase in this study can be a ttributed to the presence of Na 2CO 3, a considerable amount of 
OH• radicals will be scavenged by CO 32- thus wasting OH• oxidant [13]On the other hand, 
lesser colour removal was obtained at 5.0 and 9.0 pH values (48% and 60% respectively) 
while the colour removal was the same at 11.0 pH.

4. CONCLUSIONS This study aimed to evaluate pre-ozonation at a low ozone dose for removal of acute toxicity 
as well as colour and COD in a textile industry wa stewater. The effect of pH varying from 5 to 
11 and the H
2O2 dose of 600 mg l-1 on ozone oxidation were also investigated. Acute toxicity 
of raw and treated samples was monitored using 24 h new born Daphnia magna according to 
standard procedure.  
• By applying 9.5 mg min-1 ozone dose rate for 20 min 60% toxicity removal was obtained 
at 50% dilution when >85% colour (Pt-Co) a nd >90% of absorbance removals were also 
achieved.  
• To obtain 50% toxicity removal correspondi ng 50% removal when the sample will not 
diluted the sample had to be ozonated for 35 min when also >30% soluble COD was 
recorded.  
• The fluctuation in COD removal was relat ed to the rapid oxidation of suspended solids 
resulting in increased soluble COD.  
• The composition of wastewater  which is also related to t he intensity of the colour, was 
related to the acute toxicity of the wastewater.  
• Varying pH form 5 to 11 did not improve the toxicity neither colour removal.  
• Addition of H 2O2 increased the colour as we ll as absorbance removal.  
The results obtained this study are expected to  contribute to contro l the textile industry 
wastewater pollution and to protect aquatic env ironment. However, there is still need some 
further studies to optimize O 3 dose, and ratio of O 3/H2O2. Besides, these kind of studies are 
recommended to be supported by chronic toxici ty experiments to improve the discharge 
standards.
