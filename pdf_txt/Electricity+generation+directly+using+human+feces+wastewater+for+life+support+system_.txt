ABSTRACT 
 
This study aimed to investigate the performance of 
microbial fuel cell (MFC) for simultaneous  
bioremediation of slaught erhouse  wastewater and 
sustainable power gener ation. For the first time, an 
integrated system of tubular type microbial fuel cell 
(MFC) was used in this study. The MFC consisted of 
three concent ric Plexiglas tubes; the inner tube was the 
anaer obic anodic compartment, the mid tube was the 
aerobic biocathodic chamber, and the outer tube act as 
an aerobic bioreactor for extended nitrification 
process. The MFC system was connect ed to a 
complementary external anaerobic bioreactor for 
denitrification process. The microbial fuel cell was 
inocul ated with freshly collected activated sludge and 
was continuousl y fueled with simulated 
slaught erhouse  wastewater. Results revealed that the 
removal efficiency of the chem ical oxygen demand 
(COD) was up to 99%, and the power generation was 
165 m W/m2. Also, results demonstrated that maximum 
removal of NO 3-
 via the denitrification process in the 
final effluent was 94.7%  when the initial concent ration 
of NO 3- in the effluent of the extended bioreactor was 
15.2 mg/L. Approximately; complete recovery of 
nitrogen gas was obtained in the complementary 
external anaer obic bioreactor. These results indicated 
that MFC could be a promising approach for 
slaught erhouse  wastewater bioremediation and 
renew able pow er generation.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that use 
bacteria as a catalyst for conv erting the organic matters into electricity. An MFC typically consists of 
anaer obic anodic and aerobic cathodic cham bers 
separated by ion conduct ing separators. In MFCs, 
microorganisms on the anode surface oxidize 
substrates and gener ate electrons and protons [1]. 
These electrons are transferred to the anod e and pass 
towards the cathode via an external circuit to gener ate 
electricity. The gener ated protons diffuse through the 
solution across the separator towards the cathode. The 
electrons, protons and oxygen combine to form water 
on the cathodic electrode [2]. Previously reported 
studies have mentioned t he importance of  large surface 
area of anode to achieve high power gener ation. 
However, a greater extent of bacterial growth shoul d 
assist in a higher electron transfer to the anod e [3]. On 
the other hand, when wastewater happens  
uncont rolled, it oozes through to streams, rivers, and 
subsoil water causing quality deterioration of these 
media [4]. Slaught erhouse wastewater has been  
classified as indust rial waste, the category of 
agricultural and food indus tries. The agro-indust rial 
wastewaters such as slaught erhouse s, ﬁsheries, and 
seed oil processing are very strong in terms of 
contaminants concen trations and those significantly 
contribute to the overall pollution load imposed on the 
environment. In food i ndust ry, the meat indust ry is one  
of the largest producer s of organic wastes. The 
wastewater gener ated from slaught erhouse  indust ry 
gener ally contain high organic load and the treatment 
is primarily carried out using two major types of 
biological methods;  aerobic and anaer obic. However, 
due to high strength, it is infeasible to treat some 
slaught erhouse  wastewater using aerobic biological 
processes [5, 6]. Effluent from slaught erhouse s and 
packi ng house s are usually heav ily loaded with solids 
and floatable materials (fats), blood, manure, and a 
variety of organic compounds that generated from 
proteins. The composition of effluents depends on the 
type of product ion and facilities. The slaught erhouse

oxygen demand (BOD), and chem ical oxygen demand 
(COD), suspended solids (SS), nitrogen and 
phosphor us, as compared with domestic wastewater 
[6, 7]. As reported by Wiesmann et al. [8], the typical 
values of BOD, COD, and nitrogen in slaught erhouse  
wastewater are 1900, 2579-6650, and 80 mg/L, 
respectively. Wastewaters from slaught erhouse s have 
been cl assified by  the EPA  as one  of the har mful waste 
streams to the envi ronment. The di scharge of  untreated 
slaught erhouse  wastewater contributes to greatly 
degrading the aquat ic env ironment.  
 
This study aimed to design, construct, and evaluate the 
performance of a tubular type MFC for simultaneous  
biotreatment of simulated slaught erhouse  wastewater, 
nitrogen r ecovery, and pow er gener ation. 
 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Design of lab scal e microbi al fuel cell 
An integrated MFC system consisted of tubular type 
microbial fuel cell surrounded by aerobic bioreactor 
and connected to an external anaer obic bioreactor was 
set up as  given in Figs. 1 and 2.  
 
 
 
Fig. 1  Schem atic diagram of the M FC system 
 
The tubular dual-cham ber MFC consisted of three 
concent ric Plexiglas cylinders. The internal, mid, and 
external cylinders represent the anodi c section, 
cathodic compartment, and the extended aerobic 
bioreactor, respectively. The anodi c compartment was 
used for COD removal, whereby, the cathodic section 
was used for nitrification process (NH4+ 
transformation to nitrite and ni trate).

The extended aerobic bioreactor was utilized for 
further nitrification process and complete 
transformation of NH 4+ to nitrite and nitrate.  An 
external cylindrical reactor was integrated with the 
MFC system and was used as an anaer obic bioreactor 
for deni trification pr ocess and nitrogen r ecovery. 
   
Inocul um and s ubstrate 
MFC inocul ated with mixed culture (activated sludge)  
collected from the aeration tank in a local sewage 
treatment plant, Baghdad  (Iraq). The MFC was fueled 
with simulated slaught erhouse wastewater having the 
characteristics given in Tabl e1.  
 
Simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving 
1.278 g/L of sodium acetate (CH3OONa) and 0.191 
g/L of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as a nitrogen 
source in mineral salt media (MSM ) which was 
prepared by dissolving the following constituents in 
distilled water; 0.56 g/L (NH4)2SO 4, 0.20 g/L 
MgS O4.7H2O, 15 mg/L CaCl 2, 1 mg/L FeCl 3.6H2O, 20 
mg/L MnSO 4.H2O, 0.42 g NaHCO3. 
 
 
Analytical analysis and  methodol ogies                  
Chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen 
demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, NO3-, 
NH4+, SO4-2, Cl-, PO4-3, NO3- TDS and electrical 
conduct ivity tests were carried out by the researchers 
on a dai ly basis. The t ests were c onduct ed ev ery day in 
accor danc e to the procedures outlined in the Standard 
ISSN: 1690-4524                              SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 14 - NUMBER 2 - YEAR 2016                             31Methods [9] and the ASTM Manual of Water and

Process  operat ion  
To start up and operate the MFC, one liter of the 
activated sludge w as placed i n the anode c ompartment, 
and was sparged with nitrogen gas for a period of 10 
min to maintain anaer obic environment. During the 
enrichment period, the anod e was periodically fed by 
the mineral salt media (MSM ) solution. After 45 days, 
the simulated slaught erhouse  wastewater was 
continuousl y fed to the anodi c cham ber of MFC at a 
flow rate of 0.38 ml/min to achieve hydraulic retention 
time (HTR) of 30 h. Nitrogen gas was purged into the 
wastewater feed tank to eliminate oxygen content in 
wastewater.  
 
At the same time, an air compressor with a maximum 
flow rate of 10 ml/min was connect ed to the cathode 
compartment to suppl y oxygen in a continuous  
manner . The up flowrate was controlled at 3 ml/min. 
Oxygen conce ntration was monitored continuousl y in 
the anodi c compartment, and the absence of oxygen 
was observed indicating that the flow of oxygen from 
the cathodic to the anodic compartment was negligible 
and the anode compartment can be considered as 
anoxi c. Also, the pH of the solution in the MFCs was 
monitored continuousl y and adjusted to 7-7.2 using 
1M HCl or NaOH solution. The MFC integrated 
system was operated at ambient temperature range of 
28-36 ºC. The cathodic chamber was bio-catalyzed 
with aerobic mixed culture including nitrifying 
bacteria to oxidize the ammonium ions which passed 
from the anodi c section to nitrate ions. The effluent 
from the cathodic cham ber entered the external cylinder which served as aerobic bioreactor for further 
oxidation of NH4+ and NO2- to NO3-. In this aerobic 
bioreactor, almost all the remaining ammonium ions 
were conv erted to nitrate. Then the NO3--loaded  
effluent from the external cylinder was fed to the 
anaer obic bioreactor for the denitrification process. 
The released nitrogen gas was collected by syringe 
and the recov ered nitrogen was analyzed by Gas 
Chromatograph (Packard Mode ls 438A, Pack ard 
instrument company, USA). Daily effluent samples 
were analyzed for determination of ammonium, nitrate 
and COD concent rations. The MFC system was 
continuousl y oper ated for 120 day s.  
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISSCUSION 
 
Performance of MFCs mainly depends  on the nature 
and the com position of  wastewater. However, there are 
many factors that may influence the nitrogen removal 
and recovery in MFC such as oxygen, pH, C/N ratio, 
microbial community composition, reactor design, 
materials and el ectricity gener ation.  
In the present investigation, the performance of the 
sugge sted MFCs was evaluated in terms of COD, 
ammonium and nitrate removal efficiency and power 
gener ation. 
 
Chemical Oxygen  Demand (COD) Removal  
MFC was continuousl y operated for 120 days 
achieving a maximum COD removal efficiency of 
99% as given in Fig. 3. Fast removal of COD was 
observed after 1 day of MFC start up. This could be 
attributed to the fact that the inocul ation of MFC was 
favorable to the constituents of the slaught erhouse 
wastewater. 
 
This observed maximum removal efficiency of COD 
in the current study was higher than the previously 
reported values in the range of (62%–92%) for the 
efficiency of COD removal from other types of 
indust rial wastewaters in MFCs [10-15]. 
Nevertheless, the source and type of substrate, type 
and conce ntration of inocul um, geom etric design of 
microbial fuel cell (MFC), type of electrodes, and 
other parameters highly affect the organics removal 
efficiency. However, the overall efficiencies observed 
for COD removal potentially indicate an effective 
wastewater treatment process.

Ammonium Removal 
The ammonium ions concent rations were exam ined 
during the entire period of operation in each part of the 
MFC-integrated system. The initial ammonium-
nitrogen conce ntration was 50 mg/l, and the removal 
efficiency of ammonium-nitrogen achieved 97%, after 
the first 10 days of continuous operation (Fig. 4). The 
inlet ammonium ions in the anode compartment were 
diffused through the membrane to the cathodic section 
in which the nitrification process occur red in the 
aerated biocathode by a series of bio-electrochem ical 
reactions. This nitrification process was further 
completed in the extended  aerobic bioreactor. After 33 
days of continuous operation, the removal efficiency 
of ammonium-nitrogen  was raised from 86% to 95% 
and the final concent ration of ammonium in the 
effluent was found to be < 0.2 mg/L. These results 
indicated that the ammonium ions acted as electron 
donor  in the nitrification process and continuously 
removed in the cathode compartment. The observed 
removal efficiency of ammonium-nitrogen  could be 
considered comparable to the previously reported 
values up to 99% [16, 17].  
 
Nitrate rem oval  
Nitrate was produce d from the am monium oxidation in 
the bi ocathode and t he ext ended bi oreactor. The ni trate 
concent ration gradually increased from 1.8 to 13.5 mg 
NO3-N /L in the cathode, after 81 days at steady state 
condi tion of continuous operation as shown in Fig. 5. 
The maximum nitrate removal efficiency was 100%  
after 39 days. These results could be achieved due to 
ability of the biofilm to transfer electrons from the 
cathode to the intermediate electron acceptor during 
nitrification mechani sm to increase the yield nitrate 
ions.

However, the overall nitrate ions were reduce d to 
nitrogen gas by the denitrification process by 
heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the external 
anoxi c bioreactor. 
 
Current and p ower genera tion 
Power production started on the first day of operation 
followed by a fluctuated trend of power for a period of 
41 days, and then a steady state condi tion was 
observed at a maximum power and current densities of 
165.22  mW/m2 and 472 mA/m2, respectively (Fig.6). 
Maximum power and current density of the MFC 
integrated system sugge sts that electron transfer was 
also improved due to efficient oxidation of acetate 
substrate and the ammonium removal during 
nitrification process. The high power densities could 
be due to the bet ter electrochem ically active bact eria at 
high ionic strength, and they represent value of power 0102030405060708090100

Fig.7 illustrates the polarization curve plot. It is 
obvious from this plot that the maximum power 
density and current density are 165.22 mW/ m2 and 
472 mA/m2, respectively which were obtained at an 
external resistance of 100 Ω. Thes e results indicated 
that in spite of the high strength of slaught erhous e 
wastewater, the removal efficiency and the 
correspondi ng power generation w ere favorable.

Effect of external resistances  
To investigate the effect of external resistances  on the 
current gener ation, the voltage was recorded with 
different resistances  across the anode and cathode to 
establish the relationshi p between the resistance and 
current. As presented in Fig. 8, at lower external 
resistance, more COD was removed resulted in a 
higher current generation.

4. CONCLUSION 
 
This study demonstrated and evaluated the 
performance of a complete system of tubular type 
mediator-less microbial fuel cell. The MFC was fed 
with simulated slaught erhouse  wastewater for 
simultaneous  wastewater treatment, nitrogen recovery, 
and power gener ation. Results revealed that the 
removal efficiency of the chem ical oxygen demand 
(COD) was up to 99%, and the power generation was 
165.22 mW/m2. On the other hand, the maximum 
removal of NO3- via the denitrification process in the 
final effluent was 94.7%  indicating almost complete 
recovery of nitrogen gas in the complementary 
external anaer obic bioreactor. These results revealed 
that MFC could be a sustainable approach for 
simultaneous  slaught erhouse  wastewater 
bioremediation and pow er generation.
