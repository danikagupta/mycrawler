ABSTRACT
Spirulina is a photosynthetic, filamentous, spiral-shaped, multicellular and green-blue microalga.   The two most important species  
of which are Spirulina maxima and Spirulina platensis.  For these microorganisms cell division occurs by binary fission.   Since 
this material contains chlorophyll a, like higher plants, botanists classify it as a microalga belonging to Chyanophyceae class; but 
according to bacteriologists it is a bacterium due to its prokaryotic structure.   Before Columbus, Mexicans (Aztecs) exploited this  
microorganism as human food; presently, African tribes (Kanembu) use it for the same purpose.   Its chemical composition  
includes  proteins  (55%-70%),  carbohydrates  (15%-25%),  essential fatty acids  (18%)  vitamins, minerals  and  pigments  like  
carotenes, chlorophyll a and phycocyanin.  The last one is used in food and cosmetic industries.    Spirulina is considered as an 
excellent food, lacking toxicity and having corrective properties against viral attacks, anemia, tumor growth and malnutrition.   It 
has been reported in literature that the use of these microalgae as animal food supplement implies enhancement of the yellow  
coloration of skin and eggs yolk in poultry and flamingos, growth acceleration, sexual maturation and increase of fertility in  
cattle.
Key words:  food, microalgae, nutrition, Spirulina.
RESUMEN
Spirulina es una microalga  verde-azul, fotosintética,  filamentosa,  en  forma  helicoidal,  multicelular.   Las  dos especies  más  
importantes son Spirulina máxima y Spirulina platensis.  La división celular se realiza por fisión binaria.   Según los botánicos es  
una microalga debido a la presencia de clorofila a al igual que en plantas superiores.   Pertenece a la división Cianofita y a la clase  
Cianofícea,  pero  según  los  bacteriólogos  es  una  bacteria  debido  a  su  estructura  procarionte.   Se  conoce  desde  tiempos  
precolombinos, que este microorganismo fue utilizado como alimento por tribus mexicanas (Aztecas) y actualmente por tribus  
africanas (Kanembu).  Su composición química incluye proteínas (55%-70%), azúcares (15%-25%),   ácidos grasos esenciales  
(18%),  vitaminas, minerales  y pigmentos como  carotenos,  clorofila  a  y ficocianina;  éste último utilizado en  industrias de  
alimentos y cosméticas.    Se le considera excelente alimento, exento de toxicidad y poseedor de propiedades correctoras de  
ataques virales, anemia, crecimiento tumoral y malnutrición.   La literatura ha reportado, que Spirulina, usada como alimento de  
animales conlleva al realce de la coloración amarilla de piel y yema de huevos, en gallináceos y flamencos; aceleración de  
crecimiento, maduración sexual y aumento de fertilidad, en bovinos.
Palabras clave:  alimento, microalga, nutrición,   Spirulina.HISTORY OF SPIRULINA IN HUMAN CONSUMPTION
It is not known with accuracy when man began to use microalgae.   The current use of these resources has three precedents:  
tradition, scientific and technological development, and the so-called, “green tendency” (Henrikson, 1994).    Bernal Díaz del 
Castillo, a member of Hernán Cortez´s troops, reported in 1521, that S. maxima was harvested from the Lake Texcoco, dried and  
sold for human consumption in a Tenochtitlán (today Mexico City) market, (Figure 1).   This author makes reference to "..small  
cakes made of a mud-like algae, which has a cheese-like flavor, and that natives took out of the lake to make bread,..." (Ciferri,  
1983).  Years later, the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún wrote: “... in certain periods of the year, very soft things are  
gathered from Mexican lakes.   They look like curdles, have a clear blue color, and are used to make bread,   that then eaten 
cooked...”  Natives gave this food the name of Tecuitlalt, which in their language literally means “excrements of stones”.   In 
1524, friar Toribio of Benavente related that the Aztecs harvested the Tecuitlalt, using clothes for pressing and the resulting  
dough was placed on sand and exposed to the sunshine for its drying.   Once Spanish Conquest was over, the topic of the Tecuitlalt  
was not mentioned again, and its elaboration fell into oblivion, possibly due to contagious disease outbreaks, attributed to the new  
customs adopted by the Indians, new foods, and the deep social, political and religious changes brought by the Europeans  
(Henrikson, 1994).
In 1940, the French phycologist P. Dangeard mentioned a cake called dihé, consumed by the people of the Kanembu tribe, near  
the African Lake Chad, in the sub-desert area of Kanem.   Dihé is a hardened cake of blue-green algae, collected at the banks of  
small ponds surrounding the lake and later on sun-dried.   Dangeard studied the dihé samples and concluded that it was a purée of  
a spring form blue algae, main constituent of the phytoplankton in a large number of the African Valley’s lakes (Ciferri, 1983).   
Between 1964 and 1965, the botanist Jean Leonard (Leonard, 1966), who participated in the Belgian Trans-Saharan Expedition,  
was impacted when he observed "a curious bluish green substance, similar to cookies…"   Leonard confirmed that dihé was made 
up of Spirulina, obtained from alkaline lakes in the Kanem desert, northeast of Lake Chad.   This investigator and his colleague  
Cómpere corroborated the previous report by P. Dangeard, from whose observations the chemical analyses of Spirulina began.  
At that time, a group of French investigators studied some samples of Spirulina (S. maxima) that grew abundantly in Lake  
Texcoco, near Mexico City (Ciferri, 1983; Richmond, 1992).
From the scientific point of view, the microalgae cultivation began in 1919 with Warburg’s investigations.   This scientist was well  
known for his works on dense suspensions of Chlorella, as a tool to study photosynthesis.   The easy manipulation under  
controlled conditions and the experimental reproducibility made the microalgae favorite organisms for biochemical, vegetable  
physiology and photosynthetic studies.   In 1950, the United States and Japan began the experimental cultivations of this  
microorganism to investigate its chemical composition and industrial applications.   Japan was the first country to produce  
Chlorella using this microorganism as diet food or a water-soluble extract, denominated Chlorella Growth Factor (Devlin, 1975).   
From 1970, the nutritional and medicinal studies on Spirulina have proliferated (Chamorro,  et al., 1996; Fox, 1993; Hayashi,  
1996a; Richmond, 1992; Saxena, et al., 1983; Schwartz and Shklar, 1987).    In 1970, the German Federal Republic supported  
investigations on human consumption of  Spirulina  in India, Thailand and Peru.   In the Asian countries, the production was  
focused on nutritious support for the undernourished population; in Peru, efforts have been made to industrialize the production of  
Scenedesmus. In 1970, the massive production of microalgae, which could be used in protein production and in water treatment,  
was projected (Ayala and Vargas, 1987; Cañizares, et al., 1993; Ciferri and Tiboni, 1985; Oxa and Ríos, 1998).
Spirulina is marketed and consumed in: Germany, Brazil (Lacaz and Nascimento, 1990), Chile, Spain, France, Canada, Belgium,  
Egypt, United States, Ireland, Argentina, Philippines, India, Africa, and other countries, where public administration, sanitary  
organisms and associations have approved human consumption (Henrikson, 1994).   Some of the best worldwide known Spirulina 
producing companies are:   Earthrise Farms (USA), Cyanotech (USA), Hainan DIC Microalgae Co., Ltd (China), Marugappa 
Chettir Research Center  (India), Genix (Cuba) and Solarium Biotechnology  (Chile) (Ayala, et al., 1988; Jourdan, 1993; Belay,  
1997).
SYSTEMATIC
According to the classification in Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Spirulina (Arthrospira), (Figure 2) belongs to 
the oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria that cover the groups Cyanobacteria and Prochlorales (Castenholz and Waterbury, 1989;  
Whitton, 1992), which are, by phylogeny, related to the sequence of the rARN (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) sub-unit 16S.   As a 
function of the sequence data of this sub-unit and the rRNA sub-unit 5S, these prokaryotes are classified within the eubacteria  
group.
In 1827, P. J. Turpin isolated Spirulina from a fresh water sample (Ciferri, 1983).   In 1844, near the city of Montevideo, Wittrock  
and Nordstedt reported the presence of a helical, septal and green-blue microalgae named Spirulina jenneri f. platensis.  But it was not until 1852, that the first taxonomic report written by Stizenberger, appeared. He gave this new genus the name  
Arthrospira based on the septa presence, helical form and multicellular structure.
Gomont confirmed Stizenberger’s studies in 1892.   This author attributed the aseptate form to the Spirulina genus, and the septal 
form to the  Arthrospira genus.  Geitler in 1932, because of the helical morphology, reunified the members of the two genera  
under  the  designation  Spirulina without  considering  the  septum  presence  only  morphological  similarity.   In  1989,  these 
microorganisms were classified into two genera, according to a suggestion by Gomont in 1892 (Castenholz and Waterbury,  
1989); this classification is currently accepted (Tomaselli, et al., 1996; Vonshak and Tomaselli, 2000).
The systematic position of cyanobacteria has been a matter of discussion, as these photosynthetic organisms were first considered  
algae.  In 1962, a distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes was clearly established. The main difference is based upon the  
presence of cell organelles enveloped by a phospholipidic membrane in eukaryotes.   Stanier and Van Neil (1969) incorporated  
green-blue algae into the prokaryote kingdom and proposed to call these microorganisms cyanobacteria. This designation was  
accepted and first published in 1974 in the Bergey`s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (Guglielmi, et al., 1993).
Spirulina and Arthrospira must be admitted as different genera. The worldwide investigation on microalgae has been carried out  
under the name of  Spirulina; this common designation between scientist and consumers has proved difficult to change.   The 
microalgae exploited as food with excellent health properties belongs to the genus  Arthrospira, but it will probably be called  
Spirulina for some time.
Spirulina and  Arthrospira morphologies are differentiated fundamentally by: helix type, distribution of pores in the cell wall,  
visibility of septos under light microscopy, diameter and fragmentation type of Trichomes (filaments) (Guglielmi, et al., 1993; 
Vonshak and Tomaselli, 2000).   As mentioned,  S. maxima and  S. platensis are the most important species in this genus and  
among  these  exist taxonomic  differences  in filaments,  vacuoles  and  external  cover  or capsule  regularity of each  filament  
(Tomaselli, 1997).
The names cyanobacteria and green-blue algae (Cyanophyceae), are considered compatible terms.   The first one refers to the  
phylogenetic / taxonomic relationship, while the second represents the ecological/biological correlation (Castenholz and  
Waterbury, 1989).
ULTRA-STRUCTURE
Transmission Electron Microscope observations show for Spirulina prokaryotic organization, capsule, pluri-stratified cell wall,  
photosynthetic or thylakoid lamella system, ribosomes and fibrils of DNA region and numerous inclusions.   The capsule has 
fibrillar structure and covers each filament protecting it.   The irregular presence of capsule around the filaments in S. platensis is a 
differentiating morphological characteristic to compare with  S. maxima (Balloni,  et al., 1980; Belay, 1997).  Trichome width 
varies from 6 to 12 μm, and is composed of cylindrical cells.   The helix diameter varies from 30 to 70 μm (Tomaselli, 1997); the  
trichome length is about 500 μm, although in some cases when stirring of culture is deficient the length of filament reaches  
approximately 1 mm. It is very important to explain that the helical shape of Spirulina in liquid culture is changed to spiral shape  
in solid media (Figure 3). These changes are due to hydratation or dehydratation of oligopeptides in the peptidoglycan layer  
(Ciferri, 1983).
Spirulina cell wall is formed by four numbered layers, from the inner most outward as: LI, LII, LIII and LIV.    All these layers are 
very weak, except layer LII made up of peptidoglycan, substance that gives the wall its rigidity (Ciferri, 1983).   The LI layer 
contains β-1,2-glucan, a polysaccharide not very digestible by human beings.   However, the low concentration (<1%) of this  
layer, thickness its (12 nm), and the protein and lipo-polysaccharide nature of the LII layer are favorite reasons for the easy  
human digestion of Spirulina  (Balloni, et al., 1980).
In this microorganism chlorophyll a, carotenes and phycobilisomes, which contain phycocyanin (blue pigment) are located in the  
thylakoid system or photosynthetic lamellas.   The inter-thylakoid space is limited by the presence of electronically transparent  
protein gas vesicles, with the cylindrical form that give Spirulina its floating capacity (Ciferri, 1983).
Ribosomes and fibrils of DNA region are generally of central localization (Balloni, et al., 1980).
Spirulina contains numerous characteristic peripheral inclusions associated to thylakoids. Those are: cyanophycin granules,  
polyhedral bodies, polyglucan granules, lipid granules, and polyphosphate granules (Balloni, et al., 1980; Ciferri, 1983).  The 
cyanophycin granules, or reserve granules, are important due to their chemical nature and a series of pigments.   The polyhedral 
bodies or carboxysomes mainly contain   the enzyme ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase that allows the fixation of CO 2 in 
photosynthetic organisms and probably carry out a reserve function.   The polyglucan granules or glycogen granules or α-granules 
are glucose polymers, small, circular and widely diffused in the interthylacoidal space.   The lipid granules, β-granules or osmophile granules form the reservation deposit, constituted by poly- β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), found only in prokaryotes.   PHB 
acts as a carbon and energy reserve (Vincenzini, et al., 1990).
LIFE CYCLE
A  fundamental  aspect  of  Spirulina biology  is  its  life  cycle  (Figure  4)  due  to  the  taxonomic,  physiologic  and  cultivation  
implications (Ciferri, 1983; Richmond, 1984).   This period is summarized in three fundamental stages:  trichomes fragmentation, 
hormogonia cells enlargement and maturation processes, and trichome elongation.   The mature trichomes are divided into several  
small filaments or hormogonia through previous formation of specialized cells, necridium cells, in which the cell material is  
reabsorbed allowing fragmentation.   The number of cells in the hormogonias is increased by binary fission.   For this process, the 
trichomes grows lengthwise and takes their helical form (Balloni, et al., 1980).
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Since 1970, Spirulina has been analyzed chemically.   It has been shown to be an excellent source of proteins, vitamins and  
minerals (Switzer, 1980).
Proteins.  Spirulina has a high protein concentration (60%-70% of its dry weight), (Table 1) (Ciferri, 1983).   Spirulina is useful in 
human nutrition, due to the high quality and quantity of its protein.   The nutritive value of a protein is related to the quality of  
amino acids, digestibility coefficient, as well as by its biological value (Dillon and Phan, 1993; Richmond, 1992).   Spirulina 
contains essential amino acids; the highest values are leucine (10.9% of total amino acids), valine (7.5%), and isoleucine (6.8%),  
(Cohen, 1997).  Denaturation of Spirulina protein is observed when algae are heated above 67 ºC, at neutral aqueous solution.   
Hydrophobic regions interaction during heating and hydrogen bonds formation during cooling are aggregation and gelation  
factors of Spirulina protein  (Chronakis, 2001).
Vitamins.  Among food, Spirulina has a relative high provitamin A concentration (Belay, 1997), (Table 2).   An excessive dose of 
β-carotene may be toxic, but when the β-carotene is ingested from the Spirulina or another vegetable it is usually harmless since  
the human organism only converts into vitamin A the quantity it needs (Henrikson R., 1994).   Spirulina is a very rich source in  
vitamin B12, and that is a reason why these cyanobacteria is of great value for people needing supplements in the treatment of  
pernicious anemia (Richmond, 1992; Becker, 1984; Belay, 1997).
Lipids.  Spirulina contains 4-7% lipids.   Spirulina has essential fatty acids: linoleic acid (LA) (C 18:2)Δ9,12 and  γ-linolenic acid 
(C18:3)Δ9,12,15 (GLA) (Othes and Pire, 2001), (Table 3).   The latter is claimed to have medicinal properties and is required for  
arachidonic acid and prostaglandin synthesis (Dubacq and Pham-Quoc, 1993).   GLA lowers low-density lipoprotein, being 170-
fold more effective than LA (Cohen, 1997).
Minerals.  Iron in some nutritional complements is not appropriately absorbed.   Iron in  Spirulina is 60% better absorbed than  
ferrous sulfate and other complements.   Consequently, it could represent an adequate source of iron in anemic pregnant women  
(Pyufoulhoux, et al., 2001) (Table 4).
Carbohydrates.  Spirulina platensis contains about 13.6% carbohydrates; some of these are glucose, rhamnose, mannose, xylose  
and galactose (Shekharam, et al., 1987).  Spirulina does not have cellulose in its cell wall, a feature that makes it an appropriate  
and important foodstuff for people with problems of poor intestinal absorption, and geriatric patients (Richmond, 1992).   A new 
high  molecular  weight  polysaccharide,  with  immunostimulatory  activity  has  been  isolated  from  Spirulina  and  is  called 
“Immulina”.  This highly water-soluble polysaccharide represents between 0.5% and 2.0% (w/w) of the dry microalgae (Pugh, et 
al., 2001).
Nucleic acids content.  One of the main concerns about the consumption of microorganisms is their high content of nucleic acids  
that may cause disease such as gout.   Spirulina contains 2.2%-3.5% of RNA and 0.6 %-1% of DNA, which represents less than  
5% of these acids, based on dry weight.   These values are smaller than those of other microalgae like Chlorella and Scenedesmus 
(Ciferri, 1983).
Pigments. Some natural pigments are found in Spirulina, (Table 5).  These pigments are responsible for the characteristic colors  
of certain flamingo species that consume these cyanobacteria in the African Valley.   This knowledge has promoted the use of this  
microorganism as source of pigmentation for fish, eggs (Ciferri, 1983; Saxena,  et al., 1983; Henrikson, 1994) and chicken.   
Spirulina  also increases the yellowness and redness of broiled chicken due to accumulation of zeaxanthin (Toyomizu,  et al., 
2001).
SOME Spirulina CONSUMPTION BENEFITSStudies have shown that  Spirulina consumption during 4 weeks reduces serum cholesterol levels in human beings by 4.5%  
(Henrikson, 1994) and significantly reduces body weight by 1.4 +/- 0.4 Kg after four weeks (Becker, et al., 1986).   These reports 
indicated no changes in clinical parameters (blood pressure) or in biochemical variables (hematocrite, hemoglobin, white blood  
cells, sedimentation rate) and absence of adverse effects.   The reduction of cholesterol is partly owed to the  γ-linolenic acid 
cyanobacteria high content (Henrikson, 1994).
The β-carotene is one of the most effective substances to counteract those free radicals that alter cells causing cancer (Fedkovic,  
et al., 1993; Schwartz, et al., 1990).  Studies at the Harvard University School of Dental Medicine found a reduction in mouth  
cancer when β-carotene extracts, obtained from Spirulina, are consumed.  The β-carotene solution applied to oral cancer tumors  
in hamsters reduced the tumor number and size and in some cases these disappeared (Schwartz and Shklar, 1987; Schwartz, et al., 
1988). Spirulina extract induces the tumor necrosis factor in macrophages, suggesting a possible tumor destruction mechanism  
(Shklar and Schwartz, 1988).
An extract of sulfated polysaccharides, called Calcium-Spirulan (Ca-SP), made up of rhamnose, ribose, mannose, fructose,  
galactose, xylose, glucose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, and calcium sulfate, obtained from  Spirulina, showed activity 
against HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus, Human Cytomegalovirus, Influenza A Virus, Mumps Virus and Measles Virus (Henrikson R,  
1994; Hayashi, 1996b).   Current investigation in this field is searching for extracts that inhibit the AIDS virus replication  
(Ayehunie, et al., 1998) and allows these patients to improve their health.
Spirulina excretes variable quantities of products from its metabolism such as: organic acids, vitamins, and phytohormones.   Cell 
extract of S. maxima has shown antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtillis, Streptococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
and Candida albicans. The presence of high quantities of acrylic acid in Spirulina was substantiated at the end of the seventies.   
This substance shows anti-microbial activity, in a 2 mg/L of biomass concentration.   Propionic, benzoic and mandelic organic  
acids were also found (Balloni W. et al., 1980).
Lactobacillus population in human gastrointestinal tract is increased by Spirulina consumption.  This means: food digestion and  
absorption improvement, intestinal protection against bacterial infections and immune system stimulation (Henrikson, 1994;  
Schiffrin, et al., 1997).  Immune system modulation is due to interference on production and NK cytotoxicity (Hirahashi, et al., 
2002).
Spirulina  reduces:  hepatic damage due to drug abuse and heavy metal exposure, inflammatory response (Richmond, 1984;  
González,  et  al.,  1999),  cells  degeneration  (Bulik,  1993),  anaphylactic  reaction  (Yang,  et  al.,  1997),  Bitot’s  spots,  and  
Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 radiation in Chernobyl children (Henrikson, 1994).   
Spirulina contains vitamin A, important in preventing eye diseases; iron and vitamin B 12, useful in treating hypoferric anemia and  
pernicious  anemia,  respectively;  γ-linolenic  acid,  appropriate  in  treatment  of  atopic  child  eczema  therapy;  to  alleviate  
premenstrual syndrome, and in immune system stimulation (Pascaud, 1993).   Spirulina also has a positive effect on cardiac  
disease, Parkinson`s disease, malnutrition, sclerosis (Richmond A, 1992; Fox, 1993, Fox, 1998; Thein, 1993) and wounds cure  
(Richmond, 1992). 
Other benefits are attributed to  Spirulina:   anti-arthritic effect due to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of  
phycocyanin (Ramirez,  et al., 2002); anti-atherogenic property (Kaji,  et al., 2002), tumor burden inhibition (Dasgupta,  et al., 
2001); chemo protective and radio-protective effect (Zhang, et al., 2001); and antioxidant activity on lead-induced toxicity in rats  
(Upasani, et al., 2001).
In Mexico, Spirulina is used in to enrich candies.   In Australia and New Zealand beverages of this substance are marketed.   In 
Japan, India, and Singapore Spirulina-enriched appetizers are sold specially to pregnant women, children and elderly.   Spirulina is 
not only food, but also a natural coloring in Japanese chewing gums.   Countries like Chile, France, Cuba, Germany, Switzerland,  
Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand market food complements,  
which include Spirulina as the main component.   Internationally, skin care products, shampoos, dyes, masks, creams and tonics  
containing this microorganism are marketed.   In Sweden low calorie bread enriched with  Spirulina  is sold, and in France a  
vegetable pâté, made of Spirulina, is sold as bread spread (Henrikson, 1994).   
Many  agricultural  and  industrial  materials  are  being  prepared  from  cyanobacteria.  These  include:  biomass  (Ciferri,  1983;  
Richmond  and  Becker,  1984;  Shang-Hao,  1988;  Thein,  1993),  restriction  nucleases  (Kawamura,  et  al.,  1986),  antifungal, 
antineoplastic (Moore, et al., 1984; Clardy, et al., 1990), antimicrobial (Gerwick, et al., 1987), anti-leukemia (Moore, et al., 1977) 
and herbicidal compounds (Entzeroth, et al., 1985).  Some pigments have been produced from cyanobacteria (Jung and Dailey,  
1989;  Paniagua-Michel  and  Sasson,  1995).    Other  products from  microalgae  are:   amino acids  (Kerby,  et al., 1988),  and 
fertilizers (Boussiba, 1988).Spirulina has been studied as an animal cell-growth stimulant (Kerby and Rowell, 1992) and in the treatment of residual waters  
using alginate  (Cañizares,  et al., 1993; Patnaik,  et al., 2001).  Phycocyanin  shows activity on vegetable  cell cultures with  
production of secondary metabolites as anthocyanin (Ramachandra, et al., 1996).  This pigment has the ability to inhibit oxidative  
damage in DNA and hence it may be used as a therapeutic agent (Bhat, et al., 2001).
Spirulina is used in Japan and Taiwan as aquarium fish food, in United States to enhance color, speed the growth and sexual  
maturation of canaries and exotic birds (Saxena, et al., 1983).  Cattle and horse breeders affirm that when adding Spirulina to 
silage, the quantity of sperms in males and the fertility in females are increased (Henrikson, 1994 ).  Labeo rohita (rohu), an 
Indian carp, showed greater growth after being fed with Spirulina (Nandeesha, et al., 2001).  In chickens, Spirulina increases the 
mononuclear phagocyte system function thereby enhancing their disease resistance (Al-Batshan, et al., 2001).
TOXICOLOGY
This microorganism in general terms do not exceed the metal concentration limits recommended by international agencies.   But 
due to the use of fertilizers, possible water and environmental pollution optimal quality control and periodic revisions of this  
cyanobacteria culture is necessary to detect high metal concentration values (Chamorro, et al., 1996).  Studies in Mexico showed  
that the administration of S. platensis to mice does not cause embryonic or fetal damages (Chamorro, et al., 1989; Chamorro and 
Salazar, 1990).
Absence of phycotoxins in  Spirulina is an advantage with respect to  Microcystis,  Anabaena  and  Aphanizomenon, fresh water 
cyanobacteria that have caused death in livestock and allergic or gastrointestinal reactions in human beings (Chamorro, et al., 
1996).
Chronic and sub-chronic toxicity studies have not revealed toxic effects by Spirulina.  The lethal dose (LD50) of Spirulina has not 
been determined, since it would be necessary to dispense high quantities in one single dose (Chamorro,  et al., 1996; Switzer, 
1980).
PRODUCTION
The main commercial large-scale culture of microalgae started in the early 1960s in Japan with the culture of Chlorella, followed 
by Spirulina in the early 1970s at Lake Texcoco, Mexico.   The third major microalgae industry was established in Australia in  
1986.  Commercial production of Dunaliella salina was cultured as a source of β-carotene (Borowitzka, 1998).
The first plant in USA ( Earthrise Farms) for the exploitation of Spirulina, built in 1981 in California, emerged as the result of a  
research work on its culture by Dainippon Ink & Chemicals, Inc. of Japan and Proteus Corporation of California (Vonshak, 1997),  
(Table 6).  Spirulina grows quickly and produces 20 times more protein by surface unit that soy beams (Henrikson, 1994).   When 
comparing the growth of  Spirulina and the agricultural crop cycles, the difference in the time of production is noticeable.   In 
agriculture, the harvest is obtained after several months of cultivation, while Spirulina is produced continually (Switzer, 1980).
Production process of Spirulina requires clonal or unialgal cultures (isolation of a single algal unit or trichome), (Vonshak, 1984;  
González,  et al., 1995;  Hoshaw and Rosowski, 1979).   The method begins with the determination of physical and chemical  
parameters of the water sample, which constitutes the main ingredient of the growth medium.   The  Spirulina samples should 
remain under dim light or in darkness and at 20-25°C; freezing temperature is not recommended because it favors lysis and death  
(Rippka, 1988).  Isolation of the microorganism is carried out under an intensely lighted   microscope and with a capillary pipette  
so that one and only one filament is selected (Ayala,   2000) by its morphological attributes (color, size of trichomes, length and  
apical filament characteristics).   If axenic cultures, specific for physiologic and biochemical studies of algae, are wanted, special  
treatments such as: centrifugation followed by ultrasonic treatments with antibiotics and potassium tellurite are required (Hoshaw  
and Rosowski, 1979).
Cyanobacteria are grown in many liquid and solid culture media such as:   BG11, ASM-1, Z8, SAG, BBM, AA, KMC, Kn Cg-10,  
D (Rippka, 1988) and Spirulina grows in culture media such as:   Zarrouk, SSM (Sea Saltpeter Medium) , Vonshak, Spirulina and  
AO (Ogawa and Aiba, 1977; Ayala and Bravo R, 1982).
Zarrouk medium (Zarrouk, 1966; Borowitzka, 1992) is frequently used during the isolation process and the SSM medium is  
preferred in the industrial production stage (Ayala, 2000).   Eight mayor medium factors influence the productivity of Spirulina: 
luminosity (photo-period 12/12, 4 luxes), temperature (30°C), inoculation size, stirring speed, dissolved solids (10-60 g/L), pH  
(8.5-10.5), water quality, macro and micronutrient presence, (C, N, P, K, S, Mg, Na, Cl, Ca and Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, W) (Ciferri,  
1983; Ayala, 1998).  
Spirulina production may be carried  out in closed and open systems.   The first one involves laboratory photo bioreactors  
(Materassi, et al., 1980; Torzillo and Carlozzi, 1996;   Watanabe and Hall, 1996).   This is not used in industrial production.   The open system, denominated raceway (Figure, 5), due to its low production cost, easy handling and high production of biomass, is  
frequently chosen for industrial production. This method uses a pond with a central islet, a motor operating a paddle wheel which  
allows continuous displacement of the liquid culture in the peripheral channel.   Paddle wheels speed in the order of 20 cm s-1 has 
been recommended.  If necessary, plates may be introduced to avoid dead point formation.   When this type of reactor is located  
outdoors the following factors should be considered as modifiers on the cyanobacteria growth:   the medium composition (Ciferri,  
1983), evaporation speed, culture contamination, and temperature (35°C–38ºC)(Walmsley, et al., 1981).
Productive process has five stages:  Filtration and Cleaning , a nylon filter at the entrance of the water pond is needed;  Pre-
concentration, to obtain algal biomass which is washed to reduce salts content; Concentration, to remove the highest possible  
amount of interstitial water (located among the filaments);  Neutralization, to neutralize the biomass with the addition of acid  
solution; Disintegration, to break down trichomes by a grinder; Dehydration by spray-drying; this operation has great economic  
importance since it involves about 20-30% of the production cost (Ayala and Laing, 1990); Packing is done in sealed plastic bags  
to avoid hygroscopic action on the dry Spirulina; and Storage, in corrugate cardboard boxes, and in fresh, dry, dim, pest-free, and  
clean storeroom, preventing Spirulina pigments from deteriorating (Ayala, 1998).   Quality control for Spirulina as a food includes 
microbiological standard tests, chemical composition test, and test for heavy metals, pesticides and extraneous materials (insect  
fragments, rodent hair and feather fragments) (Belay, 1997).
The above-mentioned facts stress Spirulina is a non-noxious microorganism with a very high nutritional and economic potential  
for animal consumption including man.   It may be cultured in laboratory, pilot plant and at industrial scale in a simple way.   
However, like in all food processing, it is necessary to maintain good production conditions and quality.
CONCLUSIONS
A bibliographical review on  Spirulina identifies this microorganism as microalgae or bacteria, by botanists and bacteriologist  
respectively.   This study has revealed a rather significant number of research studies done on its properties, some of these are  
related to human and animal food uses.     Spirulina is claimed as a non-toxic, nutritious food, with some corrective properties  
against viral attacks, anemia, tumoral growth and low prostaglandins production in mammals; and as a source of the yellow  
coloration of egg yolk when consumed by hens, and a growth, sexual maturation and fertility factor, in bovines.   This material 
contains proteins, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, carotenes, chlorophyll a and phycocyanin.   Spirulina 
may be produced in rather simple pilot plants or industrial installations if good conditions and quality controls are assured.
