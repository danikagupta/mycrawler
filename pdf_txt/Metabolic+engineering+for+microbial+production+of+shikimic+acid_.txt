Introduction  
 
Shikimic acid (SA) is a high valued 
compound used in the synthesis of antiviral 
drugs. It is a key starting material utilized in 
the synthesis of neuraminidase inhibitor 
oseltamivir -phosphate, which is developed 
under the name of Tami flu for the treatment 
of antiviral infections. (Kramer et al, 
2003,Ahn et al, 2008)  
 
Shikimic acid is an attractive chiral synthon 
with its highly func tionalized; six -membered 
carbocyclic ring and multiple asymmetric 
centers. A metabolic intermediate of 
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, shikimic   
 
 
 
 
 
 
acid has emerged as an essential chiral 
starting material in the synthesis of 
neuraminidase inhibitors  effective in the 
treatment of influenza. (Kim et al, 1997, 
Rohloff et al, 1998; Chandran et al ,2003). 
Chiral, as well as aromatic chemicals can 
also be synthesized from shikimic acid. For 
example   acid catalyzed dehydration of 
shikimic acid produces p -hydroxybenzoic 
acid. P -Hydroxybenzoic acid, which has an 
annual production of 7×106 kg,, is the key 
precursor to parabens and a monomer used 
in the synthesis of liquid crystal polymers.

Shikimic acid (SA) is a high valued compound used in the synthesi s of antiviral 
drugs. It is a key starting material utilized in the synthesis of neuraminidase 
inhibitor oseltamivir -phosphate, which is developed under the name of Tami flu for 
the treatment of antiviral infections. Shikimic acid is obtained via tedious m ulti-
step isolation procedures from plants. The extraction yields of shikimic acid from 
plants are low therefore; it would be desirable to provide an alternate method to 
produce large quantities of shikimic acid. The main alternative to this process is 
fermentation using microorganisms producing shikimic acid. In the present work, 
20 coliforms isolates  were tested for its ability to produce shikimic acid. To 
increase the production of shikimic acid, 8 isolates producing shikimic acid more 
than 8 ug per ml w ere exposed to U.V.rays for different intervals of time. Two 
mutants in which the production was increased by 20% and 27% were selected 
further for optimization of fermentation condition.

combinatorial library of molecules. (Shirai 
et al , 2001; Escalante et al,2010).  
 
Shikimic acid is obtained via tedious multi -
step isolation procedures from plants. 
Currently shikimic acid is produced from the 
fruit of Illicium anisatu m or star anise, a 
Chinese plant. (Haslem, E. 1993)Against the 
fear of spread of potential flu pandemic, 
making large quantities of drug is a 
challenge before the pharmaceutical industry 
.Star anise is harvested only from March to 
May. The extraction yield s of shikimic acid 
from plants are low because most of the 
secondary metabolites accumulate at low 
levels in plant cells. (Raghavendra et al, 
2009; Nakagawa, et al 2011) Therefore, it 
would be desirable to provide an alternate 
method to produce large quant ities of 
shikimic acid.  
 
The main alternative to this process is 
fermentation using microorganisms 
producing shikimic acid. According to a 
2003 review, fermentation of shikimic acid 
could provide, in principle, an unlimited 
supply of the raw material. And  researchers 
are hard at work to improve the fermentation 
process, making it even easier to generate 
the drug's key ingredient.  Shikimic acid is a 
natural intermediate in the formation of 
microbial amino acids. It is accumulated in 
the small quantities in many Gram negative 
bacteria in which aromatic amino acid 
biosynthetic pathway is functional ( Zhou et 
al, 2008; Chemler et al , 2008 ; Marner W. 
D. 2009).In this context,  the present work is 
aimed to study the  production of shikimic 
acid from the coliform s isolated from natural 
environment.  
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Isolation and identification of coliforms  
 
As per literature reports shikimic acid is 
produced by coliform group of bacteria therefore in the present work coliform 
bacteria were used for producti on of 
shikimic acid. Coliforms were isolated by 
inoculating one ml water sample obtained 
from different sources like river, sewage and 
effluent in 5 ml of MacConkey’s broth. 
Tubes were incubated at 37 0C for 24 hrs. A 
loopful from the tubes showing gas 
production was inoculated on MacConkey’s 
agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 0C 
for 24 hrs. Organisms producing dark pink 
colored colonies were selected as coliforms. 
Total 20 isolates were selected for these 
studies. The isolates were identified up to 
species level on the basis of cultural, 
morphological and biochemical 
characterization.  
 
Production of shikimic acid  
 
Inoculum preparation  
 
A loopful of 24 hours growth of each 
coliform isolate from nutrient agar slant was 
inoculated in 10 ml of inoculum me dium 
having composition per  liter, Bacto -
Tryptone ( 10 gms ), Bacto -Yeast Extract ( 5 
gm ), NaCl ( 5 gms ), pH 7. All the tubes 
were incubated at 37 0C for 24 hrs.   
 
Production of shikimic acid  
 
Five percent inoculum was transferred in the 
production medi um having composition per  
liter, Glucose ( 50.00 gms ), Monopotassium 
Phosphate  ( 1 gm ), Ammonium Sulphate ( 
25 gms ), Magnesium Sulphate - 7 H 2O ( 
00.40 gm ), L – Tyrosine ( 00.10 gm ), L – 
Tryptophan ( 00.10 gm ), L – Phenylalanine 
( 00.10 gm ), P – Aminobenzoic Acid ( 
01.00 mg ), Ferrous Sulphate - 7 H 2O  ( 
09.90 mg ), Manganese Sulphate - 4 H 2O ( 
07.20 mg ), Zinc Chloride ( 25.00 mg ), 
Copper Sulphate - 7 H 2O ( 00.50 mg ), 
Calcium Carbonate ( 20.00 gms ), pH 7.  All 
the flasks were incubated at 37 0C for 24 Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 980-987 
 
 982 hours. After incubation 10 ml sample was 
removed, extracted and used for assay 
purpose.  
 
Extraction of Shikimic acid  
 
After incubation period of 24 hours, 10 ml 
of fermented broth was removed aseptically 
and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 
minute s. Supernatant was collected and used 
as a product for the assay purpose.  
 
Detection of Shikimic acid  
 
Shikimic acid produced was detected by 
Periodate method (Gaitonde and Gordon, 
1957). In this method shikimic acid is 
oxidized by periodic acid to give t rans-
aconitic acid and a dialdehyde. In alkaline 
condition it produces yellow colour which is 
measured UV spectrophotometrically.  
 
Quantification of shikimic acid  
 
To 3 ml of supernatant 0.5 ml of 1% 
periodic acid was added. After mixing, the 
mixture was i ncubated for 3 hours at 37 0C. 
Then 0.5 ml of 1N NaOH was added and 
immediately 0.3 ml of 0.1 M Glycine was 
added and within 10 minutes. Optical 
density was read at 380 nm in UV 
spectrophotometer. Concentration of 
Shikimic acid was determined by using 
standard shikimic acid (Hi Media Pvt. Ltd.) 
in 1ug to 10 ug per ml range.  
 
Mutation of selected isolates:  
 
To increase the yield of shikimic acid, 
mutation was carried by physical 
mutagenesis using UV irradiation. Seven 
Isolates (C1, C8, C9, C12, C16, C18 and 
C19) giving maximum production of 
shikimic acid were selected for the mutation. 
All selected isolates were streak inoculated 
on fresh sterile nutrient agar slants for the preparation of active culture. After obtaining 
active culture purity was checked and one 
loopful culture of each isolate was 
inoculated in 5 ml of sterile nutrient broth 
separately and incubated for 24 hours. After 
incubation serial dilutions of inoculum were 
prepared. 10-5 dilution of every culture was 
spread inoculated on sterile MacConk ey’s 
agar plates. These plates were exposed to 
UV rays for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 seconds 
respectively along with control. All plates 
were incubated at 37 0C for 24 hours. After 
incubation well isolated, dark pink coloured 
colonies were selected as mutants. All 
selected mutant colonies were tested for 
shikimic acid production. And results were 
compared with wild isolates.  
 
Optimization of fermentation condition:  
 
Various parameters that enhance the 
production of shikimic acid were 
investigated by optimizing t he fermentation 
conditions. The parameters studied were 
incubation period (0 to 120 hrs), 
concentration of inoculum (1 to 7%), effect 
of different carbon and nitrogen sources and 
concentration of glucose (1 to 7%). 
Different carbon sources used were glucos e, 
fructose, lactose, sucrose, maltose and 
glycerol while nitrogen sources studied were 
ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, 
ammonium chloride, asparagine, urea and 
peptone.  
 
Partial Purification of Shikimic acid  
 
Partial purification of shikimic acid was 
carried out using ethanol. 5 ml of extracted 
sample and 5 ml of ethanol was mixed in a 
tube. After proper shaking precipitate 
formed was kept in deep fridge for 
overnight. Supernatant and precipitate was 
separated. Supernatant was kept for 
evaporation.  50 % of evaporated sample was 
used for the thin layer chromatography.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 980-987 
 
 983 Detection of Shikimic ac id by thin layer 
chromatography  
 
Thin layer chromatography was performed 
on silica gel TLC plates (Misra and Dey,    
2013). Standard shikimic acid purchased 
from Hi  Media Pvt. Ltd and partially 
purified sample obtained in the present work 
were manually spotted using a capillary.  
Plates were developed in Ethyl acetate : 
Methanol : Formic acid : Water ( 8:1:1:1) to 
the top and dried at 1100C for 10 minutes 
before use . Dried plates were sprayed with 
60% aqueous sulphuric acid and observed 
for development of brown charred spots. Rf 
values were calculated and compared with 
standard.  
 
Result and Discussion  
 
20 coliforms were isolated from water 
samples collected from  different sources like 
sewage, river water and effluent. All these 
isolates were identified on the basis of 
cultural, morphological and biochemical 
characterization.  The isolates identified 
were Escherichia coli (9), Citrobacter Spp. 
(6 ) and Enterobacter spp . ( 5 ) by referring 
Bergey’s Manual of Systematic 
Bacteriology.  
 
Ability of shikimic acid production of all 20 
isolates was checked. Quantification of 
shikimic acid was done by using periodic 
acid assay method. Out of 20 isolates 7 
isolates giving product ion of shikimic acid 
more than 8 ug/ml (C1, C8, C9, C12, C16, 
C18, and C19), were selected for the further 
studies. The yield of shikimic acid in ug/ml 
of these isolates were   11.4, 10, 12.2, 11.0, 
8.2, 12.5, 8.3  respectively (Figure 1).  To 
improve the p roduction of shikimic acid, 
mutation of selected 7 isolates was done by 
physical mutagenesis using UV radiation. 11 
mutants obtained on MacConkey’s agar 
plate were selected for shikimic acid production. The production of shikimic acid 
was increased in M2 a nd M4 mutants by 
20.17% and 27.19% compared with its wild 
strain (Figure 2).  
 
While optimizing the fermentation 
condition, M2 and M4 mutants and its wild 
strain C1 Escherichia coli  were selected.   
The maximum production of shikimic acid 
was obtained afte r 24 hours in all three 
strains (Figure 3). The production was 
decreased after 48 hours. 5% concentration 
of inoculum gave maximum production of 
shikimic acid (Figure 4).The effect of 
carbon sources on shikimic acid production 
showed, glucose and fructose as better 
carbon sources than lactose, sucrose and 
maltose (Figure 5). Among nitrogen sources, 
maximum production was observed with 
asparagine and ammonium sulphate.( Figure 
6). The production was not increased in 
inorganic salts like ammonium chloride and  
ammonium nitrate or organic nitrogen 
source like urea and peptone. 5% 
concentration of glucose gave maximum 
production of shikimic acid in both the 
mutants and its wild strain, C1 (Figure 7). 
Higher yield of shikimic acid with 
5%glucose and asparagine (4. 5%) as 
nitrogen source was also reported by 
Tripathi et al (2013).  
 
Partial purification of extract obtained by the 
fermentation was carried out by ethanol. The 
presence of shikimic acid in the extract was 
confirmed by TLC. Charred brown coloured 
spots com parable with standard having Rf of 
0.58 lying very close to standard value of 
0.59 were obtained.  So the present work 
concludes that Escherichia coli isolated 
from natural environment and its mutants 
have a potential of shikimic acid production. 
As shikimi c acid is a high valued 
intermediate in various antiviral drug 
preparations the present work will be of 
much significance against the fear of spread 
of swine flu.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 980-987
