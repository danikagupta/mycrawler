The misuse of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has drawn a growing concern
worldwide for its psychophysiological impacts on humans. MDMA abusers are often accompanied
by long-term serotonergic neurotoxicity, which is associated with reduced density of cerebral
serotonin transporters (SERT) and depressive disorders. Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturalpolyphenolic phytoalexin that has been known for its antidepressant and neuroprotective
effects. However , biological targets of RSV as well as its neuroprotective effects against MDMAwww.elsevier.com/locate/euroneuro

SERT using small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) with the SERT radioligand, N,N-
dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[18F]ﬂuorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[18F]-ADAM) and investigated the
protection of RSV against the acute and long-term adverse effects of MDMA. We found that RSVexhibit binding potentials to SERT in vivo in a dose-dependent manner with variation among
brain regions. When the MDMA-treated rats (10 mg/kg, s.c.) were co-injected with RSV (20 mg/
kg, i.p.) twice daily for 4 consecutive days, MDMA-induced acute elevation in plasma
corticosterone was signi ﬁcantly reduced. Further , 4-[
18F]-ADAM PET imaging revealed that
RSV protected against the MDMA-induced decrease in SERT availability in the midbrain and the
thalamus 2 weeks following the co-treatment. The PET data were comparable to the
observation from the forced swim test that RSV suf ﬁciently ameliorated the depressive-like
behaviors of the MDMA-treated rats. Together , these ﬁndings suggest that RSV is a potential
antidepressant and may confer protection against neurobiological and behavioral changes
induced by MDMA.&2015 Elsevier B.V . and ECNP . All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) known as
ecstasy is a ring-substituted amphetamine analog which is
commonly used as a recreational drug. MDMA abuse is a growingconcern around the world because its short-term euphoric
effects have been shown to be associated with long-term
serotonergic neurotoxicity ( Lanteri et al., 2014 ;McCann
et al., 1998 ;Parrott, 2013 ). Human and animal studies suggest
that MDMA may cause a long-term decrease in serotonin
transporter (SERT) density and consequently promote
depressive-like behaviors ( Curran and Travill, 1997 ;Erritzoe
et al., 2011 ;Kish et al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2010 ;McCann
et al., 2008 ;Thompson et al., 2004 ). These effects of MDMA
are suggested to be attributed to the alteration in monoami-nergic systems, especially changes involving serotonin (5-HT),
5-HT receptors, and SERT ( Battaglia et al., 1988 ;Han and Gu,
2006 ;Schmidt et al., 1987 ). The usage of MDMA could cause
acute symptoms such as weight loss and elevation in levels ofthe stress hormone corticosterone, due to the suppression of
appetite and the activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis ( Francis et al., 2011 ;Nash et al., 1988 ).
SERT is a member of the sodium/neurotransmitter
symporter family that transports 5-HT from the synapse
to the presynaptic neuron. This protein is also themain target of many antidepressant medications, incl-uding selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) andserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( Immadisetty
et al., 2013 ). The involvement of SERT in the mechanism of
MDMA-induced neurotoxicity has been well demonstrated
(Li et al., 2010 ;Renoir et al., 2008 ;Sanchez et al., 2001 ;
Schmidt and Taylor , 1990 ;Shankaran et al., 1999 ). MDMA
can bind to SERT and enter 5-HT nerve terminal via thetransporter that facilitate pre-synaptic release of 5-HTfrom the storage vesicles ( Partilla et al., 2006 ). This acute
increase in 5-HT levels in the nerve terminal triggers a
rapid accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of5-HT metabolism by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), whichis converted into hydroxyl radical to induce oxidativestress in mitochondria of serotonergic neurons ( Alves
et al., 2007 ). Oxidative damage to the mitochondria can
initiate the intracellular cascade leading to neurotoxicity.One potential therapeutic mechanism by which a SSRI
inhibits MDMA-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity is pre-
venting the entry of MDMA and its free radical-generatingreactive metabolites into serotonergic nerve terminals
(Capela et al., 2009 ).
Positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with
11C-labeled radioligands that bind to SERT has been used to
detect serotonergic neurotoxicity induced by MDMA in vivo
(Buchert et al., 2007 ;Cumming et al., 2007 ;McCann
et al., 2005 ;Urban et al., 2012 ). In addition to
11C-labeled radioligands (e.g. [11C]-(+) McN5652 and
[11C]-DASB), our group has recently developed a
18F-labeled ligand, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4 -[18F]ﬂuoro-
phenylthio)benzylamine (4-[18F]-ADAM), which has speci ﬁc
binding to SERT and has longer half-lives than11C-labeled
ligands. 4-[18F]-ADAM has been used to visualize SERT in
living brain of rats, monkeys, and humans ( Chen
et al., 2012 ;Huang et al., 2013 ;Ma et al., 2009 ;Yeh
et al., 2015 ). Our group has also demonstrated that, in the
use of small-animal PET and 4-[18F]-ADAM, a single dose of
ﬂuoxetine (a SSRI) provides long-lasting protection against
MDMA-induced loss of SERT of the rat brain ( Li et al., 2010 ).
Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene; RSV) is a
natural polyphenolic phytoalexin which is well known forits antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-in ﬂammatory, anti-
aging, and anti-angiogenic properties ( Li et al., 2014 ;Lin
et al., 2014 ). It has been shown that RSV has an ex-vivo
inhibitory effect on the uptake of [
3H]5-Hydroxytryptamine
([3H]-5-HT) by synaptosomes from rat brain ( Yanez
et al., 2006 ), suggesting a probable binding af ﬁnity between
RSV and SERT . However , it is still unknown whether RSV canexert neuroprotection against MDMA, possibly via blocking
the entry of MDMA into 5-HT neuronal terminals.
In light of these ﬁndings, we hypothesized that RSV may
have the potential to protect against MDMA-induced neuro-toxicity, possibly through competing binding sites of SERT
with MDMA. To test this, binding relationship between RSV
and SERT was ﬁrst evaluated by measuring SERT occupancy
by RSV using the PET scans. We then tested whether the RSV
treatment is effective against MDMA-induced acute changes
in body weight and plasma corticosterone levels as well aslong-term changes in cerebral SERT availability and
depressive-like behaviors from the rats.93 Evaluation of brain SERT occupancy by resveratrol against MDMA-induced neurobiological and behavioral changes2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Reagents
MDMA (purity, 98%) was obtained from the Investigation
Bureau of Taiwan. RSV and (2-hydroxypropyl)- β-cyclodextrin
(average Mw /C241460) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Corticosterone was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and corticosterone-d8 asinternal standard was obtained from Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, Inc. (Andover , MA, USA). HPLC grade acetoni-
trile and methanol were obtained from Tedia Company, Inc.(Fairﬁeld, OH, USA) and Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany),
respectively. HPLC grade glacial acetic acid was from JT
Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). All the other chemicals were
of analytical grade and commercially available. Water wasprepared using a Milli-Q water puri ﬁcation system
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
2.2. Animals
Eight-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (250 –300 g,
BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) were housed
two per cage in a 12-h light/dark temperature-controlledenvironment with free access to water and food. They were
allowed to acclimatize to the environment for 5 days beforeany experiment. All experimental procedures were in
compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the National Defense Medical Center , Taipei,Taiwan, R.O.C.
2.3. Radiopharmaceuticals and small-animal PET
imaging
Small-animal PET imaging was conducted at the National
Defense Medical Center Laboratory Animal Center. Theradioligand 4-[
18F]-ADAM (purity, 495%) was synthesized
in an automated synthesis module ( Peng et al., 2008 ) and
obtained from Department of Nuclear Medicine at Tri-Service General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). The rats wereﬁrst anesthetized by passive inhalation of a mixture of
isoﬂurane/oxygen (5% iso ﬂurane for induction, and 2% for
maintenance). After deep anesthesia was con ﬁrmed, 4-
[
18F]-ADAM (18.5 –22.2 MBq; 0.5 –0.6 mCi) was injected into
the animal via the tail vein. 60 min after 4-[18F]-ADAM
injection, the PET images were acquired by BIOPET 105imager (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, DC, USA) for 30 min,
with the energy window set at 250 –700 keV . Image
Figure 1 (A) Design of SERT occupancy using 4-[18F]-ADAM PET imaging to evaluate test drugs including RSV and MDMA. (B) The
protocol for Experiment 2. Rats received subcutaneous injections of SAL or MDMA and intraperitoneal injections of DMSO or RSV
twice daily on days 0, 1, 2, and 3. Sucrose preference was evaluated on days -1 (baseline), 8, 15, and 22. PET imaging with wasperformed on day 18. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured on days 3, 12, and 19. Forced swim tests were evaluated on days20 (pretest) and 21.J.-H. Shih et al. 94acquisition procedure was similar to those of the previous
reports ( Li et al., 2010 ;Ma et al., 2009 ). Three-dimensional
ordered subsets expectation maximization was employed to
reconstruct the images. Imaging data were analyzed byopen-source AMIDE software version 1.0.4. A volume ofinterest (VOI) was de ﬁned for each brain region that was
of particular interest. These brain regions include midbrain,
amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, and frontalcortex. To minimize inconsistencies in VOI placement among
the animals, the MR image was obtained from a typical SD
rat brain and fused manually with 6 reconstructed 4-[
18F]-
ADAM PET images of normal SD rats to draw VOIs according
to a rat brain atlas. These VOIs and the typical MR image
were saved as a template for further analysis. The 4-[18F]-
ADAM image of each individual animal was co-registered
manually to the MR template image with VOIs using AMIDE
software for measuring the activities in a number of brainregions. As SERT availability in a speci ﬁc brain region
correlates to 4-[
18F]-ADAM uptake in a VOI, the speci ﬁc
uptake ratio (SUR) of 4-[18F]-ADAM in each brain region was
analyzed as: (region VOI uptake-cerebellum VOI uptake) /cerebellum VOI uptake ( Ma et al., 2009 ). The cerebellum
was chosen as the reference tissue for its negligible SERT
density ( Lin et al., 2004 ) that generates individual-speci ﬁc
background 4-[
18F]-ADAM uptakes.
2.4. Experiment 1: SERT occupancy by RSV or
MDMA measured using 4-[18F]-ADAM PET
Experiment 1 was conducted, using 4-[18F]-ADAM PET ima-
ging, to measure SERT occupancy [O (%)] by RSV and MDMA,as a method to gauge in-vivo SERT binding of RSV and MDMA.
The experimental design is schematically shown in
Figure 1 A. Baseline 4-[
18F]-ADAM PET scans were done when
the animals were free from any drug treatment. 1 weekafter the baseline scans, we performed post-drug scans,
which were initiated 10 minutes after the drug injection.
Eighteen rats were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groupsthat were injected intravenously (i.v.) with either vehicle
(20% (2-hydroxypropyl)- β-cyclodextrin, average Mw /C241460)
(Marier et al., 2002 ) or RSV (10, 20, 40, 80 mg/kg), or
subcutaneously (s.c.) with MDMA (10 mg/kg). SERToccupancy represents the reduction of 4-[
18F]-ADAM binding
from the baseline when the animal was under a given dose
of vehicle, RSV or MDMA and was calculated using the
formula: O (%) =100/C2(SUR baseline –SUR post-drug ) / SUR baseline .
This equation was modi ﬁed from: O (%) =100/C2(BP baseline –
BPpost-drug )/B P baseline , where BP is the binding potential of
the transporter and its ligand ( Passchier et al., 2002 ). This
transformation is in accordance with the simpli ﬁed refer-
ence tissue model ( Zhang and Fox, 2012 ).
Occupancy values by different RSV doses were plotted
and the dose-response curves were generated in a region-speci ﬁc manner (Supplemental Figure 1 ). ED
50(drug dose
for 50% of maximum occupancy of SERT) values of RSV in the
selected regions were generated based upon the sigmoidalEmax model. The ED
50in the midbrain and the amygdala
cannot be generated because these two dose-response
curves did not ﬁt the sigmoidal Emax function. Average
occupancy by a given dose of the test drug was the averageof the regional occupancy values weighted by the size of the
VOI.
2.5. Experiment 2: Acute and long-term effects of
MDMA in the presence of RSV
MDMA was dissolved in saline (SAL, 0.9% NaCl) for subcuta-
neous injection. RSV was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for intraperitoneal injection. T wenty four rats were
randomly assigned to 4 groups. The SAL/DMSO groupreceived 1 mL/kg of SAL (s.c.) and 1 mL/kg DMSO (i.p.)
vehicles and served as a control; the MDMA/DMSO group
received MDMA (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and DMSO (1 mL/kg, i.p.);the MDMA/RSV group received MDMA (10 mg/kg, s.c.) andRSV (20 mg/kg, i.p.); and the SAL/RSV group received saline
(1 mL/kg, s.c.) and RSV (20 mg/kg, i.p.). All drugs were
administered twice daily for 4 consecutive days. Thisadministration schedule for MDMA has been shown in the
previous experiments to produce persistent alterations in
serotonergic function ( Li et al., 2010 ), and the dose of RSV
used in this study both based on the similar ED
50values in
three regions including thalamus, striatum and frontal
cortex in Experiment 1 (Supplemental Figure 1 ) and fol-
lowed the study described previously for serotonergic

The schedule for Experiment 2 is shown in Figure 1 B. Body
weight and plasma corticosterone levels were measured to
assess the acute effects of MDMA. In order to con ﬁrm
changes in body weight that were not in ﬂuenced by
anhedonia, the sucrose preference test was also monitored.
To evaluate the long-term effects of MDMA, SERT imaging
and performance in the forced swim test were measured2 weeks after drug treatment. Because the half-life of RSV
(t
1/2, 0.1 –2.0 h) and MDMA ( t1/2, 0.9 –2.0 h) is much shorter
than 24 h in the rats ( Concheiro et al., 2014 ;Liang et al.,
2013 ;Marier et al., 2002 ), we would not expect residual RSV
or MDMA, if there was any, could bind competitively against
4-[18F]-ADAM at SERT binding sites 2 weeks after the
treatment. Therefore, the SUR of 4-[18F]-ADAM in the brain
regions can be regarded as a surrogate indicator of the SERT
availability.
2.6. Blood sampling procedures
Blood samples were collected from the rats in the evening
(6–8 p.m.) on days 3 (one hour after the last treatment),
12 and 19 for analyzing plasma corticosterone levels
(Figure 1 B). The animals were moved to the testing room1 h before blood sampling to prevent arousal effects from a
changed environment and then anesthetized with passiveinhalation of a mixture of iso ﬂurane/oxygen to reduce
stress. 200 μL blood of each rat was collected via the tail
vein into 1-mL insulin syringes, transferred to 1.5-mL plastictubes on ice, and spun for 5 min at 13000 rpm; plasma was
decanted and stored at /C0801C until assay.
2.7. Plasma corticosterone quanti ﬁed using UPLC-
tandem mass
All rat plasma samples were thawed at room temperature
before analysis. 200 μL of acetonitrile was added to 50- μL
aliquot of plasma and mixed thoroughly for 3 min todeproteinate the plasma. 10 μL of internal standard solution
was added in each sample. After 30 s of vortex mixing, all
the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at
41C. The supernatants were evaporated to dryness under a
nitrogen stream and reconstituted with 100 μL 50% metha-
nol. The reconstituted solutions were transferred to the
autosampler vials, and 10 μL were injected into an ultrahigh
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass
system. A Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA)

USA) triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for
plasma corticosterone analysis. The ionization was con-
ducted using an electrospray ionization interface in positivemode, and analytes were quanti ﬁed using multiple reaction
monitoring mode. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored
were m/z 355.4-337.4 for corticosterone-d8 and 347.3 -
329.3 for corticosterone. The dwell time of each ion was setat 300 ms. Ion source temperature was maintained at
450 1C, and ion spray voltage was 5500 V . High purity
nitrogen gas was used as the collision-induced dissociationgas (12 psi), curtain gas (13 psi), and nebulizer gas (10 psi).
Chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm length /C22.1 mm inner
diameter; 1.7 μm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA)
maintained at 35 1C. A gradient elution scheme was
employed using 2 mobile phases: A (0.1% acetic acid inwater) and B (0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile). The ﬂow rate
was set at 0.3 mL/min. In the gradient program the pump
was ramped from 10% phase B to 90% phase B in 3.5 min, and
then back to 10% phase B in 0.5 minutes, where it remainedfor 2 min. Data processing was performed using Analyst
1.4.1 software package.
2.8. Sucrose preference test
The sucrose preference test was employed as a measure of
anhedonia. Rats were habituated to drinking a 2% sucrosesolution by replacing normal water with sucrose solution for
48 h, during which they had free access to food. On the
following day, baseline sucrose preference was measured. Inthis procedure, all rats were deprived of food and water for
14 h, starting at the beginning of the dark phase of the
light/dark cycle. After the 14-h deprivation period, ratswere given free access for one hour to two drinking bottles,
containing either water or 2% sucrose, placed side-by-side
at the rear of the cage. Sucrose preference was calculatedusing the following formula: sucrose preference =sucrose
solution intake (g) / total ﬂuid intake (g).
2.9. Forced swim test
The forced swim test employed was similar to the paradigm
described previously ( Porsolt et al., 1978 ). Brie ﬂy, rats were
exposed to a 15-min pretest 24 h prior to the 6-min swim
test. The pretest facilitates the development of immobility
during the test session and increases the sensitivity fordetecting antidepressant behavioral effects. Rats were
placed into a glass cylinder (height: 46 cm; diameter:
20 cm) ﬁlled to a depth of 30 cm with water at room
temperature. A rat was judged to be immobile when itceased struggling and remained ﬂoating motionless in the
water , making only small movements necessary to keep its
head above the water. The duration of observed immobilitywas videotaped for scoring later during the last 4 min of the
testing period. Following the swimming session, the rats
were removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels,placed in heated cages for 15 min, and then returned to
their home cages.2.10. Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as the mean 7standard error of the
mean (SEM). Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-
Wilk test. Group differences in the sucrose preference test
were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Spearman's rankcorrelations were used to determine the degree of association
between regional SERT availabilities and behaviors in the forced
swim test (e.g., immobility, swimming and climbing). Otherdata were analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or two-way repeated measures ANOVA,
followed by post hoc Bonferroni test honestly signi ﬁcant
difference in cases with homogeneity of variance and the
Games-Howell test in cases without assuming homoscedasticity.

3. Results
3.1. RSV binding to SERT assessed using small-
animal PET with 4-[18F]-ADAM
T h eg o a lo ft h e ﬁrst experiment was to evaluate binding
between SERT and RSV . We performed PET imaging with 4-
[18F]-ADAM to measure SERT occupancy by RSV , which can be
used to gauge in-vivo binding between RSV and SERT (see
experimental procedures 2.4). Regional and average occupancy
by RSV (with 4 different doses) reveal a dose-dependent
relationship ( Table 1 ). The SERT occupancy values of RSV at
different doses were found in the midbrain (5.4 –40.5%),
striatum (1.4 –35.4%), thalamus (-5.4 –31.8%), hypothalamus
(4.1 –28.9%), amygdala (3.1 –23.5%), frontal cortex (6.6 –19.2%),
and the weighted average of all regions examined for different
doses were from 3.4 to 29.4%. Examples of the distribution of 4-
[18F]-ADAM binding in the rat midbrain after different doses of
RSV are shown in Figure 2 A. ED 50of RSV in the thalamus,
hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex range from 19.7 to
34.8 mg/kg (Supplemental Figure 1 ) ,w h i c hg i v ea na v e r a g e

the brain regions may re ﬂect variability in serotonin innervation
of the brain. Occupancy patterns induced by chemicals with
minute BP (vehicle) and strong BP (MDMA) to SERT can be seenas the references for RSV binding. Our data showed that MDMA
at 10 mg/kg, s.c. was capable of occupying an average of 83.2%
of available SERT of the rat ’s brain. In contrast, even at 80 mg/

3.2. RSV ameliorates weight loss induced by MDMA
during post-treatment
The effects of MDMA and RSV on body weight are shown in
Figure 3 A. During drug treatment, two-way repeated measures
ANOVA revealed a signi ﬁcant main effect of drug treatment
(F(3, 15) =3.852, p=0.032) and drug by day interaction
(F(3, 15)=6.528, p=0.005), but no signi ﬁcant effect of day
(F(1, 5)=1.438, p=0.284). Since drug by day interaction was
signiﬁcant, the simple main effect on day 4 was further
analyzed by a one-way ANOVA to compare the difference of
body weight among the 4 groups. This indicated a signi ﬁcant97 Evaluation of brain SERT occupancy by resveratrol against MDMA-induced neurobiological and behavioral changesdifference between the means of the 4 groups on day 4 ( F(3,
20)=14.134, po0.001). The post hoc comparisons revealed a
signiﬁcant decrease in body weight for rats in the MDMA/DMSO
group relative to SAL/DMSO rats ( po0.001). After treatment
withdrawal, two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed asigniﬁcant overall effect of drug treatment ( F

po0.001) and day ( F(2, 10)=319.353, po0.001), but no sig-
niﬁcant drug by day interaction ( F(6, 30)=2.276, p=0.063). If we
further analyzed weight gain from days 11 to 25 betweengroups ( Figure 3 B), one-way ANOVA indicated a signi ﬁcant
difference between the means of the 4 groups ( F
(3, 20) =
4.697, p=0.012). Bonferroni post hoc comparisons revealed a
signiﬁcant increase in body weight for MDMA/RSV rats relative
to SAL/DMSO rats ( po0.05) and a borderline signi ﬁcance for
MDMA/RSV rats relative to MDMA/DMSO rats ( p=0.059). There
were no statistical differences among MDMA/DMSO, SAL/RSV ,
and SAL/DMSO rats.
Because anhedonia involving brain dopamine has been
postulated to play a critical role in incentive motivation
associated with food and water ( Wise, 2008 ), we evaluated
the sucrose preference test (Supplemental Figure 2 ). From
baseline to day 22, the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that nodifference between groups was identi ﬁed.
3.3. RSV inhibits MDMA-induced elevation of
plasma corticosterone levels
To evaluate both acute and with drawal effects of RSV on MDMA-
induced activation of the HPA axis, plasma corticosterone levelswere measured on days 3, 12 and 19 ( Figure 1 B). One-way
ANOVA indicated a signi ﬁcant difference between the means ofthe 4 groups on day 3 ( F
(3, 20)=3.718, p=0.028) ( Figure 3 C).
Bonferroni post hoc comparisons revealed a signi ﬁcant increase

3.4. RSV reduces immobility and increases
swimming in MDMA-treated rats
We carried out the forced swim test to explore the effect of
RSV on MDMA-evoked long-term depressive behaviors(Figure 3 D). There were signi ﬁcant overall group effects
for immobility ( F(
3, 20)=10.936, po0.001) and swimming ( F
(3, 20)=10.993, po0.001), but not climbing ( F(3, 20)=1.385,
p=0.276). Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed that rats in
the MDMA/DMSO group displayed greater immobility and
less swimming than those in the SAL/DMSO and SAL/RSV
groups ( po0.001). Although MDMA/RSV rats showed greater
immobility and less swimming than SAL/DMSO or SAL/RSV
rats, there were no statistically signi ﬁcant differences. No
differences in climbing time were observed betweengroups.
3.5. RSV protects rats against MDMA-induced loss
of SERT and depressive-like behaviors
Previous studies demonstrated that MDMA could produce
long-lasting changes in the density of SERT ( Li et al., 2010 ).
Figure 3 Effects of RSV on body weight, plasma corticosterone levels and forced swim tests. (A) During the 4 days of treatment,
RSV had a neutral effect on body weight, and MDMA signi ﬁcantly inhibited weight gain. (B) Body weight of MDMA/RSV rats increased
signiﬁcantly compared to SAL/DMSO rats during the post-treatment period. (C) RSV inhibits MDMA-induced elevation of plasma

treatment), 12 and 19. (D) RSV reduces immobility and increases swimming in MDMA-treated rats in forced swim tests. Forced swim

potential drug that helps to protect against MDMA-inducedSERT loss, which can be revealed using small-animal PET
with 4-[
18F]-ADAM. The PET images of MDMA/DMSO treated
rats showed signi ﬁcantly reduced 4-[18F]-ADAM uptakes in
all the brain regions examined (except the striatum at
borderline signi ﬁcance) compared to the SAL/DMSO group
(Figure 4 ). The extent of 4-[18F]-ADAM uptake in the SAL/
RSV group was similar to that in the SAL/DMSO group. In theMDMA/RSV group, the uptake of 4-[18F]-ADAM in the regions
examined was moderately higher than that in the MDMA/DMSO group ( Figure 4 A). The SUR values of 4-[
18F]-ADAM in
the rat brain were further calculated for quanti ﬁcation
(Figure 4 B). In the MDMA/DMSO group, the average SUR
values for SERT in the brain regions examined were sig-
niﬁcantly reduced, by 40 –69%, relative to those in the SAL/
DMSO group. In addition, the SUR values of the MDMA/RSVgroup were markedly higher (approximately 37 –52% higher)

Spearman's rank correlations were evaluated to determine
the degree of relationship between regional SERT availabilities,
immobility times, swimming times, and climbing times
(Table 2 ). Immobility time was highly negatively related to
SERT availabilities in midbrai n, hypothalamus, and thalamus
(ρ=/C00.75/C24/C00.87, po0.001). Swimming time was moder-
ately positively related to SERT availabilities in midbrain,
hypothalamus, thalamus, am ygdala and frontal cortex
(ρ=0.52 –0.73, po0.01). However , no signi ﬁcant correlation
was uncovered between climbing time and SERT availability inany region. The correlations for SERT availabilities between the
brain regions examined were moderate to high ( ρ=0.60 –0.87,
po0.01). Scatter plots of SUR of brain regions examined
plotted against immobility times ( Figure 5 ).
4. Discussion
Using small-animal PET with 4-[18F]-ADAM, SERT was found
to be a potential biological target of RSV with directinteraction, indicating a possible role of RSV in interfering
uptake of MDMA into serotonergic nerve terminals and inreducing MDMA neurotoxicity. In this study, we found that
RSV ameliorated MDMA-induced neurobiological and beha-
vioral effects including HPA axis activation, reductions inSERT availability, and depressive-like behaviors.
Previous ex-vivo studies have demonstrated the inhibitory
effects of MDMA and RSV on [
3H]5-HT uptake by synaptosomes
from rat brain. IC 50values for the inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake
by MDMA and RSV in synaptosomes are 0.4 –1.7μMa n d3 2 . 5 –
51.6 μM, respectively, indicating that MDMA is at least 19-fold
more potent than RSV ( Johnson et al., 1991 ;Steele et al.,
1987 ;Yanez et al., 2006 ). However , the ex-vivo uptake process
of [3H]5-HT by synaptosomes fails to distinguish between SERT
transporting and diffusion. In the present study, by contrast,we were able to collect in-vivo data of SERT occupancy of the
brain, which was subsequently used to calculate SERT binding
potency under different pharmacological scenarios. In addi-tion, our data indicated that t he average potency of MDMA (at
10 mg/kg s.c.) is 24-fold great er than that of RSV (at 10 mg/kg
i.v.) ( Table 1 )a n dt h i si sa tl a r g ei na g r e e m e n tw i t ht h e
previous ex-vivo results.
Figure 5 Scatter plots of SUR values of brain regions examined plotted against immobility times. Spearman's rank correlations were
used to determine the degree of association between regional SERT availability in experiment 2 and immobility time in the forced
swim test. ρrepresents the Spearman correlation coef ﬁcient.J.-H. Shih et al. 100The low binding potency of RSV may be explained by the
fact that the concentrations of RSV and its metabolites are
lower in the rat brain due to rapid ﬁrst-pass metabolism, in
which 40% of the parent compound is metabolized toglucuronide and sulfate conjugates in the ﬁrst minute after
intravenous administration and only 12% of the parent
compound is detectable 20 minutes later ( Juan et al.,
2010 ;Wenzel and Somoza, 2005 ). Moreover , 87% of intra-
venous RSV is rapidly eliminated via the kidney after
metabolism by the glucuronidation pathway ( Marier et al.,
2002 ), and glucuronide conjugates may also be too polar to
traverse the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the brain
concentration of MDMA after subcutaneous administration
at 20 mg/kg is far higher than that for RSV after intravenousdosing at 20 mg/kg (43.7 nmol/g versus o0.1 nmol/g,
respectively) ( Chu et al., 1996 ;Lou et al., 2014 ), which
favors the binding of MDMA to SERT .
As SERT occupancy is partially generated by calculating
the reduction in 4-[
18F]-ADAM binding from the baseline
after the test drug was given, the values of SERT occupancy
by the test drug are in general positive values. In the vehiclegroup, however , we observed several negative values for
SERT occupancy, which indicated an increase instead of a
decrease in SERT availability after the vehicle was given tothe animals ( Table 1 ). This phenomenon may be due to a
steady increase in SERT availability from puberty until
adulthood (Supplemental Figure 3 ), as described in the
previous studies ( Moll et al., 2000 ;Ulloa et al., 2014 ).
Additionally, SERT occupancy by RSV and MDMA in this study
(Table 1 ) revealed that the greatest SERT occupancy values
were found in the midbrain at 80 mg/kg RSV and 10 mg/kgMDMA. This observation may be due to that SERT availability
in the midbrain is the highest among the brain regions
examined in accord with the previous studies ( Park
et al., 2014 ;Parsey et al., 2000 ).
Owing to the partial SERT occupancy by RSV , it is of great
interest how RSV affords protection against the acute andlong-term adverse effects of MDMA. We found that RSV had a
neutral effect on body weight during treatment ( Figure 3 A),
which is in agreement with the previous studies ( Juan et al.,
2002 ;Turner et al., 1999 ). However , RSV treatment signi ﬁ-
cantly facilitated weight gain of MDMA/RSV rats during the
14-day post-treatment period ( Figure 3 B). This effect is
particular interesting while the underlying mechanism is stillunclear . One possible explanation is that the partial occu-
pancy of SERT by RSV during treatment may prevent the
MDMA-induced long-lasting reduction in SERT expression. Inaddition, RSV may help to prevent MDMA-induced damage on
serotonergic neurons. SERT proteins have been shown to be
appropriate markers for the integrity and density of seroto-nergic innervation ( Li et al., 2010 ;Nielsen et al., 2006 ). The
higher SERT availability found in MDMA/RSV rats compared to
MDMA/DMSO rats in the midbrain and the thalamus mayindicate a better serotonergic innervation ( Figure 4 ).
Besides, higher serotonergic innervation in the frontal cortex
has been associated with higher body weights from infancy to
adulthood ( Himpel et al., 2006 ). However , our data showed
that RSV afforded negligible protection against MDMA-
induced loss of SERT in the frontal cortex ( Figure 4 B).
MDMA has been well demonstrated to induce an immediate
e l e v a t i o ni np l a s m ac o r t i c o s t e r o n eo rc o r t i s o ll e v e l( Downey
et al., 2015 ;Johnson and Yamamoto, 2010 ;P a r r o t te ta l . ,2013 ;Parrott et al., 2014 ), likely resulting from the release of
5-HT and activation of 5-HT
2receptor on hypothalamic
neurons that regulate pituitary-adrenocortical function
(Fuller , 1981 ;Holmes et al., 1982 ;Koenig et al., 1987 ). The
current data con ﬁrmed these previous ﬁndings ( Figure 3 C),
although this MDMA-induced effect was ceased upon drug
withdrawn. Also, we found that RSV appeared to inhibit MDMA-
induced elevation in the corticosterone level, although thisinhibitory effect was not statistically signi ﬁcant ( Figure 3 C).
Even though RSV has been reported to suppress corticosterone
production in primary rat adrenocortical cell cultures(Supornsilchai et al., 2005 ), our results revealed no differ-
ences in plasma corticosterone levels between SAL/DMSO and
SAL/RSV rats.
The forced swim test is one of the most commonly used
behavioral animal models for assessing antidepressant-like
activity of drugs. It is well accepted that increased time ofswimming behavior in rats relates to an elevation of brain 5-HT levels, whereas an increase in climbing behavior indi-
cates an upregulated release of norepinephrine or dopamine
(Bogdanova et al., 2013 ;Javelot et al., 2014 ;Vieira
et al., 2008 ). Our results that MDMA-treated rats displayed
signiﬁcantly less swimming and greater immobility is in
agreement with previous studies ( Thompson et al., 2004 ),
suggesting that this dosage regimen of MDMA leads to long-
term depressive-like symptoms in this experimental setting.
Interestingly, no signi ﬁcant difference between groups in
the climbing time was observed, implying that catechola-
minergic neurons may not be in ﬂuenced by MDMA in the
present study. We demonstrated that RSV treatment sig-niﬁcantly reduced immobility and increased swimming in
the MDMA-treated rats. These results are consistent with
previous researches reporting anti-depressive effects of RSV
(Ali et al., 2015 ;Ge et al., 2013 ;Pang et al., 2015 ;Wang
et al., 2013 ;Xu et al., 2010 ;Yu et al., 2013 ). Moreover , we
found that immobility time was negatively associated with
SERT availabilities in the brain regions examined of the rats(Figure 5 ). Taken together , these ﬁndings provide evidence
that co-treatment of RSV in the MDMA administration could
prevent a long-term decrease in SERT availabilities inmultiple brain regions of the rats that potentially helps toameliorate the MDMA-induced depressive-like behaviors in
the forced swim test.
In conclusion, using small-animal PET with 4-[
18F]-ADAM,
a novel and potentially important ﬁnding was that SERT is a
biological target of RSV . In addition, that SERT availabilities
in several key regions of the rat brain were negativelycorrelated with immobility time in the forced swim test
implies that low cerebral SERT availability is strongly
associated with depressive behaviors. These ﬁndings high-
light a therapeutic potential of RSV for depression and
anxiety disorders, as well as a neuroprotective potential for
recreationally abused substances including MDMA, cocaineand methamphetamine.
