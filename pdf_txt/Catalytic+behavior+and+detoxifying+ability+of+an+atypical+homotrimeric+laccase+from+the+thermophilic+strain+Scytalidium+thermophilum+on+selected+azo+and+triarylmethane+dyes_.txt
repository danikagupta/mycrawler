Abstract  
Laccase  from Trametes  versicolor  was immobilized by 
covalent bonds formation on CPC silica carriers . Elimination 
of two floroqinolone (FQ) ; enrofloxacine (ENR) and 
flumequine (FLU)  using laccase in both free and 
immobilized form in the absence and presence of  
1-hydroxybenzotri azole (HBT)  and 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid 
(HBA)  as mediators  was investigated. Temperature,  pH and 
storage  stability of  immobilized laccase  was significantly 
improved compare to free laccase.  In the absence of a 
laccase mediator, the initial  concentrations of 50 mg L−1 of 
ENR and FLU  decreased by 19 %  and 28 %, respectively,  
after 6 h treatment using the immobilized  laccase , while, 
the removal percentages  were  increased to  98 % and 96 %, 
respectively,  when the immobilized  laccase was used  in presence of HBT . Whereas  the removal percentages of ENR 
and FLU were increased to  97 % and 88 %,  respectively, 
when the immobilized  laccase was used  in presence of 
HBA. A fter twenty  runs of the enzymatic  elimination 
(laccase -HBT system)  of ENR and FLU, the immobilized 
laccase exhibited the relative removal of  17.63 %  and 15.62 
%, respectively . The results of microtoxicity  test ( growth 
inhabitation percentage of six bacteria l strains) showed a 
significant decrease in toxicity of the laccase -treated ENR 
and FLU  solution.  
Keywords:  Enrofloxacine , flumequine , immobilized 
enzyme, laccase,  antibiotic removal.  
1. Introduction  
In recent years,  environmental pollution by organic 
compounds  has become a serious problem  due to their 
adverse effects on many forms of l ife (Lopes and Furlong, 
2001; Ashrafi  et al. , 2016; Ashrafi  et al. , 2016) . A group  of 
these compounds that has been widely used in the world is 
pharmaceuticals and personal care products  (PPCPs) . 
Among all the PPCPs, antibiotics occupy an important place 
due to their high consumption rates in both human and 
veterinary medicine  (Nazari  et al. , 2016; Kamani  et al. , 
2017; Panahi  et al. , 2019) . Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are 
among the most important classes of synthetic antibiotic 
used widely in ve terinary and human medicine for 
therapeutic purposes and as a growth promoter (Fink  
et al. , 2012) . Among the FQs, enrofloxacin and flumequine 
are two important antibacterial agents extensively applied 
in veterinary medicine (Rodrigues -Silva  et al. , 2013) . 
Due to low cost and broad spectrum activity of FLU against 
gram -negative bacteria and its efficacy for many microbial 
infections including respiratory, urinary, and digestive  
system  (Williams  et al. , 2007) , it has been widely used in 
APPLICATION OF FREE AND IMMOBILIZED LACCASE FOR REMOVAL AND DETOXIFICATION OF FLUOROQUINOLONES   241 
aquaculture to cure an d prevent skin infections in fish (Ma 
et al. , 2012) , and in animal husbandry as prophylactics to 
prevent diseases, or as chemotherapeutic agents to control 
diseases (Rodrigues -Silva  et al. , 2013) . ENR is largely used 
in poultry production (Ötker and Akmehm et-Balcıoğlu, 
2005) , cattle and swine farms (Sturini  et al. , 2010) , and 
treat ing respiratory and enteric bacterial infections. Due to 
the low bioavailability  of FQs, it is mainly excreted as 
unchanged compounds in urine and feces, therefore , 
discharged int o environment (Jia et al. , 2012) . In addition , 
they can not be completely removed by conventional 
wastewater treatment systems, therefore, residues of 
these compounds often appear in the environment 
(Wammer  et al. , 2013) . Subsequently, it can increase the 
risk for development of resistant bacteria and affect 
organisms (Ostadhadi -Dehkordi  et al. , 2012; Rodrigues -
Silva  et al. , 2013) , that may increase the risk of cancer 
development.  The removal of ENR and FLU by process es 
such as  Fenton and photo -Fenton (Rodrigues -Silva  et al. , 
2013) , photoca talyzed -doped TiO 2 and UV (Nieto  et al. , 
2008) , adsorption (Ötker and Akmehmet -Balcıoğlu, 2005; 
Yan et al. , 2013; Ashrafi  et al. , 2016)  and oxidation by 
chlorine dioxide  (Wang  et al. , 2010) techniques has been 
investigated in many studies. Recent studies have 
confirmed the ability of enzymes to eliminate the  PPCPs 
(Ostadhadi -Dehkordi  et al. , 2012; Suda  et al. , 2012; Ashrafi  
et al. , 2015) , and organic pollutants (Gholami -Borujeni  et 
al., 2011; Gholami -Borujeni  et al. , 2011; Kalaiarasan  et al. , 
2014; Kamani  et al. , 2018; Mehrabian  et al. , 2018)  as an 
interesting technique of degradation from the eco -friendly 
point of view, due to their higher efficiency and less toxicity 
of metabolites (Saratale  et al. , 2011; Ashrafi  et al. , 2013; 
Gholami -Borujeni  et al. , 2016) . 
Laccases (benzendiol: oxygen oxid oreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) 
belongs to the group of multi copper -containing blue 
oxidases that is widespread in nature, produced mainly by 
fungi (especially white -rot basidiomycetes), brood type of 
plants, and bacteria (Balan  et al. , 2012; Ostadhadi -
Dehkordi  et al. , 2012; Mogharabi and Faramarzi, 2014) . 
Laccase  catalyze the oxidation of a wide  range of phenolic 
substrates coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water molecule. However, applications of laccase may limit 
to oxidation of some substrates  with high redox potentials, 
in the presence of redox mediators  (usually a small 
molecule, that acting as an electron shuttle between the 
enzyme and the substrate ) the spectrum of laccase 
substrates can be expanded to various non -phenolic 
substrates such as xenobiotics (Ostadhadi -Dehkordi  et al. , 
2012; Ashrafi  et al. , 2013) . Immobilization of laccase s is 
necessary for stability and reusability, which enables the 
reusing of immobilized laccases and finally reduces the 
overall cost of enzymatic elimination (Fernández -
Fernández  et al. , 2013; Sadighi and Faramarzi, 2013) . 
In that respect, enzymes have been immobilized on several 
supports by different mechanisms (Fernández -Fernández  
et al. , 2013) , which a mong them,  covalent binding supplies 
considerably more stable  enzymes due to increasing the 
rigidity of enzyme structure and reducing protein unfolding 
(Fernández -Fernández  et al. , 2013) , and it was preferred to 
other mechanisms (Jolivalt  et al. , 2000) . Many reports 
describe the improvement of thermal and other 
operational stabilities of immobilized laccase (Champagne 
and Ramsay, 2010; Dehghanifard  et al. , 2013) . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
application of free and immobilized lac case from Trametes 
versicolor  as a biocatalyst onto silica -based for removal of 
ENR and FLU as a model, and evaluation of the effect of 
operational factors in the presence and absence of HBT, 
and HBA . The toxicity of laccase -treated samples was also 
evalua ted using microtoxicity studies.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Materials  
The laccase (EC 1.10.3.2,  activity  > 10 U mg−1) from 
Trametes versicolor , pre -silanized [3 -

1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), 4-Hydroxybenzoic  acid 
(HBA),  2,2'-azino -bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic 
acid) (ABTS), and a glutaraldehyde (50  %) solution were all 
purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (USA). Flumequine, 
enrofloxacin (Table 1), and all other chemicals were  of the

Chemical structure  
  
2.2. Preparation of immobilized laccase  
Prior to the enzyme attachment, pre -silanized silica 
support was modified by suspending 10 mg of it into 1 mL 
of 0.5 –4.5 % glutaraldehyde (vol/vol) solution (pre viously 
degassed under 2.0 bar vacuum pressure for 2 h) under 
stirring for 3 h in 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 4.5.  The produced glutaraldehyde -activated CPC silica beads 
were washed for three  times with citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 
4.5) and distilled water , and  followed by drying in an oven 
at 40 °C for 24 h. The laccase immobilization on modified 
silica beads was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C under stirring, 
using 10 mg of silica, different concentrations of laccase 
242  ASHRAFI  et al.  
stock -solution  (0.25 –2.5 U mL−1) prepared in citrate buffer 
0.1 M, pH 4.5. Then the support was separated and washed 
three  times with 0.1 M of citrate buffer (pH 4.5) and 2 mol  
L−1 NaCL. The immobilized laccase was stored at 4 °C for the 
further use.  All experiments were performed in d uplicate.  
2.3. Activity assay  of free and immobilized laccase  
The laccase activity was assayed using a UV/vis 
spectrophotometer  (UVD 2950, Labomed, Culver City, USA ) 
with ABTS as  a laccase substrate (2 mM) in 0.1 M citrate 
buffer at pH 4.5  (Ashrafi  et al. , 2013 ). For activity assay of 
laccase, 1 mL of free laccasse solution or 10 mg of 
immobilized laccase was added to 1 and 10 ml of the ABTS 
solution at 40 ° C under shaking at 150 rpm, respectively  
(Rahmani  et al. , 2015) . The change in absorbance at  
420 nm (ε420 = 36,000 M−1 cm−1) was monitored after  
10 min and the catalytic activity was calculated. One unit 
(U) of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that 
oxidized 1 µmol of ABTS per minute  (Tavares  et al. , 2013) . 
2.4. Operational stability of free and immobilized laccase  
The effect of temperature on stability of free and 
immobilized laccase were determined  by incubating the 
samples in the range 4 –80 °C, at pH 4.5 in citrate buffer 0.1 
M for 6 h. The effect of pH on free and immobilized laccase 
stability  was determined as the relative activity  by 
incubating the samples under the variety of pH (ranging 
from 3.0 –7.0 in citrate buffer 0.1 M) at 45 °C for 6 h.  
The storage stability experiments were conducted by 
incubating free and immobilized laccase in citra te buffer 
(0.1 M, pH 4.5) at 25 °C for 18 days and remained activity 
was measured . 
2.5. Removal experiments of ENR and FLU  
In order to study on the ability of the laccase in removal of 
ENR and  FLU,  elimination experiments were carried out in 
a batch reactor.  ENR and  FLU stock (500 mg L−1) were  
prepared in citrate –sodium buffer (0.1 M) and appropriate 
dilutions of this stock were used for elimination 
experiments.  Removal studies were performed by adding 6 
U mL−1 of the free or immobilized laccase . The reaction 
solutions (final volume of 3 mL, pH  5 and  4.5 for ENR and 
FLU, respectively ) containing 50 mg L−1 of each FQs were 
incubated at 45  °C and 150 rpm under dark  for 6 h . The 
reaction tube (Eppendorf 15 mL) were removed every 1 h 
and the r eaction was stopped immediately by adding 3 mL 
of HPLC grade methanol, and stored at   ̶ 20 °C for later 
analyze. Prior to determine the remained concentration of 
FQs the samples filtered through 0.45 μm membranes and 
then measured using high -performance li quid 
chromatography (HPLC). Control samples were maintained 
with heat -inactivated laccase (in the case of free laccase) 
and activated beads without laccase (for immobilized 
laccase ). All the experiments had three replications, and 
the mean of them is repor ted for each experiment.  
2.6. Effect of operational parameters on removal of ENR 
and FLU  2.6.1.  Effect of  temperature , pH, laccase activity  and FQs 
initial concentration  
The effect of temperature on enzymatic removal , was 
studied by incubating 50 mg L−1 of ENR and FLU  solution in 
the presence of free or immobilized laccase (6 U mL−1) at 
temperature range of 30 to 55 °C , pH 5 and 4.5, 
respectively . To study the pH effect , after adjusting the 
initial pH of the reaction s olutions of each FQs (final 
concentration of 50 mg L−1) using 0.1 M citrate –sodium 
buffer at values of 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5, the free or 
immobilized laccase (6 U mL−1) was added to the reaction 
mixtures and incubated at 45 °C , 150 rpm for 6 h. In order 
to determine the effect of laccase activity on removal of 
FQs, 1–12 U mL−1 of the free or immobilized laccase was 
added to the reaction mixture (ENR and FLU with final 
concentration of 50 mg L−1 at pH 5 and 4.5, respectively ) 
followed by incubation at 45 ° C, 150 rpm for 6 h . For the 
evaluating of effects of each FQs initial concentration on 
removal percentage, the reaction mixtures (ENR and FLU 
with final concentration of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg L−1 
at pH 5 and 4.5, respectively ) were incubating after ad ding 
free or immobilized laccase (6 U mL−1) at 45 °C, 150 rpm, 
for 6 h.  
2.6.2.  Effect of mediators on removal of FQs  
The effects of HBT (final concentration of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 
and 3 mM ) and HBA (final concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 
6 mM ) on removal of each FQs was studied by incubating 
of 50 mg L−1 of ENR  (pH 5)  and FLU  (pH 4.5)  solution in 
citrate –sodium buffer in presence of free or immobilized 
laccase (6 U mL−1), at 45 °C , 150 rpm  under dark . All The 
experiment had three replications.  
2.7. HPLC and statistical analysis  
The concentrations of FQs were measured using a high -
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC consist s 
of a Knauer LPG pump, an EZ -chrom HPLC system manager 
program with a UV -visible diode array detector (k -2500 ). 
Separ ation was performed using a  column of MZ -
analysentechnik ODS -3 C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm) packed 
with 5 -μm spherical particles. The samples were injected 
manually using an injection valve (SGE Australia). A 
methanol and water (18:82 vol/vol) mixture (pH 3, adju sted 
by acetic acid glacial), for ENR, and a water, methanol and 
acetonitrile (40:30:30 vol/vol) mixture for FLU, were used 
as mobile phase at 30 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. 
The ENR and FLU retention times in HPLC analysis were 9.2 
and 7.8 min,  respectively.  For the purpose of statistical 
analysis, all experiments performed in triplicate and results 
are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The 
statistical significance between mean values was tested by 
the independent sample t -test and one -way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s T3 Post -Hoc test (SPSS 
18.0, SPSS Inc). The significance level was set to 5  %. 
 
2.8. Reusability of the immobilized laccase  
In order to investigate the reusability of the immobilized 
laccase for removal of  ENR and FLU,  elimination 
experiments were carried out using 6 U mL−1 of APPLICATION OF FREE AND IMMOBILIZED LACCASE FOR REMOVAL AND DETOXIFICATION OF FLUOROQUINOLONES   243 
immobilized laccase in presence of HBT (2  mM) at 45 °C, pH 
of 5 and 4.5, respectively. The applied immobilized laccase 
was separated from substrate solution of each FQs (end of 
each c ycle) by filtration and washed three times with 
citrate sodium buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5). It was then 
immediately added again to other fresh substrate solutions 
of ENR or FLU, and after run time the residual  of each FQs 
were analyzed and the relative removal of each FQs were 
calculated. All the reusability experiments were done in 
triplicate and mean of obtained results were reported.  
2.9. Kinetic studies  
First the velocity of enzymatic elimination of each FQ s 
(Initial concentration 5 –150 mg L−1) in absence and 
presence of applied mediators assisted by  free or 
immobilized laccases has been determined. Then , a 
Michaelis –Menten  curve was drawn by plotting the 
obtained velocity (V) against the each FQ concentrations 
(S). Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximal vel ocity) of 
free and immobilized laccases through each FQ were then 
calculated using the Lineweaver –Burk transformation of 
the Michaelis –Menten equation. All kinetic experiments 
were performed in three replications at 45 °C, in aqueous 
solutions buffered wit h citrate sodium at pH 5 and 4.5 for 
ENR and FLU, respectively.  
2.10. Toxicity assay  
A toxicity assay was conducted based on our previous work 
(Ashrafi  et al. , 2013; Rahmani  et al. , 2015) , in order to 
evaluate the toxic effects of both the untreated and treated 
FQs solutions based on the inhibitory growth of six 
bacterial strains, (three gram -positive bacterial strains; 
Staphylococcus epidemidis  ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus 
aureus  ATCC 6538, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and 
three gram -negative bacterial strains ; E. coli  ATCC 25922, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ATCC 9027, and Klebsiella 
pneumonia ATCC 10031). In brief,  each tested bacterial 
strain was firstly cultivated in Mueller –Hinton broth  to 
reach the OD600 of 0.2. Subsequently, the untreated FQs 
solution (differe nt final concentrations for each FQs against 
each bacteria) and the samples obtained from enzymatic 
treatment of each FQs were separately added to the all set 
bacterial broth and incubated at 37 °C. Changes in the 
OD600 of each bacterial strain were then m onitored and 
recorded every 1 h for 12 h. A negative control (cultivated 
bacterial strain in the absence of FQs) was also conducted 
for each experiment. The percentage of growth inhibition 
(GI %) was defined as [(1 – D600S/OD 600C) × 100], where 
OD 600S is the OD 600 of sample and OD 600C is the OD 600 of 
control (Ben Younes  et al. , 2012 ; Rahmani  et al. , 2015 ). All 
experiments we re performed in triplicate.  
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Laccase immobilization  
Glutaraldehyde is a reagent that used for immobilization of 
enzymes by many researchers (Champagne and Ramsay, 
2010; Tavares  et al. , 2013) . Glutaraldehyde concentration 
inﬂuence the immobilization process (Tavares  et al. , 2013) , 
but there are no speciﬁc guidelines. In this work, in order 
to determine an optimum concentration of glutaraldehyde, 
pre-silanized CPC -silica beads were immersed in  
glutaraldehyde  solution in the range from 0.5 to 4.5  % v/v. 
The results reveal that by increasing the concentration of glutaraldehyde up to 3  % the immobilized laccase activity 
increased  (data not showed) , but by further increasing a 
decrease in immobilized laccase activity was observed.  This 
results was in agreement with Tavares et al.  (Tavares  et al. , 
2013) , who reported that when the glutaraldehyde 
concentration increased up to 5  %, the immobilized laccase 
(from Aspergillus ) activity increased, while after further 
increasing  of glutaraldehy de a decrease in activity was 
reported . Therefore, the concentration of 3% v/v of 
glutaraldehyde was selected and used in all experiments o f 
immobilization procedure. In order to determine the 
optimum concentration of laccase for immobilization, it 
was eva luated by immersing 10 mg of silica support in 
different concentrations of laccase solution  (0.25 –2.5 U 
mL−1) prepared in citrate buffer 0.1 M, pH 4.5. The results 
show that by increasing in the amount of initial laccase 
from 0.25 to 1.25 U mL−1, the relat ive activity of 
immobilized laccase decreased  slightly (from 95.3  to 
92.3  %), but the amount of attached laccase per unit of 
support increased significantly (from 1.9 to 9.2 mg laccase 
per g of support). However, when the amount of initial 
laccase was above 1.25 U mL−1, the amount of attached 
laccase per unit of support increased only slightly, while the 
relative activity of immobilized laccase decline sharply. So, 
the concentration of 1.25 U mL−1 for laccase solution was 
selected and used in all experi ments of immobilization.  
3.2. Operational stability of free and immobilized laccase  
Enzyme stability is one of the most important 
characteristics , especially at industrial applications, which 
depends on its tolerance to deactivation over time under 
environmental conditions, generally temperature and pH 
(Sathishkumar  et al. , 2012) . Figure 1(a–c) shows the 
normalized results of the storage, pH, and te mperature 
stabilities of free and immobilized laccase. The proﬁles of 
thermal stability for free and immobilized laccase are 
shown in Figure 1a. At temperature 4 °C after 6 h, the free 
and immobilized laccase exhibited the highest stability and 
there was n o any losses in their activity.  The activity of free 
laccase was decreased to 95.93, 91.05, and 87.7  % at 
temperature 20, 30 and 40 °C after 6 h , respectively . 
Whereas, there was no significant difference compared to 
immobilized laccase. However, at temper ature 80 °C, only 
8.13  % of relative activity of the free laccase was remained 
after 6 h, compared to immobilized laccase (57.37  %). This 
finding was in agreement with Rahmani,  et al.  (Rahmani  et 
al., 2015) , who reported that the free and immobilized 
lacca se on porous silica beads retains 25.6  % and 85.4  % of 
its relative activity at temperature  70 °C for 2 h. A 
description might be that stabilization of active 
conformation is increased by multipoint bond formation 
between the laccase molecule and the suppo rt, which 
improved thermal stability of the immobilized laccase (Zhu  
et al. , 2007) . The similar result was reported by Arica et al.  
(Arıca  et al. , 2009) , who reported the free and immobilized 
laccase on non -porous poly (glycidyl 
methacrylate/ethylene glycol dimethacrylate [poly 
GMA/EGDMA -DAH]) beads retains 45  % and 7% of its 
relative activity after incubation at 65 °C for 2 h, 
respectively.  244  ASHRAFI  et al.  
Figure 1b sho ws the profile of free and immobilized  laccase  
pH stability over the range 3 –7 after 6 h. At pH 3 , free and 
immobilized laccase lost more than 26  % and  45 % of its 
initial activity. However, at pH 7, free laccase loses more 
than 84  % of its initial activit y, but, the immobilized laccase 
retained more than 70  %. The results indicate that the 
resistance of the immobilized laccase to broader range of 
pH was increased compared to free laccase. This result  was 
in agreement with Mirzadeh  et al.  (Mirzadeh  et al. , 2014) , 
who reported that the immobilized laccase of 
Paraconiothyrium variabile  on CPC silica beads, exhibited a 
broader range of relative activity under extremes of pH 
conditions, compared to free laccase. Dodor et al.  (Dodor  
et al. , 2004) , reported that the free laccase from Trametes 
versicolor  retained 3  % of its initial activity at pH 2, but, the 
immobilized laccase on kaolinite retained 40  % of its initial 
activity.  
The pattern of decline in laccase activity during time as 
storage stability was shown i n Figure 1c. During the first 6 
days storage there was not significant decrease (13  %) in 
the initial activity of immobilized laccase; by contrast, in the 
same time the free laccase retained only 46.34  % of its 
initial activity. After 16 days of storage at  25 °C, loss of 
activity of the immobilized laccase was about 63  % whereas 
the free laccase lost all its activity within same time. The 
similar result was reported by Arica et al.  (Arıca  et al. , 
2009) , who reported the free laccase at 4 °C lost all its 
activity within a 6 -week, whereas the immobilized laccase 
on spacer -arm attached non -porous poly(GMA/EGDMA) 
beads lost only 48  % of its initial activity over the same 
period. The study of Annibale et al.  (Annibale  et al. , 1999) , 
showed that laccase from Lentinula edodes  immobilized on 
chitosan maintained 85  % of its initial activity during 2 
months storage at 5  °C, whereas the loss of the free laccase 
was about 65  %.

3.3. Removal of ENR and FLU using free and immobilized 
laccase  
In order to demonstrate the time course of both FQs 
elimination by laccase, removal studies were performed by 
adding the free or immobilized laccase (6 U mL−1) to t he 
reaction solutions (50 mg L−1 of ENR and FLU at pH 5 and 
4.5, respectively), and were incubated for 12 h . As shown 
in Figure 2, both the free and immobilized laccase were  
efficiently able to remove ENR (74  % and 80.66  %) and FLU 
(68.33  % and 72.33  %) after 4 h and 6 h incubation, 
resp ectively. After that , there was no significant removal of 
both FQs. No removal was detected in negative controls. As 
shown in Figure 2, the elimination of both studied FQs by immobilized laccase was a little  more than free laccase 
after the time which the elimination curve reach ed to its 
highest levels. Our results  on the immobilized laccase 
displayed a higher elimination than free laccase , was in 
agreement with previous studies by Rahmani et al.  
(Rahmani  et al. , 2015) , and Peralta -Zamora et al.  (Peralta -
Zamora  et al. , 2003) . This results show that the 
immobilization of laccase on CPC is a useful method for 
elimination of applied FQs.

and immobilized laccase.  Data show the mean value ± SD (n = 3)  
3.4. Effect of temperature, pH, and laccase concentration 
on FQs removal  
As shown in Figure 3a, the optimal range of temperature 
for both FQs removal was between 40 °C and 50 °C for both 
free and immobilized laccase. The h ighest removal of ENR 
(75.5 % and 81.5 % for free and immobilized laccase, 
respectively) and FLU (68 % and 72 % for free and 
immobilized laccase, respectively) occurred when the 
temperature was 45 °C. According to results the 
immobilized laccase showed hig her removal of both 
applied FQs than that of the free laccase, and the optimal 
temperature was same degree for both free and 
immobilized laccase. These results were in agreement with 
the results  of Wang et al.  (Wang  et al. , 2012) , who reported 
that the imm obilized laccase on magnetic mesoporous 
silica nanoparticles showed  higher phenol degradation 
(69.2 %) than that of the free laccase (35.7 %) at the 
optimal temperature of 25 °C. In the case of free laccase, 
the removal percentage of both applied FQs decre ased 
significantly at 55 °C, although, these decrease were not 
statistically significant in the presence of immobilized 
laccase. It may be illustrate by this fact that, due to thermal 
denaturation of the tertiary structure, the laccase loses 
activity (Kurn iawati and Nicell, 2008) , however, the 
immobilized laccase has relative stability against 
denaturing agents like temperature (Champagne and 
Ramsay, 2010; Fernández -Fernández  et al. , 2013) . 
APPLICATION OF FREE AND IMMOBILIZED LACCASE FOR REMOVAL AND DETOXIFICATION OF FLUOROQUINOLONES   245 
 
Figure  3. Effect of (a) temperature, (b) pH, (c) laccase activity on 
removal of ENR and FLU assisted by free and immobilized 
laccase. Data show the mean value ± SD (n = 3) and signiﬁcancy 
(*) was checked after ANOVA analysis (Dunnett's T3 post -hoc 
test) of obtained data (p -value < 0.05)  
Effect of pH on applied F Qs removal was studied at 
different pH values varying from 3.5 –5.5 ( Figure 3b). 
The results show that the both free and immobilized 
laccase exhibit the maximal removal of ENR and FLU at pH 
5.0 and pH 4.5, respectively. The difference between the 
optimal pH  for ENR and FLU removal might depend on the 
substrate structure and oxidation mechanism (Weng  et al. , 
2013) . As shown in Figure 3b, the relative removal of free laccase at pH 3.5 decreased by 58 % (ENR) and 53 % (FLU), 
though, it decrease by 64.66 % (ENR)  and 58 % (FLU) in the 
case of immobilized laccase. At pH 5.5, the decreases in the 
removal efficiency of both FQs by immobilized laccase w as 
at a slower rate than that of the free laccase. This results 
were in agreements with this fact that most of the fu ngal 
laccases like laccases from Coriolus hirsutus , Trichoderma 
atroviride , Cerrena unicolor 059  and Trametes versicolor 
work optimally at mild acidic pH (4 –6) (Sadhasivam  et al. , 
2008; Weng  et al. , 2013; Rahmani  et al. , 2015) . 
Figure 3c shows the profiles of both free and immobilized 
laccase concentration role on the removal efficiency of ENR 
and FLU. As it can be realized from this figure, the removal 
of both ENR and FLU using free and immobilized form of 
laccase significantly increased  when laccase activity was 
enhanced up to 6 U ml−1, while after that (up to 12 U ml−1), 
did not show a signiﬁcant increase on both ENR and FLU 
removal. The recent study of Rahmani et al.  (Rahmani  et 
al., 2015) , showed that increasing of laccase concentrati on 
from 0.1  to 0.8 U ml−1 significantly increased the removal 
percentages  of sulfonamides assisted by free or 
immobilized laccase, though, further increasing up to 1.2 U 
ml−1 did not have a signiﬁcant effect on removal 
percentage. T he same results were rep orted by Mogharabi 
et al.  (Mogharabi  et al. , 2012) , who observed that 
decolorization of synthetic dyes significantly increased as 
enzyme quantity increased from 0 .5 to 2.5 mg  ml−1. 
However, further enhancement of enzyme quantity up to 
5 mg ml−1 did not have a signi ﬁcant effect on 
decolorization.  Also, same result was observed in study of 
Asadgol et al.  (Asadgol  et al. , 2014) , which showed that 
increasing of laccase quantity from 1 to 10 U ml−1 
significantly enhanced both phenol and bisphenol A 
removal, h owever further increasing up to 20 U ml−1 did not 
have a signiﬁcant effect on removal efficiency.  
3.5. Effect of HBT and HBA concentration on FQs removal  
Results of removal study using free and immobilized 
laccase in absence and presence of HBT are showed in 
Figure 4a. In the case of ENR, the removal efficiency by free 
and immobilized laccase without HBT was 75 % and 81 %, 
respectively, while removal percen tages were signiﬁcantly 
increased (90 % and 92 % for free and immobilized laccase) 
by increasing the HBT concentration up to 0.5 mM. By 
increasing the HBT concentration up to 2 mM, removal 
percentages were received to 95 % and 98 % for free and 
immobilized  laccase,  respectively. While, by further 
increasing of HBT concentration (3 mM) removal 
percentages were decreased by 87 % and 94 % for free and 
immobilized laccase, respectively ( Figure 4a). In the case of 
FLU, increasing of HBT concentration from 0 to 2  mM 
significantly enhanced removal percent from 68 % and 72 
% to 90 % and 96 % assisted by free and immobilized 
laccase, respectively. However, at a higher concentration 
of HBT (3 mM), significantly decreased  (72 % and 81 %, 
assisted by free and immobilize d laccase, respectively) 
removal percent age (Figure 4a). The removal percentages 
decreased in the high concentration of HBT, may be due to 
this fact that the nitroxide radical resulting from laccase 
oxidation of HBT could have toxic effect on laccase. Our 
246  ASHRAFI  et al.  
results were in agreement with those of Mechichi et al.  
(Mechichi  et al. , 2006) , who observed no toxic e ﬀect of the 
HBT at concentrations between 0.125 and 2.5 mM on 
decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R, however a 
concentration of 5 mM showed inhibit ion of decolorization 
and significantly decreased decolorization percentage.  
 
Figure  4. Effect of (a) HBT and (b) HBA concentration  on removal 
of ENR and FLU assisted by free and immobilized laccase. Data 
show the mean value ± SD (n = 3) and signiﬁcancy (*) was 
checked after ANOVA analysis (Dunnett's T3 post -hoc test) of 
obtained data (p -value < 0.05)  
In the case of HBA, removal exper iments were studied at 
different concentration varying from 1 –6 mM ( Figure 3b). 
According to results, removal of ENR and FLU (75 %, 81 % 
for ENR and 68 %, 72 % for FLU using free and immobilized 
laccase without HBA, respectively) were significantly 
increas ed (95 %, 96 % for ENR and 85 %, 88 % for FLU using 
free and immobilized laccase, respectively) by increasing 
HBA concentration from 0 to 2 mM and 4 mM, respectively. 
While removal percentages for both ENR and FLU were not 
signiﬁcantly increased by further  increasing the HBA 
concentration up to 6 mM ( Figure 3b). Of the natural 
mediators (ethyl 4 -hydroxybenzoate, methyl 4 -
hydroxybenzoate, reduced glutathione, cysteine, 
methionine, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, oxidized glutathione 
and HBA) tested by Maruyama (Maruy ama  et al. , 2007) , 
HBA (5 mM) resulted in 80 % degradation (more than other mediators testified) of imazalil assisted by laccase after 24 
h of reaction.  
3.6. Reusability of the immobilized laccase  
Immobilization of enzyme facilitate their possible reuse for 
several reaction cycles and the overall cost of the process 
would be reduced (Champagne and Ramsay, 2010; 
Rahmani  et al. , 2015) . As shown in Figure 5, the relative 
removal of both studied FQs was signiﬁcantly decreased by 
increasing the cycle number of applic ation. In the current 
study, the immobilized laccase exhibited the relative 
removal of 95.44 %, 77.67 %, 46.22 % and 17.63 % for ENR 
and 89.48 %, 65.27 %, 38.88 % and 15.62 % for FLU, after 
the 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th cycles number , respectively. 
The immo bilized laccase on magnetic mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles retained 71.3 % of its initial degradation 
ability after 10 cycle of phenol degradation (Wang  et al. , 
2012) . The same results was reported by Rahmani et al.  
(Rahmani  et al. , 2015)  who observed a 6 3.3 % and 82.6 % 
of initial removal activity of immobilized laccase remained 
after 10th cycles of sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole 
removal, respectively. However, a study by Sathishkumar 
et al.  (Sathishkumar  et al. , 2012) , showed that no 
biocatalytic act ivity was retained after 8th cycles of 
diclofenac degradation.  This declines in relative removal 
ability, indicated that laccase activity was decreased after 
each round, might be due to laccase inactivation by 
degradation products and other parameters (Sathishkumar  
et al. , 2012; Wang  et al. , 2012; Fernández -Fernández  et al. , 
2013) .

ENR and FLU removal. Data show the mean value ± SD (n = 3) 
and signiﬁcancy (*) was checked after ANOVA analysis of 
obtained data (p -value < 0.05)  
3.7. Toxicity assays  
In recent years, different toxicity as say techniques have 
been developed in order to examine the toxicity of 
pollutants and their products after degradation process 
(Ben Younes  et al. , 2012; Ashrafi  et al. , 2013) .  For this 
purpose, growth inhibition percentage (GI %) was 
measured (for three gr am-positive and three gram -
negative bacterial strains) for the evaluation of the toxicity 
of both applied FQs and their related treated solution. 
According to results ( Table 2), the GI % of both applied FQs 
APPLICATION OF FREE AND IMMOBILIZED LACCASE FOR REMOVAL AND DETOXIFICATION OF FLUOROQUINOLONES   247 
was significantly reduced for each treated ENR an d FLU 
solution compared to untreated. The results showed that, 
the solution treated by laccase mediated with HBT has the 
lowest GI % compared to the others. A description might 
be that laccase  mediated with HBT has the more removal 
efficiency of each FQs a gainst the laccase without 
mediators and with HBA. The most GI % of ENR and FLU, 
was 78.2 % and 80  % for E. coli strain, which decreased to 
34 % and 12.2 %, after treating by the laccase mediated 
with HBT, respectively. These results  were in agreement 
with Younes et al.  who reported that the GI % of malachite 
green against E. coli  was enhanced from 2 to 99 % after 
treatment by laccase (Ben Younes  et al. , 2012) . In our previous work, the obtained results of toxicity study using 
six standard bacterial strain s howed that the GI % in 
presence of laccase -treated 13 synthetic dyes decreased 
significantly (Ashrafi  et al. , 2013) . The results of the 
Rahmani et al.  (Rahmani  et al. , 2015) , study showed that 
the GI % of sulfathiazole and sulfamethoxazole was 
signiﬁcantly reduced from 88 % and 81 % to 40.3 % and 
28.6 %, following the addition of a laccase -HBT treated 
solution to cultivation media of E. coli  strain. In the study of 
Pereira et al.  (Pereira  et al. , 2009 ), the GI % of Sudan 
Oran ge G reduced from 65.9 to 20 % for S. cerevisiae  after 
treating by laccase.

4. Conclusions  
A CPC silica carriers  was used for immobilization of  laccase. 
Temperature , pH and storage  stability of immobilized 
laccase increased significantly.  Furthermore, the broader 
temperature  and pH profiles  than the free laccase have 
been exhibited by the immobilized  laccase . The present 
study demonstrated that FQ antibiotics (ENR and FLU) are 
removed by treatment with the free and immobilized 
laccase. Additionally, i t was conﬁrmed that the r emoval 
percentages of ENR and FLU enhanced in the presence of 
the redox mediators HBT and HBA.  
The immobilized laccase performed a good reusability. The 
removal efﬁcacy of ENR and FLU was still as high as 46.22 
% and 38.88 %, respectively, after 15th cycle s umber . The 
results of microtoxicity test (growth inhabitation 
percentage, GI %, of three gram -positive and three gram -
negative bacterial strains) showed a significant decrease in 
toxicity of the laccase -treated ENR and FLU solution.
