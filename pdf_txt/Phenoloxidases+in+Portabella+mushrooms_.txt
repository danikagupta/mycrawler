This study aimed to extract and purify polyphenol oxidase enzyme (PPO) from 
mushrooms and use it in pastry industry. The enzyme was extracted from edible 
mushroom using different buffers and purified by several steps. Some Characterizations of 
the isolated PPO were studied. The activity of PPO was evaluated using 
spectrophotometric method and catechol as a substrate. Characterization studies indicated 
that the enzyme showed the highest specific activity 2087 U/mg protein at pH 6.0 using 
0.2M phosphate buffer. The ratio of 1:2 (w:v) from mushroom: buffer was the best for 
obtaining the highest specific activity (2490 U/mg protein). The optimum time of 
extraction of PPO was 10 mins to obtain high specific activity (2625 U/mg protein). The 
precipitation of ammonium sulfate and ion -exchange chromatography techniques were 
performed to purify PPO. The precipitation with saturated solution of ammonium sulfate 
(70%) was used, the Specific activity was 4332.7 U/mg protein with purification fold of 
1.7 and enzymatic yield of 65.5%. Ion exchange chromatography using DEAE cellulose 
column estimated that the purification times of the enzymatic extract were 6.01, with an 
enzymatic yield 22.3%. Storage study of the PPO in edible mushroom at 4oC for 3 months 
indicated that the PPO loss the stability gradually over time, 33% from its original activity 
retained after 32 days. It can be concluded that edible mushroom is a good source of PPO 
and the enzyme still active when the mushroom was stored for one month.  
1. Introduction  
There are many types of mushrooms that are widely 
consumed as food for their high nutritional value and 
distinctive flavor as well as medicinal values. 
Mushrooms have high content of antioxidants and low 
energy value. They contain vitamins, dietary fibers, 
proteins, minerals and all the essential amino acids 
needed by humans (Kalač, 2009). Edible mushrooms 
also have good contents of biologically active 
compounds such as ascorbic, alkaloids, carotenoids, 
flavonoids, folate acid, glycosides, lectins, phenols, 
terpenoids, tocopherols. These compounds are effective 
for the prevention of various types of diseases (Kalač, 
2013; Valverde et al., 2015). The mushrooms have also 
been used for prevention and treating some diseases such 
as Parkinson's, Zheimer's, high blood pressure and the 
risk of stroke, tumor and cancer. In addition, mushrooms 
contain antimicrobial agents, immune system boosters, 
and cholesterol -lowering agents (Valverde et al., 2015).   
Food manufacturers suffer from undesirable 
coloration in the products that cause problems in the industry, such as the browning of potatoes, eggplant and 
apples when cutting, and this is undoubtedly considered 
a major obstacle in the food industry. This effect persists 
during the storage period and reduces the quality of the 
food and changes the color, flavor and sensory 
properties. The food coloring is attributed to one of these 
enzymatic and non -enzymatic changes. There is another 
desired or intended change, such as the baking of bread, 
and this is the result of non -enzymatic browning, such as 
the caramelization of saccharides and Maillard reactions, 
and these reactions can be controlled by several factors 
when used in intended tasks in the food industry (Fang, 
2007).  
Phenols are found in food, the environment and 
ubiquitous in nature. These phenols cause food 
coloration and reduced nutritional and market value. 
Phenols have antioxidant properties and work against 
cancer and heart disease. There are three main types of 
polyphenol oxidase, classified according to the 
properties of the substrate and their mechanism of action: 
tyrosinase, catechol oxidase and laccase (ŞimŞek and 65 Morgab et al. / Food Research 7 (4) (2023) 64 - 70 
 https://doi.org/10.26656/fr.2017.7(4).006  © 2023 The Authors. Published by Rynnye Lyan Resources  FULL PAPER  Yemenicioğlu, 2007; Queiroz et al., 2008).  
Polyphenol oxidase is a copper enzyme which 
performs the catalysis of two different reactions that 
include molecular oxygen as catalyst and phenol. It 
converts monohydroxyphenols to dihydroxy phenols o -
diphenols and then oxidizes to o -quinones and then 
polymerizes the quinones by the active enzyme 
cresolasen to form red or black colored pigments 
(Pandey  and Rizvi, 2009; Li et al ., 2014). Polyphenol 
oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of phenols, which is 
responsible for the enzymatic browning in vegetable 
products and seafood, and the formation of melanin in 
the skin (Mishra and Gautam, 2016). Tyrosinase 
represents the main enzyme that is responsible for the 
enzymatic fruit browning after harvest and the formation 
of melanin in mammals, an undesirable phenomenon 
(Fernandes and Kerkar, 2017). This enzyme was named 
based on the individual substrate it was found to act on 
like the phenolase, tyrosinase, catecholase, catechol 
oxidase, diphenol oxidase, cresolase and monophenol 
oxidase. The structure of the active site of the enzyme 
includes 2 copper ions, linked by 6 histidine linkages and 
one cysteine linker. This enzyme is universally 
distributed in animals, fungi, plants, and bacteria. The 
abovementioned enzyme is necessary in plants to defend 
against predators such as herbivores and insects. (Mishra 
and Gautam, 2016). This enzyme can be intracellularly 
found in nearly all of the living things, which include 
animals, plants, and micro -organisms. In the plants, they 
are involved in the defense mechanism. In the case 
where the plant is bruised or cut, some of the phenolic 
compounds are oxidized when the oxygen is present for 
the formation of a polymeric structure that inhibits 
microbes (Whitaker, 1996; Alnori et al.,  2022).  
Because edible mushroom represents a potential 
source of PPO, this study was conducted in order to 
extract and purify polyphenol oxidase from it, study 
some properties of the enzyme and use it in the pastry 
industry as a browning aid.  
 
2. Materials and methods  
2.1 Plant collection  
Edible mushroom that has been utilized in the 
present work was obtained from local market in 
Baghdad, Iraq. The edible mushroom was washed a 
number of times by using tap water and then it has been 
cut and stored at 4°C for further experiments.  
2.2 Chemicals  
Characterizing PPO has been carried out at 
chemistry laboratory - College of Agriculture -University 
of Anbar. All of the solvents and other chemicals were from analytical grade and obtained from Sigma -Aldrich 
and BDH Chemicals.  
2.2.1 Extraction of the enzyme  
All extraction steps of PPO have been performed at a 
temperature of 4oC, 5 g of edible mushroom were 
homogenized and obtained under conditions of our 
experiments below.  
2.2.2 Determination of polyphenol oxidase activities  
Polyphenol oxidase activities have been 
characterized with using spectrophotometric approach 
(UV-vis. spectrophotometer, Shimadzu UV -1800, 
Japan), which is based upon initial increase rate in the 
absorbance at 410nm at a temperature of 25oC (Soleva et 
al., 2001). The solution of the phosphate buffer pH 7 
(0.10M, 1.95mL), 1mL of 0.10M catechol as substrate 
and 50μL of the extract of the enzyme have been 
pipetted to a test tube and then vigorously mixed. After 
that, this mix has been transferred rapidly into 1cm path 
length cuvette. The activity curves straight -line section 
as time function has been utilized for the determination 
of the activity of the enzyme (An enzyme activity unit 
has been characterized as a change of 0.001 in the value 
of the absorbance under assay conditions) (Arnnok et al., 
2010). All the determinations have been carried out in 
triplicates.   
2.2.3 Determination of protein contents  
Protein content has been determined in all of the 
preparations that have been utilized for the PPO assay 
through calorimetric approach that has been described 
by. Values have been obtained by the graphic 
interpolations on calibration standard curve with the 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 595 nm.  
2.2.4 Determination of the optimum buffer of 
extraction  
PPO activity has been determined at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8 
and 9 pH values with the use of 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 
3-5), Tris -HCl (pH 8 and 9) and phosphate buffer (pH 6 
and 7). time of extraction was 15 mins, and the ratio of 
extraction was 1:4 (w:v). the enzyme activity and the 
protein concentration were estimated, and the specific 
activity was calculated for the determination of optimal 
time to extract the enzyme.  
2.2.5 Determination the best concentration for 
extraction  
Different concentration (0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) 
were tested for the extraction of PPO from edible 
mushroom using phosphate buffer (pH 6) with 1:4 (w:v) 
ratio at 15 min for time extraction. The enzyme activity  Morgab et al. / Food Research 7 (4) (2023) 64 - 70 66 
 https://doi.org/10.26656/fr.2017.7(4).006  © 2023 The Authors. Published by Rynnye Lyan Resources  FULL PAPER  and concentration of the protein were estimated. the 
specific activity has been estimated to determine the 
optimal time for extracting the enzyme.  
2.2.6 Determination the optimum ratio of extraction  
 A total of six extraction ratio including (1:1, 1:2, 
1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6) (w:v) were examined to choose the 
optimum ratio for extraction the PPO from plant using 
0.2M phosphate buffer pH 6 and 15 mins. for extraction 
time. The enzyme activity and concentration of the 
protein were estimated. The specific activity has been 
estimated for the determination of the best time to extract 
the enzyme.  
2.2.7 Determination the best time for extraction  
Various durations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mins) 
have been tested for the extraction of PPO from edible 
mushroom using 0.2 M phosphate buffer and pH 6 with 
ratio 1:2 (w:v). the enzyme activity and protein 
concentration were estimated. the specific activity was 
calculated to determine the best time to extract the 
enzyme.  
2.3. Ammonium sulfate precipitation  
The determination of optimum ammonium sulfate 
concentration for purifications was through treating 
ammonium sulfate 70% (Gulcin et al., 2005). Following 
the weighing of concentrations of the ammonium sulfate, 
mixing the enzyme slowly with stirrer over night at 4oC 
to a point in which it is homogeneous. Afterwards, 
centrifugation through a speed of 3,500 rpm for 30 mins 
at 4oC, after completing of the centrifugation process, the 
precipitate was dissolved in 0.10 M of the Na -phosphate 
buffer (pH 7) and dialyzed against the sucrose. The 
activity of the enzyme and the concentration of the 
protein have been estimated for the solutions.  
2.4 Ion exchange chromatography  
DEAE -cellulose column was prepared according to a 
method of (Whitaker, 1972). The dialysate was loaded 
on the ion exchanger column DEAE cellulose (15×2.5 
cm). The separated fractions have been obtained at a 
0.50 mL/min flow. The washing step has been 
accomplished with the use of 0.005 M Tris -HCl buffer 
(pH 7.2), whereas the step of the elution has been 
accomplished with the use of the same buffer with 
sodium chloride salt gradient  concentration has been in 
the range of (0.10 -1N). The absorbance of every one of 
the fractions has been calculated at a 280nm wavelength 
for the fractions of wash and elution, the activity of the 
enzyme has been estimated in fractions, after that, the 
parts of the activation have been severally collected. The 
activity of the PPO and the concentration of the protein have been estimated  (Abdulhakeem et al., 2020).  
2.5 Storage stability  
The enzyme solutions were stored at 4°C for 3 
months. PPO activity was measured every 7 days.  
2.6 The use of polyphenol oxidase in the pastry industry  
A spoonful of yeast and a spoonful of sugar was 
dissolved in warm water. warm water, half a cup of 
cooking oil and a teaspoon of salt were added to one 
kilogram of flour and mixed well, then leaved until it 
ferments well. Then the dough is distributed in the form 
of flat balls in a plate, part of it is used as a control, while 
the other is painted on its surface with different 
concentrations of the extract (5, 10, 15, 100%) the pastry 
was prepared based on a traditional procedure with some 
modification.  
 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1 The extraction buffer  
 Different buffers with different pH and 
concentration including sodium acetate, potassium 
phosphate and Tris -HCl were used to determine the best 
buffer and its concentration for extraction method of 
enzyme. The results in Figures 1 and 2 showed the 
differences of PPO activity according to different buffer 
pH and concentration, the 0.2M phosphate buffer with 
pH = 6 was the best buffer for extraction in which 
enzyme activity was 448 U/mL and specific activity was 
2087 U/mg protein.

edible mushroom.  
Figure 2. Effect of different concentration of phosphate 
buffers on PPO extraction from edible mushroom.  67 Morgab et al. / Food Research 7 (4) (2023) 64 - 70 
 https://doi.org/10.26656/fr.2017.7(4).006  © 2023 The Authors. Published by Rynnye Lyan Resources  FULL PAPER  From the above result it can be seen that the acidic or 
amphoteric pH was better in enzyme extraction from 
edible mushroom, and the differences in values of 
specific activity belong to effective of nature of buffer 
and pH because it has the ability to removing the 
linkages that exist between enzyme and other cellular 
compounds (Chesworth et al ., 1998; Hadi and Mariod, 
2022).  
There are many studies that used different buffers 
with different pH values for the extraction of the PPO 
from a variety of sources. The optimum pH value is 7 for 
Mushroom PPO using catechol as substrate (Zhang and 
Flurkey, 1997). Maximum activities of the PPO have 
been observed at pH 4.50 for catechol as substrate 
(Gulcin et al. , 2005). The optimal values of the pH are 
6.80 and 5.50 for butter lettuce PPO with the use of 4 -
methycatechol and catechol as substrates, respectively 
(Gawlik -Dziki et al ., 2008). These differences may be 
attributed to the different sources of mushroom.  
3.2 The optimum ratio of polyphenol oxidase extraction  
   Six ratios were chosen (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 and 
1:6) (w:v) to determine the best ratio of PPO extraction 
by using phosphate buffer 0.2 M and pH  =  6 (Figure 3), 
the specific activity was measured for crude extract when 
it recorded the highest value in 1:2 ratio, it was 2490 U/
mg protein, followed by 1:1 with 2448 U/mg protein, 
while the 1:6 ratio gave the lowest specific activity 2016 
U/mg protein. When the material -liquid ratio was 
between 1:3 -1:6, the activity and specific activity of 
polyphenol oxidase decreased. The reason may be that 
with the increase of material -liquid ratio, the 
concentration of enzyme was diluted and more hetero -
proteins were extracted from mushrooms, leading to the 
decrease of polyphenol oxidase activity (Mishra and 
Gautam, 2016). Yanjie et al . (2019) found some result 
(1:2 w/v) for the best extraction ratio of PPO that 
purified from shiitake mushrooms.  
 3.3 Time of extraction  
The specific activity of PPO in the extract of 
phosphate buffer with a concentration of 0.2 M, pH 6 
and an extraction ratio 1:2 in different time of extraction 
(5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mins.) was estimated to 
determine the optimal extraction time. The results 
showed that the optimal extraction time was 10 min 
(Figure 4). With a specific activity of 2625 U/mg 
protein. It was noted that the enzymatic activity begins to 
decrease with time (after 10 mins) due to the hydrolysis 
of proteins. The degree of degradation depends on the 
thermal stability of the protein. Determining the optimal 
extraction time is important due to the difference in the 
extractability of the enzyme from one source to another 
due to the diversity of materials present in the source and 
interfering with the enzyme (Rodwell et al., 2016).  
3.4 Storage stability  
The solutions of PPO have been stored at a 
temperature of 4oC and residual activities have been 
measured for the estimation of the activity loss 
throughout the period of storage (Figure 5). The results 
have indicated that the PPO has been characterized as 
loss the stability gradually over time. The retained 
activity is 33% from its original activity over 32 days of 
storage at 4oC. 
3.5 Partial purification of polyphenol oxidase  
A total of two steps was done to purify the PPO

crude extract by ammonium sulfate and ion exchange 
chromatography (DEAE -Cellulose). The ammonium 
sulfate used saturation ratios 70%, the specific activity 
after dialyzed was 4332.7U/mg, with a 1.70 purification 
fold, and a 65.50% yield as has been listed in Table 1. 
Ammonium sulfate has been utilized in the precipitation 
of the enzyme due to the fact that it is highly soluble and 
inexpensive in comparison to others salt types, 
unaffected in the stability of the enzyme and pH. The 
concentration by the ammonium sulfate based upon 
equilibrate the charges found in the protein surface and 
water layer disrupt that surrounds it, which results in its 
precipitation.  
    The enzyme solution that has been created from 
the step of the ammonium sulfate (after being dialyzed) 
was passed through the DEAE -Cellulose ion exchange 
column that already equilibrate with Tris -HCl buffer 
(0.005M, pH = 7.2), the elution step for bonded proteins 
done when the absorbency reaches the baseline using 
some buffer with salt gradient (0.1 -1 M) NaCl. The 
absorbance for wash and elution fractions were reading 
on 280nm. the results shown in appears four protein 
peaks in the washing step (Figure 6), and only 1 peak of 
them had shown low activity of the enzyme in the 
fractions (23 -29) so it's ignored. Two peaks had appeared 
in the step of the elution and only a single peak had 
shown high activity of the enzyme in the fractions (69 -
81) these results showed another isozyme of PPO 
different with pI and charge. the activity fractions in 
elution step were concentrated. The purification fold of 
PPO from elution step was 6.01 -fold and 22.3% yield 
(Table 1).   Ion exchange chromatography has been utilized in 
several PPO purification research from plant tissues. had 
been utilized in the DEAE - cellulose in the purification 
of the PPO from the Button Mushroom, the fold of the 
purification has been 16.36 with a yield of 26.6%. PPO 
from mushroom ( Lactarius piperatus ) has been purified 
with the use of the Sepharose 4B ‐L‐tyrosine ‐p‐amino 
benzoic acid affinity column, purification of this 
preparations was 13.9 -fold, some ion exchange 
chromatography columns used to purification PPO from 
variety sources. DEAE Sephadex A -50 column used to 
purification PPO from Seed of Melon (Catherine and 
Toluwase, 2021) and DEAE -Sepharose to purification 
PPO from leaves of Cleome gynandra (Gao et al., 2011; 
AL-WARSHAN et al.,2023).  
The most properties of ion exchange are the matrix 
(the ion exchanger is made up of an insoluble matrix to 
which the charged groups were bound covalently. 
Charged groups have been related to mobile counter 
ions, which may be exchanged reversibly with other ions 
of an identical charge with no matrix alteration), 
Charged groups (The existence of the charged groups has 
been considered one of the fundamental properties of the 
ion exchanger. The group type specifies ion exchanger ’s 
type and strength; their total amount and availability is a 
determination of its capacity.  
The results of using polyphenol oxidase extract with 
different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 100%) on the dough 
showed the occurrence of browning changes of different 
intensity in the color of the prepared dough. It was 
observed that the intensity of browning increases with 
increasing concentration of the extract (Figure 7). This is

 https://doi.org/10.26656/fr.2017.7(4).006  © 2023 The Authors. Published by Rynnye Lyan Resources  FULL PAPER  due to the high percentage of the enzyme in the extract 
and thus an increase in the enzymatic browning 
reactions.  
Enzyme polyphenol oxidase has been implicated in 
the reaction of the browning. It oxidises the O -diphenols 
into the O -quinones, which is a process resulting in the 
browning reactions in the wounded vegetables, fruits, 
and plants including apple and garden egg (Adam et al., 
2016; Hadi et al., 2021). Studies were conducted to 
compare total phenolic content and polyphenol oxidase 
(PPO) activities in various milling fractions and 
determine the role of PPO in flour and dough color. 
results demonstrated that the browning of dough after 30 
mins from dough preparation caused significant decrease 
in brightness probably due to PPO activity. Therefore, 
the dough color was more highly correlated with PPO 
activity.  
It has been concluded that the PPO activity levels of 
the wheat flour is the reason behind color changes of the 
dough throughout the storage and may be considerably 
regulated with the flour heat treatment. On the other 
hand, the effects of the heat treatments on the activity of 
the PPO have been associated to the treatment approach 
and duration (Yadav et al., 2010).
