INTRODUCTION
Microphytobenthic communities inhabiting the
intertidal and shallow subtidal mud and sand flats ofestuaries and coastal zones are largely dominated bydiatoms and/or cyanobacteria. These organisms havebeen identified as some of the most important pri-mary producers in coastal ecosystems (MacIntyre et
al. 1996), playing a significant role as (1) facilitatorsof carbon transfer among trophic levels (Bellinger etal. 2009), (2) mediators of nutrient cycling and ex -
change across the sediment−water interface (Sund-bäck et al. 2000) and (3) efficient sediment stabilizers(Underwood & Paterson 2003).

ABSTRACT: The close coupling of photosynthesis and light was studied in 2 contrasting diatom-
dominated coastal sediments (sand and mud flats) using O 2microelectrodes and fiber-optic micro-
probes for scalar irradiance. The diatom community of the muddy sediment was composed almostexclusively of motile epipelic species, whereas in the sandy sediment similar contributions of epi -
psammic and epipelic diatoms were observed. The attenuation coefficient of scalar irradiance (K
0)
was significantly higher in the mud, where light was attenuated exponentially with depth from thesediment surface. In the sand, scalar irradiance levels increased in the first 0.1–0.2 mm due to highscattering and low absorption. Attenuation of scalar irradiance was highest for wavelengths ofabsorption by major diatom photopigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids). Higher areal and volumetric rates of O
2respiration were found in illuminated sediments than those in the dark,
resulting from an increase in both O 2concentration and penetration depth and a direct stimulation
of heterotrophic processes. A lower light acclimation index (Ek) was observed for the muddy
 sediment community, indicating lower light acclimation compared to the sandy sediment commu-
nity. Areal and volumetric rates of photosynthesis were ~3 times higher in the muddy sediment.We conclude that higher photosynthetic rates in the finer sediment were determined by (1) a thin-ner and more densely populated photic zone, where the contribution of active photopigments tototal light absorption relative to that of photosynthetically inactive components was higher, and (2)differences in diatom species composition and dominant life-strategies, specifically the capacity ofcells to actively search for optimal light microenvironments in the fine-grained sediment.

The microenvironment of these densely populated
microphytobenthic communities is complex andcharacterized by steep physical and chemical gradi-ents, including very strong light attenuation. Micro -
environmental heterogeneity in benthic communitiesis more pronounced than in planktonic systems, at aspatial scale comparable to the size and distancebetween the individual organisms (Underwood &Kromkamp 1999). Therefore, studies of microphyto-benthic photosynthesis require specialized tools toassess the distribution of light and photosyntheticactivity at relevant spatial scales. The use of fiber-optic scalar irradiance microprobes in combinationwith O
2microsensors is an ideal way to resolve how
the steep gradients of light intensity and spectralcomposition in sediments affect microbenthic photo-synthesis and other aspects of the photobiology ofmicrophytobenthos in their natural environments(Kühl et al. 1996, Kühl 2005).
Microphytobenthos colonizing sediments live in a
diffuse light field with a strong component of scat-tered light that is harvested from all directions (Kühl& Jørgensen 1992, 1994); thus, measurements ofdownwelling irradiance can significantly underesti-mate the light availability for photosynthesis in suchcommunities (Kühl et al. 1994). It is therefore of para-mount importance to relate photosynthesis at a givenpoint to scalar irradiance, i.e. the integral of radianceincident from all directions around a point in space(Lassen et al. 1992, Kühl & Jørgensen 1994). Light insedimentary environments is subject to intense ab -
sorption but also to a high degree of scattering due tothe high density of microalgae, detritus and sedimentparticles. This has several important consequencesthat may impact microphytobenthic photosynthesis,namely (1) strong light attenuation resulting in anextremely narrow photic zone, (2) local enhancementof scalar irradiance at the sediment surface due tointense scattering, and (3) rapid change in light qual-ity with depth resulting from differential absorption:a decrease of the wavelengths coinciding with photo -
pigment absorption maxima compared to other wave -
lengths in the light spectrum (Lassen et al. 1992,Ploug et al. 1993, Kühl & Jørgensen 1994, Kühl et al.1994, 1996).
Benthic diatom communities have traditionally
been divided into 2 main groups with regard to thelife-strategies they exhibit: the epipelon and the epip-sammon (e.g. Round 1965, Admiraal 1984). Theepipelon consists of motile diatoms that can movefreely between sediment particles and usually domi-nate in muddy sediments, whereas the epipsammonmostly comprises smaller, non-motile diatoms thatare attached to sand grains, and therefore are found
more commonly in sandy substrata. As this nomen-clature represents an oversimplification, a more re -
fined classification has recently been proposed, un -
coupling motility or attachment from sediment type(e.g. Ribeiro et al. 2013, Barnett et al. 2015). This in-cludes differentiation within the epipsammic groupbetween non-motile species, firmly attached (eitherstalked or adnate) to sand particles, and motile formsthat can move within the sphere of individual sandgrains. Motile epipelic diatoms may actively searchfor optimal light microenvironments, exhibiting verti-cal migratory rhythms determined by diurnal andtidal cycles (Round & Palmer 1966, Pinckney & Zing-mark 1991, Underwood et al. 2005) and irradiancelevels (Kromkamp et al. 1998, Perkins et al. 2010,Vieira et al. 2011). Epipsammon-dominated sand flatcommunities do not show such migratory patternsand photoregulate exclusively through physiologicalmechanisms (Jesus et al. 2009, Cartaxana et al. 2011).
Although several studies have characterized light
and/or O
2microenvironments in benthic systems
dominated by cyanobacteria and/or diatoms (e.g.Lassen et al. 1992, Ploug et al. 1993, Kühl et al. 1996,Glud et al. 2002, Brotas et al. 2003, Hancke & Glud2004, Al-Najjar et al. 2010, 2012), such measure-ments have never been done together in fine muddysediments with a typically migrating diatom commu-nity in order to assess the close coupling of photo -
synthesis and light. In this study, O
2microelectrodes
and fiber-optic microprobes for scalar irradiancewere applied to resolve the vertical variability of O
2,
light and photosynthesis in 2 contrasting diatom-dominated coastal sediments: highly cohesive finemud and coarse sandy sediment. We hypothesizedthat differences in photosynthetic rates in diatom-dominated sediments with distinct particle size com-position would be determined by light absorptionpatterns and dominant cell life-strategies. Oxygenbudgets and a detailed description of the diatomtaxo nomic composition of the 2 studied benthic com-
munities are presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sediment sampling and experimental set-up
Sediment samples (2 cm depth) were collected
from an estuarine mud flat in Lisbon, Portugal(38°47’46.7’’N, 09° 05’ 32.4’’W) and a sandy beach inHelsingør, Denmark (56° 02’48.5’’ N, 12° 36’ 07.3’’ E)using a rectangular acrylic corer (19.7 × 7.8 × 2 cm),36Cartaxana et al.: Light and O 2in diatom sediments
and were transferred with minimal disturbance to
custom-made acrylic flow-through chambers. In thelaboratory, a stable laminar flow of aerated seawaterwas maintained above the sediment surface (waterlayer depth: 1.5 cm; temperature: 16°C; salinity: 30)using a submersible water pump (Rena Flow 400)connected to the flow chamber and immersed in atemperature-controlled water reservoir.
Sediments were first exposed to an incident down-
welling photon irradiance (E
d; Table 1 provides a list
of abbreviations) of photosynthetically active radiation(PAR, 400–700 nm) of 75 µmol photons m
−2s−1for ap-
proximately 24 h. The sediments were illuminatedvertically from above with a fiber-optic tungsten halo-gen lamp (KL-2500, Schott) equipped with a collimat-ing lens, and E
dwas measured with a calibrated pho-
ton irradiance meter (ULM-500, Walz) equipped witha planar cosine collector (LI-190, LiCor). Sedimentswere exposed at each experimental photon irradiance(0, 250, 500 and 1000 µmol photons m
−2s−1) for at least
45 min prior to O 2and scalar photon irradiance meas-
urements. Changes in photon irradiance wereachieved without spectral distortion by adjusting theaperture size on the fiber-optic halogen lamp.
Sediment grain size composition was determined
by sequential sediment sieving, evaluating the relative contribution (% dry weight) of the size frac-
tions: >1000, 1000−500, 500−250, 250−125, 125−63and <63 µm.
Microphytobenthos biomass and taxonomic
 composition
Sediment samples (approximately the upper 2 mm)
were collected for biomass estimation and taxonomiccomposition analysis by scraping the surface with ascalpel. Approximately 100 mg of sediment were ex -
tracted for 24 h with 3 ml of 90% acetone for biomassestimation. Chlorophyll a(chla)concentrations were
determined on pigment extracts by spectrophoto -
metry (UV-2101PC, Shimadzu) using the method ofJeffrey & Humphrey (1975). Approximately 3 ml ofsediment was collected for taxonomic compositionanalysis and placed in 5 ml polypropylene tubes, towhich 1 ml of a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution wasadded, and stored at 4°C for later processing. Cellswere extracted from the sediment following an iso -
pycnic separation technique using silica sol Ludox®HS-40 (Sigma-Aldrich) that separates the organicmaterial from mineral particles, and is thus able to re -
move both migratory and non-migratory fractions ofthe diatom assemblages, as well as cyanobacteria,euglenids and other microphytobenthic algal groups
(Ribeiro 2010). Total cell counts were made directlyfrom the extract on an Olympus BX50 optical micro-scope, at 400× magnification.
Diatom identification and cell counts were made
on permanent slides of cleaned diatom material,mounted in Naphrax™, on a Zeiss Axioskop 50 micro-scope equipped with differential interference con-trast optical microscopy. The observation of theextracts showed that weakly-silicified diatoms, likeAtheya and Cylindrotheca , were an important part of
the assemblages. Therefore, to avoid the under -
estimation of these fragile genera, 2 types of slideswere made: one from diatom material incinerated ina  muffle-furnace for 2 h at 450°C to preserve fragile
specimens; and one from diatom material that wasoxidized by hydrogen peroxide (30%) at 90°C for 4 h,thus destroying the slightly silicified frustules, butallowing better identification of very small taxa. Inboth cases, >400 frustules/valves were counted.37

After determining the relative percentage of the
fragile diatoms (i.e. Cylindrotheca and Atheya spp.),
the relative abundance (percentage) of the other taxawas determined in the oxidized slide taking into con-sideration what was previously established for fragilespecimens (Ribeiro 2010). Diatom identificationmainly followed Ribeiro (2010) and Witkowski et al.(2000) and references therein.
Biovolume assessment followed the estimates pre-
sented by Snoeijs et al. (2002) and Ribeiro et al.(2013). In the cases of taxa that were not available inthose works, biovolume calculations were made fol-lowing Hillebrand et al. (1999). Size-classes and life-strategy information were primarily taken from Ri -
beiro (2010) and references herein, but followed thegrowth-form groups proposed by Barnett et al.(2015): epipelon (EPL), motile epipsammon (EPM-M)and non-motile epipsammon (EPM-NM) (no tycho-planktonic species — those that can live both in thesediment and in the water column — were observed).Diversity of the 2 studied microphytobenthic commu-nities was calculated using the Shannon index:

Microprofiling of O
2concentration and gross
photosynthesis
Depth profiles of dissolved O 2concentrations were
measured with fast responding (t90< 0.5 s) Clark-type
microelectrodes (tip diameter ~25 µm, OX-25, Uni -
sense A/S) at vertical steps of 0.1 mm. The O 2micro-
electrodes were connected to a pA meter (UnisenseA/S) and signals were recorded via a USB-interfacedA/D-converter (DCR16, Pyro Science) through de -
dicated PC-controlled data acquisition software(Profix, Pyro Science). The O
2microsensors were lin-
early calibrated at experimental temperature andsalinity from measurements in aerated seawater aswell as in seawater made anoxic by the addition ofsodium sulphite. The O
2microsensors were mounted
on a motor-driven micromanipulator (MU1, Pyro Sci-ence), which was interfaced to a desktop computerand controlled with the Profix software. Surface posi-tioning of the microsensors was done while observ-ing the sediment with a PC-interfaced USB digitalmicroscope (AD7013MZT Dino-Lite, AnMo Elec -
tronics). The microsensors were inserted into thesediment at an angle of 45° relative to the verticalincident light beam to avoid self-shading. The soft-ware automatically accounted for the sensor inser-tion angle; all depths are given in vertical distances.Volumetric gross photosynthesis rates (P
z, nmol O 2
cm−3s−1) were measured at 0.1 mm depth intervals
at the higher experimental photon irradiance (400–700 nm, 1000 µmol photons m
−2s−1) using the micro-
electrode light−dark shift technique (Revsbech & Jør-gensen 1983). In this method, the gross rate of photo-synthesis is estimated as the initial O
2depletion rate
at a specific depth during the first few seconds afterlight is briefly turned off (see also Glud et al. 1992).Depth integration over the sediment photic zoneyielded areal gross photosynthesis rates (P
g, nmol O 2
cm−2s−1).
Flux calculations of net photosynthesis 
and respiration
Sediment net areal photosynthesis (Pn) was calcu-
lated from steady-state O 2profiles in the light using
the flux of O 2(Jup) into the overlaying water through
the diffuse boundary layer (DBL) as calculated byFick’s first law of diffusion (Kühl et al. 1996):
J
up =Pn= −D0dC/dz (2)
where D0is the molecular O 2diffusion coefficient at
experimental salinity and temperature (from Tablefor seawater and gases, Unisense A/S) and d C/dzis
the linear concentration gradient in the DBL. Netphotosynthetic rates as a function of the incidentphoton irradiance, P
n(E), were fitted with an expo-
nential model (Webb et al. 1974), with an extra term,R, to account for O
2consumption (Spilling et al.
2010):
Pn(E)= Pmax(1 − exp−αE/Pmax) + R (3)
where Pmaxrepresents the maximum photosynthetic
capacity and αis the initial slope of the photo -
synthesis vs. irradiance curve. The compensationirradiance (E
c), i.e. the irradiance at which total O 2
production and consumption in the sediment bal-
anced each other, was determined when Pn(E)= 0.
The light ac climation index, Ek, i.e. the irradiance at
onset of photos ynthesis saturation was calculated
from Ek= Pmax/α.
Sediment areal respiration in the dark (Rdark) was
calculated by Eq. (2) as the linear flux of O 2into the
sediment through the DBL. The areal respiration ofthe sediment in the light (R
light) was calculated as the
difference between gross and net photosynthesis(P
g− Pn). Net photosynthesis and respiration were
also calculated for the photic zone alone (Kühl et al.1996). The areal net photosynthesis of the photiczone (P
n,phot) was calculated as the absolute sum of'– l o g e

the flux of O 2into the overlaying water across the
DBL (Jup) and the flux into the biofilm below the
photic zone (Jdown). Downward O 2flux at the lower
boundary of the photic zone was calculated as:
Jdown= −ΦDsdC/dz (4)
where Φis the sediment porosity, and Dsis the sedi-
ment diffusion coefficient, which was calculated fromthe porosity and D
0according to Iversen & Jørgensen
(1993). Sediment porosity was calculated from coreslicing and subsequent drying of known volumes ofsediment. The areal respiration of the photic zone(R
phot) was then calculated as Pg− Pn,phot. Average
volumetric rates of O 2respiration of distinct zones of
the sediment were calculated by dividing areal respi-ration rates determined from the flux calculationswith the depth of the photic zone or the O
2penetra-
tion depth (Kühl et al. 1996).
Light measurements
Spectral measurements of scalar irradiance (E0)
were done at 0.1 mm vertical depth intervals using ascalar irradiance microprobe connected to a fiber- optic spectrometer (USB2000+, Ocean Optics) inter-
faced to a PC running spectral acquisition software(Spectra Suite, Ocean Optics). The scalar irradiancemicroprobe consisted of a small diffusing sphere(80 µm diameter) cast on the coated tip of a taperedoptical fiber (Rickelt et al. 2016). The position and in-sertion angle of the scalar irradiance probe was con-trolled as described above for the O
2microelectrodes.
Photon scalar irradiance of PAR was obtained by
integrating scalar irradiance spectra from 400 to700 nm. The downwelling spectral scalar irradiance(i.e. E
d) at the sediment surface was measured by
positioning the scalar irradiance microprobe over ablack non-reflective light well at the same positionrelative to the vertically incident, collimated lightfield as the sediment surface. Scalar irradiance spec-tra at various depths in the sediment were normal-ized to the known incident downwelling photon irradiance at the sediment surface. Attenuation co -
efficients of photon scalar irradiance were calculatedfrom the depth profiles of spectral scalar irradianceas (Kühl 2005):
K
0= ln(E1/E2)/(z2− z1) (5)
where K0is the vertical spectral attenuation coeffi-
cient of scalar irradiance, and E1and E2are the spec-
tral scalar irradiance measured at depths z1and z2in
the sediment (where z2> z1).RESULTS
Sediment particle size and porosity
The 2 studied coastal sediments differed signifi-
cantly regarding particle size composition. Morethan 99% of the muddy sediment was composed ofparticles <63 µm (Fig. 1), with a porosity of 0.9. In thesandy sediment, the particle size distribution wasdominated by medium sand of 250–500 µm with 56%dry weight, followed by coarse and fine sand (500−1000 and 125−250 µm size-classes) with 18 and 16%dry weight, respectively. Small stones and brokenshells (>1000 µm) were also a significant part (9%) ofthe sediment. Particles <125 µm represented lessthan 1% of the sediment (Fig. 1), with a porosity of0.6.
Microphytobenthos biomass and community
composition
Concentrations of chl awere higher in the muddy
sediment, but only when expressed on a per dryweight basis: 229 ± 12 and 94 ± 23 µg chl ag
−1for the
mud and sandy sediment, respectively. On a volu-metric basis, similar chl aconcentrations were ob -
served: 108 ± 6 and 138 ± 34 µg chl acm
−3, for the
mud and sandy sediment, respectively. Diatoms dom-inated the micro phytobenthic communities of both
studied coastal sediments, with a relative abundanceof 95.6 and 90% of total cells in the muddy and sandysediment, respectively. In the muddy sediment, cyano -
bacteria of the genera Oscillatoria and Merismopedia
and euglenophytes represented only 1.5 and 2.9% ofthe total cell number. In the sandy sediment, the39

same 2 genera of cyanobacteria were present at a rel-
ative abundance of 8.3%, while green microalgaeand euglenophytes only made minor contributions(1.6 and 0.1%, respectively).
Diatom species richness (46) and diversity (H’ =
2.87) were higher in the sand than in the muddy sed-iment (28 and H’ = 1.99, respectively) (Tables 2 & 3).
The sandy sediment community was also more di -
verse in terms of life-strategies, with motile (18 spe-cies) and non-motile epipsammon (11) coexistingwith epipelic (17) diatoms (Table 3). In the mud,epipelic species were mainly observed (26 out of atotal of 28 species) (Table 2). In terms of relativeabundance, the muddy sediment was almost exclu-sively inhabited by epipelic diatoms (99.8%), whilein the sand, epipelic and epipsammic diatoms exhib-ited a similar contribution (~50%) to the microphyto-benthic community (Tables 2 & 3). In the muddy sediment, most of the identified species were large
diatoms, with 14 species having a biovolume of>1000 µm
3. In contrast, most of the identified diatoms
in the sand were small, with 33 species having a bio-volume <250 µm3. Nevertheless, medium sized dia -
toms (250 to 1000 µm3) dominated both muddy and
sandy communities in terms of relative abundance(in both cases, ca. 45%).
The microphytobenthic communities of the 2 stud-
ied sediments were also quite distinct in terms ofdiatom composition, sharing only 2 species (Cylindro -
theca closterium and Navicula gregaria) . The muddy
sediment was dominated by species of the generaNavicula (57.6% relative abundance), particularly N.
spartinetensis (34.5%) and N.cf. phyllepta (18.6%)
(Table 2). In the sand, the most representative spe-cies were the epipelic Navicula sp.1 (15.6%) and the
non-motile epipsammic Anorthoneis vortex (12.4%)
and Attheya decora (11.2%) (Table 3).
Scalar irradiance
Depth profiles of photon scalar irradiance were
rather different between the 2 studied coastal sedi-ments (Fig. 2): while scalar irradiance levels at the40

Spectral attenuation of scalar irradiance increased
from the infrared towards the blue part of the spec-trum in both sediments (Fig. 3). Light attenuationfor shorter wavelengths (400–50 nm) and around675 nm (the absorption maxima of carotenoids andchlorophylls) was more pronounced in the muddysediment. Spectral wavelengths outside the absorp-tion bands of major diatom photopigments, espe-cially in the near infrared region, penetrated deeperinto the sediments (Fig. 3).

The O 2concentration profiles also differed be -
tween the 2 sediment types (Fig. 4). In the muddysediment, O
2penetration increased with increasing
irradiance from about 1.5 mm in the dark to 2.4 and2.7 mm at 250 and 1000 µmol photons m
−2s−1. The O 2
concentration increased towards the muddy sedi-ment surface, defining an approximately 0.3–0.4 mmthick DBL, and O
2concentrations reached a maxi-
mum immediately below the sediment surface (0.1–0.2 mm depth). At higher irradiance, the upper partof the muddy sediment reached O
2concentrations of
~6 times air saturation (Fig. 4). The O 2penetration in
the sandy sediment was deeper than 4 mm (Fig. 4),with a thicker DBL (0.5–0.6 mm) and
with peak O 2concentrations at 0.5–
1.0 mm below the sediment surface,depending on the incident down-welling photon irradiance. At higherphoton irradiance, the upper part ofthe sandy sediment reached O
2con-
centrations of ~3 times air saturation
(Fig. 4).

average volumetric gross photosynthesis rates inthe photic zone were 10.5 and 3.0 nmol O

of 0.659 nmol O 2cm−2s−1, compared
to only 0.109 nmol O 2cm−2s−1in the
sandy sediment (Table 4).
Pnincreased with incident photon
irradiance for both studied sediments(Fig. 6). For the muddy sediment, netphotosynthesis rates were muchhigher, reaching values of 0.56 nmolO
2cm−2s−1, and saturating at higher
photon irradiance than in the sandysediment, where the highest net pho-tosynthesis rates achieved were0.10 nmol O

curve-fitting of Pnvs. photon irradi-
ance data, Pmaxwas estimated as 0.63

tively. The corresponding Ekindexes, estimated from
the interception of Pmax and α, were 314 and

became net O 2-producing), were 20 and 60 µmol
photons m−2s−1for the muddy and sandy sediments,
respectively.
Rdarkwas highest for the muddy sediment, whereas
Rphot rates were highest in the sandy sediment
(Table 4). Comparable areal respiratory rates underilluminated conditions were found in the 2 types ofsediment (Table 4). Areal respiration rates measuredin the light were considerably higher than in thedark. At a photon irradiance of 1000 µmol photons43

fore, the average volumetric O 2respiration in the

tively (Table 4). Considering the thicknesses of thephotic zones (0.6 and 1.3 mm for mud and sand, res -
pectively), average volumetric O

the corresponding productive zones were 0.65 and1.02 nmol O

DISCUSSION
Photon scalar irradiance at the surface of both
coastal sediment types was higher (about 120%) thanthe incident downwelling irradiance due to intenselight scattering in the uppermost sediment layers. Inthe sandy sediment, due to low light absorption andhigh scattering at the uppermost layers, a subsurfacescalar irradiance maximum was observed reaching150% of incident downwelling irradiance. This sug-gests that measurements of downwelling irradiance(the most commonly measured light parameter inbenthic studies) can underestimate the total lightintensity (i.e. the scalar irradiance) available for
microbenthic phototrophs. Kühl et al. (1994) showedthat measurements of downwelling irradiance canunderestimate light availability by >100%. Althoughthis represents an extreme value measured in highlyscattering sand with little absorption, scalar irradi-ance in the visible part of the spectrum typicallyreaches about 110 to 160% of the incident irradianceat the surface of most photosynthetic biofilms andsediments (Kühl et al. 1997).
Scalar irradiance was attenuated exponentially
with depth starting from the surface in the finemuddy sediment. The scalar irradiance attenuationcoefficient reported here for the muddy sediment(8.65 ± 0.40 mm
−1) is among the highest described for
benthic systems, comparable only to other highlycohesive, fine intertidal sediments (Cartaxana et al.2011) and microbial mats (Kühl et al. 1997). In bothsediments, strongest light attenuation was observedfor wavelengths around 675 nm and in the 400–550 nmrange, corresponding to absorption maxima of diatomphotopigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), espe-cially in the muddy sediment. Such differential lightabsorption led to a decrease with depth of the wave-lengths more relevant for photosynthesis, thus limit-ing photosynthetic activity in deeper sediment lay-ers. Ploug et al. (1993) related these changes in lightquality to the vertical zonation of a population of pen-nate diatoms over a dense underlying population offilamentous cyanobacteria that largely sustainedtheir oxygenic photosynthesis via phycobiliproteinswith absorption characteristics complementary tochlorophylls. At an incident downwelling photonirradiance of 1000 µmol photons m
−2s−1, photon
scalar irradiance values of about 6 and 200 µmol pho-tons m
−2s−1were measured at the lower boundary of
the photic zones in the muddy and sandy sediments,respectively. The relatively high light availability atthe lower boundary of the sandy sediment photiczone may indicate that parameters other than lightintensity may have limited photo synthesis. Accord-
ing to Kühl et al. (1996), the lower boundary of thephotic zone in cyanobacterial mats could result fromreduced light quality, nutrient limitation or the pres-ence of toxic compounds such as sulfide.
Significantly higher areal rates of O
2consumption
were found in illuminated sediments than in thedark. This could be the result of the observed gradualincrease of both O
2concentration and penetration
depth with irradiance as well as enhanced volumetricO
2respiration in and below the photic zone, resulting
from a direct stimulation of heterotrophic processes(Kühl et al. 1996). A similar pattern of light-enhanced44

respiration has been observed in cyanobacterial mats
(Kühl et al. 1996, Epping & Kühl 2000), although thevolumetric rates of respiration reported were 3 to 4times higher than in both sediments studied here,indicating a lower heterotrophic activity in diatom-dominated communities.
Areal and volumetric rates of photosynthesis were
~3 times higher in the muddy sediment, although themicrophytobenthos biomass (chl aper volume on
2 mm depth samples) was similar in mud and sand.Hence, differences in the distribution of the biomassalong the sediment profile and a thinner euphoticzone may explain the higher productivity of themuddy sediment. Microphytobenthos in muddy sedi -
ments has been shown to be highly stratified in themud, with most of the chl aoccurring in the top
0.5 mm, while in sandy sediments relatively constantconcentrations were found throughout the sedimentprofile down to a depth of several mm (Cartaxana etal. 2006). In relatively flat benthic systems, photo -
synthetic efficiency has been shown to be higher insediments and biofilms with a thinner and moredensely populated photic zone (Al-Najjar et al. 2012),as the one found in the muddy sediment we studied.The rationale is that the contribution of active pho-topigments to total light absorption relative to that ofphotosynthetic inactive components increases withaugmented biomass and a thinner photic zone. Onthe other hand, light attenuation by sand grains andmineral precipitates was probably highly relevant inthe sandy sediment, where the microphytobenthiccells were more dispersed and the photic zone waswider. Hence, maximum volumetric photosynthesishas been shown to correlate positively with light at -
tenuation in sediments/biofilms and in other aquaticplant communities (Al-Najjar et al. 2012, Krause-Jensen & Sand-Jensen 1998). Our results contrastwith those reported by Billerbeck et al. (2007), whoshowed higher photosynthetic rates in coarse andfine sands than in a muddy sediment.
Volumetric and areal rates of photosynthesis in the
diatom-dominated muddy sediment were similar tomaximum in situ rates measured in another mud flat
of the Tagus estuary (Brotas et al. 2003). Maximumphotosynthetic rates at saturating photon irradianceswere higher in the muddy sediment than in cyano-bacterial mats or cyanobacteria−diatom mixed bio-films (Kühl et al. 1996, Al-Najjar et al. 2010, 2012),but within the range compiled by Krause-Jensen &Sand-Jensen (1998) for microalgal mats. A lowerlevel of E
kwas observed for the muddy sediment,
corroborating the results of previous studies that mudflat diatom communities exhibit lower light acclima-tion compared to epipsammic-dominated sand flat
communities (Jesus et al. 2009, Pniewski et al. 2015).
Both studied coastal sediments were dominated by
diatoms exhibiting relative abundances >90%. How-ever, the species composition was very distinct in thatthe 2 different microphytobenthic communities onlyshared 2 common diatom species. Sediment particlecomposition, defined largely by hydrodynamic forcesthat control local sediment deposition and erosion,has been shown to be the most important parameterdetermining diatom species composition in coastalsediments (Sabbe & Vyverman 1991, Hamels et al.1998, Paterson & Hagerthey 2001, Ribeiro et al.2013). Our results confirm previous reported patternsindicating that larger epipelic diatom and smallerepipsammic diatom species are more abundant inmuddy and sandy sediments, respectively. However,half of the sand-dwelling diatoms were part of theepipelon, and medium size diatoms (250 to 1000 µm
3)
dominated both muddy and sandy communities interms of relative abundance. Diatom species richnessand diversity were higher in the sandy sediment withthe co-occurrence of motile epipelic and variousforms of non-motile (i.e. adnate, stalked) and motileepipsammon. This could be related to the morediverse particle size composition of the sandy sedi-ment and the sand-grain microtopography itself,allowing higher niche differentiation compared tothe more homo geneous muddy sediment (Ribeiro et
al. 2013).
Although both diatom communities were domi-
nated by motile species in terms of relative abun-dance, the importance of motility for the photo -
physio logy of the muddy sediment community was
much more prevalent. The light gradient in the mudwas much steeper, and typical free-moving epipelicdiatoms would experience significant changes inphoton irradiance simply by covering distances com-parable to their cell size. On the other hand, the lightenvironment in the sandy sediment was much morehomogeneous, requiring cells to travel much longerdistances to actively search for a different lightmicro environment. Furthermore, movement in mo -
tile epipsammic species is highly limited, i.e. re -
stricted to the sphere of individual sand grains orvery slow movement from sand grain to sand grain(Round 1979). Finally, the higher hydrodynamic forcing in the sandy sediment causes a continuous
re arrangement and sorting of the sand grains that
distributes the epipsammon more evenly, whilstdestroying or disrupting large accumulations of epi -
pelic diatoms at certain depths (Delgado et al. 1991,Paterson & Hagerthey 2001). Hence, the higher areal45Mar Ecol Prog Ser 545: 35–47, 2016
and volumetric rates of photosynthesis and higher
maximum photosynthetic capacity observed in themuddy sediment could also be related to the capacityof epipelic diatoms in this sediment to actively searchfor optimal light microenvironments. Kromkamp etal. (1998) proposed a ‘micromigration’ mechanism, inwhich cells would be continuously replaced by othersat the sediment surface, increasing light-use effi-ciency and preventing photoinhibition and CO
2limi-
tation. Micromigration could thus represent a rapid,flexible and energetically cheap way for benthicdiatoms to optimize productivity in fine grained sedi-ments (Serôdio et al. 2001).
This work describes the major differences in light
and O
2microenvironments of 2 diatom-dominated
microphytobenthic communities inhabiting distinctsubstrata. We conclude that the higher photosyn-thetic rates observed in the fine muddy sedimentwere related to (1) the compaction of the productivebiomass into a thin photic zone which reduces theabsorption of light by inactive sediment components,and (2) differences in diatom species compositionand dominant life-strategies, specifically the capacityof diatom cells to change their light microenviron-ment by moving within a steep irradiance gradient.
