Abstract 
The roots of Rubia tinctorum  L. have a long tradition in dyeing processes of textiles from 
centuries ago until present. The colouring principles belong to hydroxyanthraquinones. 
Concern arose because several of these compounds were recognised as mutagenic in vitro and 
even carcinogenic in rodents. To assess the possible risk for humans caused by textiles, the 
mutagenicity was investigated using two madder root samples of different origin (Iran and 
Bhutan) along the entire dyeing process from root extracts to the dyed wool using the 
Salmonella /microsome test with the strains TA 98, TA 100 and TA 1537 (Ames Test). 
Significant mutagenic effects could be detected in madder root extracts and also in the final 
product, the dyed wool. Madder root from Iran showed considerably higher mutagenic 
responses compared to samples from Bhutan. Analytical investigations of the extracts by 
HPLC showed the presence of a spectrum of anthraquinones typical for madder root. Three 
mutagenic compounds, lucidine, rubiadine and purpuroxanthine, together with non-mutagenic 
alizarine could be detected. The mutagenic response of the different samples was positively 
correlated with the concentration of the mutagenic anthraquinones and lucidine in particular. 
Based on these investigations a risk for dye house workers and consumers of textiles dyed 
with Rubia tinctorum  must be anticipated.  
 
1 1. Introduction 
Madder, the root of Rubia tinctorum  L., has a long tradition as a dyestuff because of its bright 
red colour. The red pants of Napoleons army and the red coats of the English soldiers in the Jäger, Hafner, Welsch, Schneider, Iznaguen, Westendorf: The mutagenic potential  o f madder root in                                                  2 / 17 18th/19th century were all dyed with madder. After the synthetic availability of alizarine in 
1868 madder lost most of its importance as dye stuff for textiles, although its use never ceased 
totally since today. In recent years madder root retrieves importance in the context with 
clothes exclusively dyed with natural dyes. Madder roots were also used in traditional 
medicine as a drug against kidney and bladder stones. All pharmaceutical products based on 
madder root were withdrawn from the European market in 1992 (BAnz., 1992) after several 
investigations became available to demonstrate the genotoxic potential of anthraquinones 
present in these products (e.g., Yasui and Takeda, 1983, Westendorf et al. 1988, Marec et al., 
2001, Tikkanen et al., 1983a, Tikkanen et al. 1983b, Westendorf et al. 1990, Mori et al. 1990, 
Kawasaki et al. 1992, Westendorf et al., 1998, Wölfle et al.,1990, Blömeke et al. 1992, 
Poginsky et al. 1991, Marczylo et al. 2000). An overview gives Derksen (2001). 
Although madder roots contain several hydroxyanthraquinones which are mutagenic in 
bacterial and mammalian systems, lucidine (1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl,9,10-
anthraquinone) was demonstrated to be most potent. It was shown that lucidine is able to form 
DNA adducts in vitro  and in vivo  after treatment of tissue culture or laboratory animals with 
the compound (Poginski et al. 1991). A correlation could be demonstrated between the 
formation of lucidine-DNA adducts and the formation of liver and kidney tumours in rats 
treated with madder roots in their diet for a period of two years (Westendorf et al., 1998). 
Recently the EU initiated a research project to investigate the possible risk of dyes used in the 
textile industry (Identification and Substitution of Mutagenic Dyes in Textile Finishing, 
QLK4-CT-200-70158) (Jäger et al. 2005, Schneider et al. 2004, Jäger et al. 2004). Among the 
five plant dyes investigated in this study, only madder root was known from the literature to 
contain genotoxic ingredients. In the present study the mutagenic potential of madder root 
solutions used in the dyeing process of textiles as well as the final product, the dyed wool was 
investigated in the Salmonella /microsome assay (Ames test) and the results were compared to 
the composition of hydroxyanthraquinones analyzed by HPLC analysis.  
2 2. Materials and Methods 
2.1  Test compounds 
An overview of the samples investigated is given in Fig. 1. Samples were taken directly from 
the standard dyeing process in a textile finishing company. Samples consist of unprocessed 
madder roots, four sequentially prepared root extracts with boiling water, the combined 
extracts used for dyeing of textiles, pressed cakes of madder roots after water extraction, the 
residual dyeing bathes after use and the final products the madder dyed wool. All samples 
were stored in 250 ml screw-caps PE-flasks in the freezer at -21 °C until further use. Wool 
strands of 20g each, wrapped in aluminium foil, were also stored in the freezer. Jäger, Hafner, Welsch, Schneider, Iznaguen, Westendorf: The mutagenic potential  o f madder root in                                                  3 / 17 2.2 Reagents 
Alizarine was purchased from Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany. Lucidine and 
Xanthopurine were synthesized according to Murti et al. (1970) modified by Poginsky (1989). 
Rubiadine was synthesized according to Blömeke (1991).  
For the cultivation of S. typhimurium  strains in the Ames Test Nutrient Broth No. 2 (Oxoid, 
Basingstoke, England) was used. Agar plates and soft agar were prepared with Bacto-Agar 
(Becton, Dickinson & Company, Sparks, U.S.A.) and Rat liver S9 Aroclor 1254 induced was 
purchased by Moltox Inc. Boone, U.S.A.. The positive control substances 2-nitrofurantoine, 
4-nitro-1,2-phenylendiamine and 2-aminoanthracene were purchased by Sigma Chemical, St. 
Louis, U.S.A..   
2.3 Sample preparation 
 The investigation of the aqueous samples in the bacterial mutagenicity test was performed 
directly after adjusting the pH value to 7.0 ± 0.2 and subsequent sterile filtration through a 
syringe filter (0.2 µ). Organic extracts of the aqueous phases were prepared by subsequent 
liquid extraction of 16-20 ml with equal amounts of ethyl acetate. The extraction was repeated 
3-7 times until the organic phase was colourless. The combined organic phases were 
evaporated in a rotary evaporator to dryness and dissolved in 1 ml DMSO. The solid samples 
(unprocessed roots, root press cakes, wool) were soxhlett extracted with ethyl acetate and 
subsequently with ethyl alcohol. After evaporation of the solvent the residues were dissolved 
in 1 ml DMSO per g dry weight. The wool was also extracted with artificial sweat in a 
modification of ISO 105-E04 (1994). Instead of histidine mentioned in this guideline, arginine 
had to be used because histidine would have influenced the bacterial mutagenicity test. Two 
artificial sweat solutions (pH 8.0 and pH 5.5) were prepared by dissolving 0.5 g/l L-arginine-
monohydrochloride. Tap water was used as control. The wool (1g) was shaken in 30 ml of 
these solutions in a shaking incubator at 130 rpm for 24 hours at room temperature. Extracts 
were filtered; the pH-value was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2 and sterilized using a syringe filter (0.2 
µ). 
2.4  Bacterial mutagenicity test 
The Salmonella /microsome assay was performed in accordance to the OECD guideline 471 of 
July 1998 and the Council Regulation No. 2000/32/EG, B. 13/14 of May 2000. Strains TA98, 
TA 100 and TA 1537 were included in the survey. The organic extracts of madder roots, 
residues of roots after extraction and residual liquid as well as wool extracts were investigated 
exclusively in TA100 because in the investigations of the dyeing baths and boiling extracts 
this strain responded more strongly and specifically showed the mutagenic activity of 
lucidine. Revertant colonies were counted with a semiautomatic colony counter. Samples 
were evaluated positive if the number of revertants was doubled in comparison to controls 
and/or a positive dose relationship occured.  Jäger, Hafner, Welsch, Schneider, Iznaguen, Westendorf: The mutagenic potential  o f madder root in                                                  4 / 17 2.5 Chemical analysis of anthraquinones 
The organic extracts investigated in the bacterial mutagenicity test were analysed for the 
presence of anthraquinones by HPLC-analysis. A Thermo-Finnigan HPLC-system equipped 
with a gradient pump, an auto sampler and a diode-array-detector was used. 20 µl of the 
DMSO solutions were injected on a RP-18-column and eluted with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. 
and a gradient of acetonitril (A) and 0.1% acetic acid (B): (0-5 min: 20% A, 5-15 min: 20-
45% A, 15-20 min.: 45% A, 20-30 Min.: 45-100 % A, 30-40 min.: 100 % A). Quantification 
of the anthraquinones in the extract was performed with the external standard method by use 
of identical reference compounds. 
3 Results 
3.1 Mutagenicity 
3.1.1 Aqueous dyeing bath and aqueous boiling extracts 
With the original aqueous dyeing baths (DBB, DBI) mutagenic responses could be observed 
with all three Salmonella typhimurium  tester strains (TA 1537, TA 100 and TA 98) (Tab. 1). 
The madder sample from Iran showed the highest responses in the absence of S9 mix, 
whereas the opposite effect was observed with madder sample from Bhutan. The highest 
induction rate of 8.2 was obtained with the dyeing bath prepared from madder samples of 
Bhutan in strain TA1537 in the presence of S9 mix. Without S9 activation the Bhutan dyeing 
bath was very toxic. 
Ethyl acetate extracts of the dyeing bath (DBB, DBI) showed mutagenic effects in TA100 for 
both origins, whereas only marginal increases of the mutation rate were observed with strain 
TA98 (Tab. 2). Similar results were observed for the aqueous boiling extracts 1-4 (AE1 – 
AE4, Tab. 2). Highest responses occurred with strain TA100 in the absence of S9 mix. In all 
four fractions the samples from Iran showed higher responses compared to samples from 
Bhutan. The peak of mutagenicity was obtained in the second boiling extracts of both origins, 
showing a slow mobilisation of the mutagenic anthraquinones from the root material. Extracts 
of the residual liquid of the dyeing bath from the Iran sample after use (RLI, Tab. 3) still 
showed mutagenic responses in TA100 with and without S9 mix (IR=6.2), whereas residual 
liquid from Bhutan was not mutagenic in TA100.  
3.1.2  Mutagenicity of madder roots before and after preparation of the dyeing bathes 
Strong mutagenic effects were observed for all extracts of madder root (MR, Tab. 3) with 
induction rates between 5.7 – 13.9 (TA100 with S9 mix). Samples from Iran, again, were 
more effective compared to samples from Bhutan. In addition toxic effects occurred 
especially in the tests without metabolic activation and in the extracts with ethyl alcohol. 
Samples from Iran were more toxic than samples from Bhutan. Jäger, Hafner, Welsch, Schneider, Iznaguen, Westendorf: The mutagenic potential  o f madder root in                                                  5 / 17 The root residues (pressed cake) after preparation of the boiling water extracts (RR, Tab. 3) 
were also extracted with ethyl acetate and ethyl alcohol. The mutagenicity of these samples 
was only moderately reduced compared to the extracts prepared from the original roots. The 
induction rates ranged between 4.3 and 8.8 (TA100 with S9 mix). Again samples from Iran 
resulted in higher induction rates. Toxicity observed with rooot extracts in TA100 without 
metabolic activation, masking mutagenic effects, dissappeared in the extracts of root residues.  
3.1.3 Mutagenicity of dyed wool 
Dyed wool was extracted with ethyl acetate, tap water, artificial acidic sweat (pH 5.0) and 
alkaline sweat (pH 8.0). As demonstrated in Tab. 4 ethyl acetate extracts of the wool dyed 
with madder root from Iran (DWI EtOAc) was mutagenic in strain TA100 with and without 
S9 mix. Wool extracts dyed with madder from Bhutan (DWB EtOAc) showed mutagenic 
effects only with metabolic activation. Wool extracts prepared neither with tap water (DW tw) 
nor with acidic sweat (DW AcS) showed a mutagenic response in the concentrations tested. 
Positive results were obtained with alkaline artificial sweat (DWI AlS) extracts from wool of 
origin Iran. 
3.2  Chemical analysis 
The anthraquinones (AQ) composition of the different samples prepared from madder roots 
was analysed. Fig. 2 shows chromatograms from extracts of unprocessed madder roots, from 
dyeing baths and from dyed wool of origin Bhutan and Iran. The ethyl acetate extracts of the 
roots show the typical pattern of AQ as described earlier by Westendorf et al. (1998). A 
glycosidic fraction containing the primverosides of alizarine and lucidine eluted with retention 
times of 8.9 and 9.3 minutes. Among the free aglycones lucidine (RT= 16.2), alizarine (RT = 
17.8), purpuroxanthine (RT = 21.8) and rubiadine (RT = 248) were clearly identifiable. Tab. 5 
presents the AQ concentrations calculated from the peak areas of the chromatograms shown 
in Fig. 2. Comparing the root extracts from Bhutan and Iran almost equal amounts of lucidine, 
and purpuroxanthine occurred, whereas alizarine concentration was almost five-fold higher in 
madder roots from Iran. Only small amounts of purpuroxanthine occurred in the root extracts 
of both origins. The extracts from the dyeing baths and the dyed wool reflected the AQ 
composition of the root extracts. In the wool dyed with root extracts from origin Iran the 
alizarine concentration is almost 26-fold higher than in samples dyed with roots from origin 
Bhutan. On the other hand with the dyeing baths AQ concentrations were higher in the 
samples from Bhutan origin. The concentration of rubiadine was higher in all samples from 
madder root of origin Bhutan than in the samples from Iran. 
Lucidine, because of its toxicological profile, is the most critical AQ present in madder roots 
and the only AQ being mutagenic in Salmonella  strain TA100. Therefore, the number of 
revertants obtained in the Salmonella  mutagenicity assay with strain TA100 was correlated 
with the lucidine concentration for all extracts representing the whole dyeing process. Fig. 3 
illustrates the significant positive correlation between the lucidine concentration of the pooled Jäger, Hafner, Welsch, Schneider, Iznaguen, Westendorf: The mutagenic potential  o f madder root in                                                  6 / 17 samples and the revertants induced in the strain TA100. A maximum induction rate of 8-10 
was achieved with a lucidine concentration of 700 µg/ml approximately. Higher 
concentrations were toxic. 
4 Discussion 
Synthetic and natural AQ are an important group of dyes used to dye textiles and foodstuff. 
Although many AQ are mutagenic in the Salmonella /microsome assay, very few are 
genotoxic in mammalian systems (Brown & Dietrich 1976; Westendorf et al. 1990, Kawasaki 
1992, Tanaka 2000). Among the AQ present in madder root, a traditional natural dyestuff, 
lucidine, rubiadine and purpuroxanthine are mutagenic in bacteria and mammalian cells. It 
could be demonstrated that lucidine is able to form DNA adducts in vitro  and in vivo  
(Poginsky et al. 1989). ACI rats receiving a diet containing 1% or 10% madder root showed 
an increase of the incidence of benign and malignant tumours in liver and kidneys 
(Westendorf et al., 1998). The tumour incidence was related to the concentration of lucidine-
DNA adducts in these organs. Because of the genotoxic potential of several AQ present in 
madder root and lucidine in particular, its contact with humans is of concern. It was, therefore 
of interest, to follow these compounds during the dyeing process from the preparation of the 
dyeing bathes to the dyed wool. Analysis of two different madder samples used in the dyeing 
industry (origin Iran and Bhutan) showed significant differences in the composition of AQ.  
The sample of Iran contained mostly alizarine. This AQ is most important for the dyeing 
process and is of low toxicity. Lucidine is the most critical AQ present in madder roots and 
the only AQ being mutagenic in Salmonella  strain TA100. The lucidine concentration in the 
different samples was therefore given special consideration.  
Significant mutagenic effects could be detected in the different madder root extracts and even 
in the final product, the dyed wool. In all samples lucidine could be detected. Especially the 
root extracts contained lucidine concentrations in the mg/ml range followed by the aqueous 
boiling root extracts No. 2 (AE2). An increase of the mutation rate with increasing lucidine 
concentrations was observable. Also the alizarine concentration in the dyeing bath which is 
the main dye component (Derksen, et al. 2003), correlates positively with the lucidine 
concentration, which is responsible for the unwanted mutagenic effect. Above all, the 
demonstration of the mutagenic potential in the extracts from dyed wool indicates that in the 
dyeing of textiles with madder root a potential risk for dye house workers and consumers 
must be assumed. Following the precautionary principle it is recommended that extracts of 
Rubia tinctorum  should not be used for textile dyeing any more.
