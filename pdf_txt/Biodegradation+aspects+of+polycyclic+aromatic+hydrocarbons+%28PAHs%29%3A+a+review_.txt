Abstract   13 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large group of chemicals . Their sources can 14 
be either  natural or anthropogenic. They represent an important concern due to their  15 
widespread distribution in the environment, their resistance to biodegradation, their potential 16 
to bioaccumulate and their harmful effects . In fact, natural resources polluted with PAHs 17 
usually lead to  mutagenic and carcinogenic impact s in fresh -water, marine- water and 18 
terrestrial species . Several pilot treatments have been implemented to prevent further  19 
economic consequences and deterioration of soil and water quality. As a promising option, 20 
fungal enzymes are regarded as a powerful choice for potential degradat ion of PAHs . Their 21 
rate of d egradation depends  on many factors , such as environmental conditions, fungal strain, 22 
nature of the fungal enzyme  and nature and chemical structure of the PAH  among others . 23 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Pleurotus ostreatus and Bjerkandera adusta are most 24 
commonly  used for the degradation  of such compounds  due to their production of  ligninolytic 25 
enzymes as lignin peroxidas e, manganese peroxidase and laccase.  The r ate of biodegradation 26 
depends on many culture conditions , such as temperature, oxygen, accessibility of nutrients  27 
and agitated or shallow culture . Moreover, the a ddition of  biosurfactant s can strongly modify 28 
the enzyme activity. The removal of PAHs is dependent on the ionization potential. The study 29 
of the kinetics is not completely comprehended, and it becomes more challenging when fungi 30 2 
 are applied for bioremediation. D egradation studies in soil are much more c omplicated than 31 
liquid cultures because of the heterogeneity  of soil, thus, many factors should be considered 32 
when studying soil bioremediation, such as desorption and bioavailability of PAHs. Different 33 
degradation pathways can be suggested . The peroxidases are heme -containing enzymes 34 
having common catalytic cycles.  One molecule of hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the resting 35 
enzyme withdrawing two electrons. Subsequently , the peroxidase is reduced back in two steps 36 
of one electron oxidation. Laccas es are copper -containing oxidases. They reduce molecular 37 
oxygen to water and oxidize phenolic compounds.  38

 1 Introduction  65 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or polyarene s, are a large group of chemicals with 66 
two or more fused aromatic rings in linear, angular or clustered arrangements . PAHs with less 67 
than six aromatic rings are often denominated as small PAHs and those containing more than 68 
six aromatic rings are often cal led large PAHs  (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009) . They  occur as 69 
colorless, white/pale yellow solids with low solubility in water, high melting and boiling 70 
points and low er vapour pressure as seen in Table 1. With an increase in molecular weight, 71 
their solubility in water decreases; melting and boiling point increases and vapour pressure 72 
decreases (Patnaik, 2007) .  73 
The widespread occurrence of PAHs is due to their generation  from the incomplete 74 
combustion or pyrolysis of numerous organic materials , such as coal, oil, petroleum gas, and 75 
wood. PAHs exhibit the most structural variety in nature compared to any other class of non- 76 
halogenated molecules in the eco - and biosphere. Moreover, with continued oil production 77 
and tran sport , the quantities of these hydrocarbons in water and sediment will keep increasing  78 
(Arun et al., 2008) . Fate of PAHs in the environment includes volatilization, photo -oxidation, 79 
chemical oxidation, adsorption on soil particles and leaching  (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009) . 80 
They are difficult to degrade in natural matrices  and their persistence increases with their  81 
molecular weight. Therefore, these compounds  represent an important concern due to their 82 
widespread presence in the environment, their resistance towards biodegr adation, their 83 
potential to bio -accumulate and their mutagenic and carcinogenic effects  that occurs by 84 
breathing air containing PAHs in the workplace, or by coming in contact with air, water, or 85 
soil near hazardous waste sites, or by  drinking contaminated water or  milk etc. (Lei et al., 86 
2007; Albanese et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014a; Zhao et al., 2014) . 87 
Potential treatments have been implemented to prevent further economic consequences and 88 
deterioration of soil and water quality. Amo ng such treatments, bioremediation initiatives 89 
promise to deliver long lasting and low cost solutions  for PAHs degradation. Biodegradation 90 
of hydrocarbons was carried out  either by bacteria (Cybulski et al., 2003; Arulazhagan and 91 
Vasudevan, 2011; Mao et al ., 2012; Hamamura et al., 2013;  Sun et al., 2014; Cébron et al., 92 
2015; Darmawan et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2015; Okai et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2015) , fungi  93 
(K. G. Wunch et al., 1999; Li et al., 2005; Chan et al., 2006; Elisabet Aranda, 2009; 94 
Hadibarata et al., 2009; Hadibarata and Kristanti, 2014; Bonugli -Santos et al., 2015; Cébron 95 
et al., 2015; Jové et al., 2015; Marco -Urrea et al., 2015; Mineki et al., 2015; Simister et al., 96 4 
 2015; Young et al., 2015)  or algae (Chan et al., 2006; Diaz et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014) . As a 97 
result  of such a large experience, the f ungi emerge as a powerful choice for degradation of 98 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons. They have advantages over  bacteria due to their capability to 99 
grow on a large spectrum of substrates and at the same time, they produce  extracellular 100 
hydrolytic enzymes, which can penetrate the polluted soil and remove the hydrocarbons  101 
(Balaji and Ebenezer, 2008; Messias et al., 2009; Venkatesagowda et al., 2012) .  102 
The rate of bioremediation of a pollutant depends  on the environmental conditions, type of 103 
microorganism,  as well as the  nature and chemical structure of the compound to be remove d. 104 
Therefore, to develop a bioremediation process, a number of factors are to be taken into 105 
account . The level and rate of biodegradation of PAHs by fungal enzymes relies upon growth 106 
factors , such as, oxygen, accessibility of nutrients, and enzyme optimum conditions like pH, 107 
temperature, chemical structure of the compound, cellular transport properties, and chemical 108 
partitioning in growth medium (Singh and Ward, 2004).  109 
Enzymatic biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by fungal  strains  have not 110 
been significantly  review ed, to the best of our knowledge . The main objective of the present 111 
review  is to understand the enzymatic biodegradati on of PAHs using fungal strains . In this 112 
sense, rate and pathways of biodegradation of PAHs are  strongly related to the environmental 113 
conditions  for the enzymatic activity and also for the fungal growth., It is also dependent on 114 
the system where the degradation takes place either ex -situ or in -situ, and on the nature and 115 
chemical structure of the po llutant. Also , the mechanisms of enzymes degrading PAHs should 116 
be highlighted. Therefore, to build a complete scenario of enzymatic fungal bioremediation 117 
many factors need to be considered  at the time .  118 
2 Fungal enzymes  119 
Davis et al., (1993)  demonstrated that  all fungi have  innate efficiency to degrade PAHs . 120 
Ligninolytic fungi have  been exten sively studied  for the past  few years (Haritash and 121 
Kaushik, 2009)  because they  produce ext racellular enzymes with extremely  reduced substrate 122 
specificity . This evolved due to the  irregular structure of lignin  but resulted in the ability to 123 
also degrade and mineralize various  organopollutants  (Hatakka, 1994; Vyas et al., 1994a; 124 
Hammel, 1995) . Latest research showed that extracellular peroxidases of these fungi are 125 
responsible for the initial oxidation of PAHs (Acevedo et al., 2011; Betts, 2012; Li et al., 126 
2014; Zhang et al., 2015) . Fungal lignin peroxidases oxidize a number of PAHs directly, 127 
while fungal manganese peroxidases co -oxidize them indirectly through enzyme -mediated 128 5 
 lignin  peroxidation. (Vyas et al., 1994a)  have tested several white rot fungi and suggested that 129 
all of them oxidize anthracene to anthraquinone. The ligninolytic system co ntain s three 130 
principal enzyme  groups, i.e. lignin peroxidase  (LiP), Mn -dependent peroxidase (MnP) , 131 
phenol  oxidase (laccase, tyrosinase), and H 2O2 producing enzymes  (Novotný et al., 2004a) . 132 
Ligninolysis is oxidative, it is induced by high oxygen ranges in the culture medium, and is 133 
part of the organism secondary metabolism; it is expressed under nutrient  limiting conditions , 134 
generally nitrogen  (Haemmerli et al., 1986; Hammel et al., 1986; Sanglard et al., 1986; 135 
Novotný et al., 2004a)  and their physiology has been broadly studied. Thus, there  is an  136 
elaborated comprehension of the ligninolytic mechanisms of basidiomycete s (Hatakka, 1994; 137 
Thurston, 1994) . Novotný et al., (2004b)  studied the  degradation  amounts and enzymatic 138 
activities of MnP, LiP and laccase in different species of ligninolytic fungi cultivated in liquid 139 
medium and soil and their impact on some xenobiotics including PAHs. They  show ed that 140 
degradation of anthracene and pyrene in spiked soil by Phanerochaete chrysosporium , 141 
Trametes versicolor a nd Pleurotus ostreatus depends  on the  MnP and laccase levels secreted 142 
into the soil.  Thus, fungal degradation of PAHs is not as fast or effective as bacteria, but they 143 
are very non -specific and have the capability to hydroxylate a large variety of xenobiotic s. 144 
Furthermore, many fungi are naturally living in soil litter and could grow into the soil and 145 
propagate  through the solid matrix to remove the PAHs. These criteria make the ecological 146 
role of ligninolytic fungi in bioremediation (Lee et al., 20 14; Winquist et al., 2014; Kristanti 147 
and Hadibarata, 2015; Lee et al., 2015) . In addition to MnP, LiP and laccase other fungal 148 
enzymes , such as Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, epoxide hydrolases, lipases, protease s 149 
and dioxygenases have been extensively studied for their ability to degrade PAHs (Bezalel et 150 
al., 1997; Balaji et al., 2014).  151 
3 Different species of fung us enzyme- degrading PAHs   152 
Since the effectiveness of bioremediation depends on the selection of species with matching 153 
properties , a vast range of fungi have been investigated for their capability to metabolize 154 
PAHs up to six rings  and the metabolite secretion is strain -dependent. In fact, as reported by 155 
Pothuluri et al., (1992) , Cunninghamella elegans degraded acenaphtene to its corresponding 156 
metabolites : 1-acenaphthenone,  1,2 -acenaphthenedione,  cis-1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthene,  157 
trans -1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthene,  1,5 -dihydroxyacenaphthene,  6 -hydroxyacenaphthenone , 158 
also anthracene  is degraded to a nthracene trans -1,2-dihydrodiol 1-anthrol, 9,10- 159 
anthraquinone, phthalate, glucuronide, sulfate and xyloside conjugates of hydroxylated 160 
intermediates using the strains: Bjerkandera sp, Cunninghamella elegans, Naematoloma 161 6 
 frowardii, Phanerochaete  chrysosporium, Phanerochaete laevis, Pleurotus  ostreatus, 162 
Pleurotus sajor- caju, Ramaria sp, Rhizoctonia solani, Trametes versicolor (Cerniglia, 1982; 163 
Cerniglia and Yang, 1984; Bezalel et al., 1996; Johannes and Majcherczyk, 2000)  (Table 2 ).  164 
Recently, Jové et al., ( 2016)  have conducted a comparative study on degradation efficiency of 165 
anthracene by three ligninolytic white -rot fungi ( P.chrysosporium , Irpex lacteus  and 166 
P.ostreatus ) and three non -ligninolytic fungi, and have shown that P. chrysosporium  167 
exhibited higher degra dation efficiency of 40% compared to 38%  with Irpex lacteus  and less 168 
than 30%  of anthracene removal with  P. ostreatus . Balaji et al., (2014) studied the capability 169 
of different fungal strains to secrete extracellular enzymes, such as lipase, laccase, peroxidase 170 
and protease , PAHs contaminated soil solution was used as the unique carbon source. The 171 
best lipase production was observed in Penicillium  chrysogenum (112 U ml-1), followed by 172 
Lasiodiplodia theobromae  VBE1 (100 U ml-1). However , Colletotrichum gleosporioides  was 173 
unable to produce lipase enzyme during PAHs degradation, because of the toxic impact of 174 
PAHs in contaminated soil.  The best laccase production was observed in P. chrysogenum ( 79 175 
U ml-1) and Aspergillus fumigatus (73 U ml-1), while modera te peroxidase activity (52 U ml-1) 176 
was noticed in Mucor racemose and Rhizopus stolonifer . Similar  results were reported  by 177 
Venkatesagowda et al., ( 2012)  and Thiyagarajan et al., ( 2008)  with a highest lipase production 178 
of 108 U ml-1 observed by L. theobromae and peroxidase  production of 516 U ml-1 observed 179 
by Coprinus sp. The s tudies of Balaji and Ebenezer, (2008)  and Banu and Muthumary, (2005)  180 
revealed highest lipase production by  C. gleosporioidies  in solid -state fermentation. Lee et al., 181 
(2014)  investigated the efficiency of 150 taxonomically and physiologically diverse white rot 182 
fungi in a variety of biotechnological procedures, such as dye decolorization which  183 
corresponds to the beginning of lignin metabolism and is considered as a predi ction of its 184 
capability to remove recalcitrant organopollutants , such as PAHs (Antonella Anastasi, 2009; 185 
Barrasa et al., 2009), gallic acid reaction which can be carried out to rank the fungi by their 186 
capability to degrade the PAHs, ligninolytic enzymes, a nd tolerance to four different  PAHs : 187 
phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. All the fungi in this study produced three 188 
ligninolytic enzymes, LiP, MnP, and laccase. Nevertheless, since the ligninolytic enzyme 189 
activities of the fungi were analyz ed in a nitrogen- limited condition, higher  enzyme activity 190 
did not correlate with higher  efficiency in the dye decolorization and gallic acid tests.  191 
Moreover, marine- derived fungi such as Aureobasidium pullulans , Mucor sp. , Aspergillus  sp. 192 
AS 5 8, Pichia guilliermondii  M-30, Aspergillus niger  etc. can be considered as a source of 193 
enzymes of environmental interest. Bonugli -Santos et al., (2015)  has reported that these 194 
strains produce hydrolytic and/or oxidative enzymes , such as alginate, lyase, amylase, 195 7 
 cellulase, chitinase, glucosidase, inulinase, keratinase, ligninase, lipase, nuclease, phytase, 196 
protease, and xylanase. These enzymes have an optimal temperature from 35 to 70 °C, and an 197 
optimal pH from  3.0 to 11.0. For marine -derived fungal strains , salinity has to be  taken into 198 
account in screening and production.  199 
Almost all the fungi produce LiP, MnP and laccase but at different rates under the same 200 
culture conditions. As a result, the efficiency of enzymatic bioremediation is strongly 201 
dependent on the type of the fungal strain. Among all these  studied fungi displaying lignolytic 202 
activity , the white rot fungi  Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Pleurotus ostreatus and 203 
Bjerkandera adusta have been intensively studied  and have shown higher  potential to 204 
metabolize PAHs  (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009) . 205 
3.1 Phanerochaete chrysosporium  206 
The p otential of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  fungi for use in PAH s bioremediation was  207 
first reported by  Bumpus et al., (1985)  who stated that th is white -rot basidiomycete partly 208 
degraded benzo[a]pyrene to carbon dioxide. Accordingly, s everal studies have been carried 209 
out to degrade P AHs by P. chrysosporium  under ligninolytic, nutrient -sufficient, or other 210 
induced culture conditions by the ligninolytic extracellular enzymes or intracellular 211 
catabolism (Syed and Yadav, 2012; Gu et al., 2015)  Besides,  P. chrysosporium  was reported 212 
to be a potent candidate for P AHs degradation due to its special physiological  characteristics  213 
and active adsorption sites . In fact,  P .chrysosporium  can adsorb P AHs compound in its  214 
mycelial pellets owing to its abundant conjugated structures (C=C and aromatic components), 215 
numerous chemical groups ( –OH, –COO–, O –C=O, –NH2, CO–NH) and high carbon content 216 
(Gu et al., 2015) . In fact, the capability to degrade PAH was attributed to the g eneration of an 217 
extracellular lignin degrading enzyme (ligninase) throughout secondary metabolism  (Sanglard 218 
et al., 1986) . Studies on xenobiotic degradation by P. chrysosporium  implied  a non-specific 219 
battery of enzymes produced by this fungus t hat degrade s the lignin polymer as the main 220 
agent in pollutant metabolism. The key enzymatic constituents of the ligninolytic system of P. 221 
chrysosporium  are thought to be lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) 222 
(Bogan and Lamar, 1995a) . LiPs are ideal candidates to be the catalysts of preliminary PAH 223 
oxidation in P. chrysosporium , and for anthracene, which is a LiP substrate (Hammel et al., 224 
1992a) . Nevertheless, many of the organopollutants degraded by P. chrysosporium  are not 225 
LiP substrates . As an examp le, phenanthrene was initially found not to be a LiP substrate 226 
(Hammel et al., 1986) , but later was claimed to undergo degradation in nutrient limited  P. 227 
chrysospo rium cultures (Bumpus, 1989a) . P. chrysosporium  strains are also able to degrade a 228 8 
 large variety of PAHs even under nitrogen limiting conditions (Andreoni et al., 2004; Bumpus 229 
et al., 1985) . Bumpus, (1989) demonstrated  that P. chrysosporium  is able to cleave 70 to 230 
100% of at least 22 PAHs  by substrate disappearance. Most of them profuse in anthracene oil 231 
within a period of 27 days of incubation with nitrogen -limited cultures of th e fungus. 232 
Actually, the radiolabeled carbon of [14C]phenanthrene, which was the prevalent compound of 233 
this mixture, was oxidized to 14CO 2. Moreover, HPLC  experiments and mass balance analysis 234 
revealed the conversion of [14C]phenanthrene to more polar and water -soluble metabolites. 235 
These results were corroborated by other researcher s wh o have shown that besides 236 
[14C]phenanthrene degradation, this fungus is able to oxidize [14C]2-methylnaphthalene, 237 
[14C]biphenyl, and [14C]benzo[a]pyrene to 14CO 2 (Sanglard et al., 1986) . Lee et al., (2010) 238 
demonstrated the potential of two strains of Phanerochaete sordida (KUC8369, KUC8370) 239 
among seventy- nine screened white ro t strains to degrade considerably higher amount of 240 
phenanthrene and fluoranthene than the strains of P. chrysosporium  and have also proven that 241 
the strain KUC8369 was the best degrader of fluoranthene despite the fact that it produced 242 
lower  MnP than P. chrysosporium . Phenanthrene metabolism in ligninolytic P. 243 
chrysosporium  was different from the pathway of  most bacteria . The PAH was cleaved 244 
between positions 3 and 4, and also differ ed from the process in non -ligninolytic fungi and 245 
other eukaryotes, unable to cause PAH ring fission . In fact, the ligninolytic fungus, P. 246 
chrysosporium , oxidizes phenanthrene at its C -9 and C10 position to give 2,2'- diphenic acid 247 
as a ring cleavage product. On the other hand, the major site of enzymatic attack by most 248 
bacteria is at the C -3 and C -4 position of phenanthere . Also , P. chrysosporium, under non - 249 
ligninolytic conditions, metabolizes phenanthrene to phenols and trans -dihydrodiols. This 250 
observation proves that several enzymatic mechanisms may occur in P.chrysosporium  for the 251 
initial oxidative attack on PAHs  (Cerniglia and Yang, 1984) . 252 
The p otential o f P. chrysosporium  in PAHs degradation is regarded to their extracellular 253 
enzyme s. Therefore  LiP and MnP. LiPs are ideal candidates to be the catalysts of preliminary 254 
PAH oxidation in P. chrysosporium . Nevertheless, it is suggested that other LiP-independent 255 
mechanisms need to exist for the initial oxidation of PAH s which are not  lignin peroxidase 256 
substrates.  Also , different pathways for PAHs degradation by P. chrysosporium can be 257 
considered . 258 
3.2 Pleurotus ostreatus  259 9 
 P. ostreatus , considered as white -rot fungi has been well documented for its capacity to 260 
degrade P AHs (Bezalel et al., 1996, 1997; Tortella et al., 2015) . Bezalel et al., (1996) reported 261 
that the white rot fungi , P. ostreatus cleaves  a wide variety of PAHs, including phenanthrene, 262 
with small correlation between PAH degradation and extracellular laccase, manganese 263 
peroxidase, or manganese -independent peroxidase activities. The same author s demonstrated 264 
in a subsequent study that P. ost reatus  is able to metabolize phenanthrene to phenanthrene 265 
trans -9,10-dihydrodiol and 2,2’ -diphenic acid as well as mineralizing it to CO 2. The 266 
formation of phenanthrene trans -9R,10R -dihydrodiol, in which only one atom of oxygen 267 
originated from molecular oxygen, this indicates that P. ostreatus  initially oxidizes 268 
phenanthrene stereoselectively, via a cytochrome P -450 monooxygenase and an epoxide 269 
hydrolase rather than a dioxygenase  intervenes  to form the dihydrodiol  (Bezalel et al., 1997). 270 
Schützendübel et al ., (1999) studied the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 271 
(PAHs) with Pleurotus ostreatus in liquid cultures for the duration of 7 weeks. It removed 272 
43% and 60% of fluorene and anthracene after only 3 days of i ncubation. Phenanthrene, 273 
fluoranthe ne and pyrene were degraded uniformly during the 7 weeks but to a lower level  274 
than fluorene and anthracene, and their degradation rate reached a maximum of 15%. The 275 
removal of anthracene at a different rate than fluorene implies the synchronized existence of a 276 
minimum of two different degradation pathways. In this study , an addition of milled wood to 277 
the culture increased the secretion of MnP and laccase, but no increase in the degradation of 278 
PAHs was recorded. P ossibly , for MnP, this can be due t o the lack of H 2O2 during the 279 
secretion time which would inhibit the oxidation process (Field et al., 1992) . The same reason 280 
could explain the clear correlation between the degradation of PAHs and laccase activity since 281 
there is a limitation of co -substrates for the oxidation mediated by this enzyme.  282 
 283 
 284 
3.3 Bjerkandera adusta  285 
Other than Pleurotus ostreatus, Schützendübel et al., (1999)  investigated the degradation of 286 
phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, fluorene and anthracene  with Bjerkandera adusta in the 287 
same culture conditions. This fungus degraded 56% and 38% of fluorene and anthracene, 288 
while other PAHs w ere removed uniformly but to a lower rate . LiP and MnP activity was not 289 
detected during this oxidation and the ending quinones resulting  from this oxidation were not 290 
observed as final products  (Field et al., 1992) . These results suggest a new pathway than the 291 10 
 typical extracellular one s, as described for the removal of phenanthrene by Phanerochaete 292 
chrysosporium  (Sutherland et al., 1991)  and Pleurotus ostreatus (Lea Bezalel et al., 1996a) , 293 
and the higher oxidative potent ial produced in latter phase by these enzymes can increase 294 
PAHs degradation.  295 
Another study by Wang et al., (2002) investigated the usefulness of a chemically modified 296 
manganese peroxidase with cyanuric chloride -activated methoxypolyethylene glycol, 297 
produce d by Bjerkandera adusta. The modified and native enzymes demonstrated identical 298 
catalytic properties in the oxidation of Mn(II) and other substrates including veratryl alcohol, 299 
guaiacol, 2,6 -dimethoxylphenol, and 2,2 -azino -bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline -6-sulfonate). 300 
However, the modified enzyme exhibited higher level of resistance to denaturation by 301 
hydrogen peroxide and stability to organic solvents such as N,N -dimethylformamide, 302 
acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol and te trahydrofuran. Likewise, the modified enzyme 303 
demonstrated better stability to higher temperatures and lower pH than the native enzyme. 304 
The same author showed in later study that the oxidation rate of PAHs, such as anthracene, 305 
pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and PAH s with ionization potentials of 7.43 eV or lower, decreased in 306 
the presence of manganous ions in the purified manganese -lignin peroxidase (MnLiP) hybrid 307 
isoenzyme from Bjerkandera adusta. Therefore, chemical modification of manganese 308 
peroxidase from B. adusta  improved its e ffectiveness . 309 
4 Culture conditions  310 
Natural resources polluted with PAHs usually raise their mutagenic and carcinogenic impact 311 
in fresh -water, marine- water and terrestrial species. This leads to unfavorable conditions for 312 
growth of even i ndigenous microorganisms. To overcome this limitation and obtain the 313 
highest enzyme production, culture conditions and inducers should be optimized (Balaji et al., 314 
2014). Generally, microorganisms require suitable  growth conditions  (e.g. carbon source, 315 
nutrients, temperature, pH, redox potential and oxygen content which, strongly affect their 316 
growth (Adams et al., 2015). White rot fungi , in turn, appear to act because of their  ability to 317 
penetrate contaminated soils with their hyphae and the production o f extracellular oxidases 318 
(Wang et al., 2009). 319 
Hadibarata and Kristanti, ( 2014)  reached higher rates of degradation of n- eicosane by adding 320 
glucose as a carbon source for Trichoderma S019 strain. In this regard, the incubation time 321 
was found to be critical parameter influencing the degradation rate, for instance, Zafra et al., 322 
(2015b)  have found that Trichoderma asperellum  could degrade 74 % of phenanthrene, 63 % 323 11 
 of pyrene, and 81 %  of benzo[a]pyrene  after 14 days of incubation at concentration of 1000 324 
mg kg−1. Moreover,  Peniophora incarnata KUC8836 was able to degrade  up to 95.3 % of 325 
phenanthrene and 97.9 % of pyrene after 2 weeks of incubation (Lee et al., 2014)  and showed 326 
higher degradation rate of creosote at higher concentration of 229.49 mg kg−1 (Lee et al., 327 
2015) . Furthermore, the concentration of the contaminant represents a key point which 328 
influenced the degradation of PHAs. Zafra et al., ( 2015a)  have show n that the concentration 329 
of contaminant had  a selective pressure on hydrocarbon- degrading organisms,  and higher 330 
PAHs is a growth -limiting for microorganisms which developed a response against P AHs 331 
regarding cell membrane structure, mycelia pigmentation, and sporulation alterations . 332 
Likewise,  the growth of fungi is inhibited in highly contaminated soils and overall 333 
remediation by fungi is extremely slow, needing many days or even more than a  month as 334 
reported by  Drevinskas et al., ( 2016) . In this sense Balaji et al., (2014)  also tested different 335 
carbon sources for lipase production by P.  chrysogenum  and L. theobromae and cellulose in  336 
M. racemosus  and sucrose induced the highest activity in these species . Similarly, nitrogen 337 
sources have to be taken into account, yeast extract was found to be the best inducer of 338 
maximum lipase production in the mentioned strains . Dharmsthiti and Kuhasuntisuk, ( 1998) 339 
also demonstrated that yeast extract, as a supplemental source increased lipase production by 340 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa LP602 in lipid -rich wastewater treatment.  Moreover, Mineki et al., 341 
(2015)  investiga ted the degradation of PAHs with Trichoderma/Hypocrea  genus which use d 342 
pyrene as sole source of carbon, and found that the growth of the strain and pyrene -degrading 343 
activity was enhanced  to 27% and 24 -25% compared with the control after incubation for 7 344 
and 14 days, respectively, by adding 0.02% yeast extract, 0.1% sucrose, or 0.1% lactose.  345 
Garapati and Mishra, (2012) also reported the relevance of nutrients in biodegradation of 346 
hydrocarbon by a fungal strain  Ligninolytic enzymes can be regulated by aromatic 347 
compounds, such as different dyes and PAHs, that way fungi can use these aromatic 348 
compounds as unique source of carbon (Yang et al., 2011). In fact, it is unwise to test 349 
ligninolytic enzyme activity when screening species with highest PAH removal in t he absence 350 
of substrate as  the use of xenobiotic as substrates can induce the enzyme activity (Lee et al., 351 
2014). This technique is attainable for fungal species that produce ligninolytic enzymes with 352 
higher efficiency, such as Bjerkandera adusta KUC91 07 and Skeletocutis perennis  KUC8514 353 
for LiP production; Phanerochaete velutina KUC8366 and Phanerochaete sp. KUC9015 for 354 
MnP production; and Cerrena consors  KUC8416 and 8421 for laccase production (Moreira et 355 
al., 2006) . Hofrichter et al., (1998) , found that a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds was in 356 
part mineralized by the manganese peroxidase (MnP) system of the white rot fungus 357 12 
 Nematoloma frowardi  and that  mineralization was  enhanced by  peptide glutathione GSH (a 358 
natural peptide produced by eukaryotic cells which protects cells against reactive oxygen 359 
species and free radicals) and depended on the ratio of MnP activity to concentration of GSH.  360 
This suggests  that carbon and nitrogen are essential for enzyme activity and consequently 361 
affects PAHs degradation. Furthermore, PAHs themselves can be used as a substrate and at 362 
the same time , as a nutrient source for enzymes induc ing their activity reducing  costs of 363 
culturing . 364 
Simultaneously , the effect of different surfactants can affect PAHs removal. Balaji et al., 365 
(2014)  showed that lipase production was maximized  with Triton X -100 boosting  activit ies to 366 
68 U ml-1 in P. chrysogenum, 72 U ml-1 in M. racemosus and 62 U ml-1 in L. theobromae 367 
VBE1.  Also, Gopinath et al., (2013)  highlighted the relevance of surfactant in lipase 368 
production and its numerous applications. T he highest lipase activity by  Metarhizium 369 
anisopliae , occurs when Tween 80 and SDS were applied  (Ali et al., 2009) . Likewise, Chen et 370 
al., (2006) investigated the  effect of surfactants on PAHs degradation by white rot fungi in 371 
soil water system, and found that Triton X -100 and SDS restrained the removal of PAHs. 372 
Moreover, biosurfactants enhance the removal of  PAHs (Arun et al., 2008) . Thus, using 373 
surfactants is generally effective for the biodegradation process , but previous testing is needed 374 
to prevent the inhibition in some cases.  375 
Different temperatures were detected for optimal enzymes activity. Most of the enzymes have 376 
highest activity at mesophilic temperatures  and it declines  with very high and reduced 377 
temperatures. Several enzymes are claimed to be active even at extreme temperatures. A t a 378 
temperature of 5 °C, only the laccase activity is detected . The optimum temperature for 379 
laccase activity is 45 °C, but it declines  to 30% at 5 °C, and 31% at  75 °C. However , the 380 
activity of Mn -dependent peroxidase was  higher even at 75 °C (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009) . 381 
Farnet et al., ( 2000) have shown that the activity of fungus , Marasmius quercophilus  laccase 382 
was the highest at 80 °C. 383 
The extracellular enzyme release and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) removal in 384 
agitated and shallow stationary liquid cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  requires the 385 
addition of t wo inducers of lignin peroxidase (LiP) a nd manganese peroxidase (MnP) , veratryl 386 
alcohol and Tween -80, respectively  (Ding et al., 2008) . However, if s hallow stationary 387 
cultures are used, the y also produc e enzyme since it increased the contacting area between 388 
cells and oxygen without shear stress, while agitated cultures increased biodegradation rate by 389 
aiding interphase mass transfer of PAHs into aqueous phase. Simultaneously, they are 390 
recognized as inhibi tors to the production of ligninolytic enzymes due to shear stress on 391 13 
 mycelia. The use of a LiP stimulator, veratryl alcohol, did not increase PAH degradation but 392 
considerably improved LiP activity. In contrast, Tween -80 enhanced MnP secretion and PAH 393 
degradation in shallow stationary cultures. On the other side, high PAH degradation was 394 
noticed in agitated cultures in the absence of apparent LiP and MnP activities . Same results 395 
were proved by Schützendübel et al., ( 1999) , who mentioned that degradation of fluorene, 396 
anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene are not associated with the production of 397 
extracellular enzymes by Pleurotus ostreatus  and Bjerkandera adusta. Similar results were 398 
described by Lea Bezalel et al., ( 1996a ) et Verdin et al., ( 2004)  who found degradation of 399 
PAH in fungal cultures in the absence of LiP and MnP activities. Mohammadi et al., (2009)  400 
have also tested the effect of the incubation mode on anthracene biodegradation and it was 401 
revealed that the culture agitation clearly incr eased the biodegradation capacity of bagasse 402 
immobilized fungal cells despite the repressive effect of culture agitation on the ligninase 403 
activity.  404 
All these outcomes indicated that extracellular peroxidase activities are not directly associated 405 
with the PAH degradation, and the increased solubility may be essential in the enhancement 406 
of PAH degradation rather than enzyme activity and hence suggest ed the possibility of 407 
producing other oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes that were not analyzed but could probably 408 
have degraded PAHs. Another suggestion is the PAHs degrading role of intracellular 409 
enzymes, such as tyrosinases and dioxygenases secreted into the culture filtrate by different 410 
fungi (Milstein et al., 1983) . 411 
Enzyme immobilization a llows an alternat ive procedure that enables an increase in the steady 412 
state of enzymes and significant environmental tolerance. Immobilized enzyme, which can be 413 
established by several methods, such as adsorption, entrapment, and covalent bonding based 414 
on chemical/physical mechanisms, has enahnced  activity and stability. The immobilized 415 
enzyme can withstand a wider range of temperatures and pH, as well as significant substrate 416 
concentration changes; this makes the complex much more resistant to severe environments 417 
(Dodor et al., 2004). This results in a longer lifetime and higher productivity per active unit of 418 
enzyme. Immobilization enables the enzyme to be recycled, and such an approach is much 419 
better suited for hydrophobic PAHs -contaminated soil bioremediation (Chang et al., 2015). 420 
5 Ionization potential   421 
Bogan and Lamar, (1995a)  defined the behavior of intact fungus and the MnP -based lipid 422 
peroxidation system with respect to a larger variety of creosote PAHs. The disappearance of 423 
three-  to six -ring creosote PAH components from intact fungal cultures and throughout lipid 424 14 
 peroxidat ion in vitro was reported. In each of these cases, the approach is shown to be mainly 425 
dependent on IP, indicating that the contribution of one or more than one electron oxidants is 426 
included over the entire range of PAHs tested. One-electron oxidation of PA Hs occurs by 427 
peroxidases (IP≤7.35 eV), Mn dependent peroxidase (IP≤8.19 eV), ligninase (IP≤7.55 eV) 428 
and laccase (IP≤7.45 eV) (Cavalieri et al., 1983) . The IP values, referring to the energy 429 
needed to eliminate an electron and to form a cation radical are 8 .12 for naphthalene, 8.03 for 430 
phenanthrene, 7.21 for benzo(a)pyrene, and 7.31 for benzo(g,h,i)perylene (Table 1)  (Cavalieri 431 
et al., 1983) . PAHs like benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, and anthracene, that have ionization 432 
potential <7.35 eV, are LiP substrates, whe reas PAHs, such as phenanthrene and 433 
benzo[e]pyrene that have ionization potentials >7.35 eV, cannot be LiP substrates. The 434 
products of the enzymatic oxidation are PAH quinones. For example, benzo[a]pyrene is 435 
oxidized to its 1,6 -, 3,6- , and 6,12 -quinones, pyrene to its 1,6-  and 1,8- quinones, and 436 
anthracene to 9,10 -anthraquinone (Hammel, 1995) . Vyas et al., ( 1994a)  has suggested that P. 437 
ostreatus and T. versicolor  produce enzyme(s) other than lignin peroxidase capable of 438 
oxidizing compounds with higher ioniza tion potential, such as anthracene.  439 
6 Kinetics  440 
The characteristics of the soil determine the diversity and activity of its microflora which is 441 
responsible for the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  and any other compound. 442 
In addition, soil characteristics influence the strength of interactions between the PAHs and 443 
individual soil compounds. Cutright, (1995)  indicated that Cunninghamella echinulata var. 444 
elegans  efficient ly degrades PAHs in the presence of these nutrients w hile any other 445 
indigenous microorganisms are not . Moreover, for a first -order reaction system, the rate of 446 
change in contaminant concentration is proportional to the contaminant concentration in the 447 
soil and time prediction tool in degradation depends on the microorganism, the contaminant 448 
type and its concentration. 449 
The prediction of time for bioremediation of polluted soil is based mostly on the 450 
microorganisms, pollutant type and its concentration. Furthermore, the improvement of more 451 
appropriate kinetic model needs the monitoring of biomass, respiration studies, and 452 
investigation of interactions of different organisms. Although bioremediation has a larger rate 453 
of success  than synthetic methods , still the kinetics is not completely understood, and the 454 
kinetics becomes more challenging when fungi are applied for biorem ediation (Haritash and 455 
Kaushik, 2009) . As described previously, the different enzymes involved in fungal 456 15 
 degradation have maximum activity at different temperatures and some of them are active 457 
even at extreme temperatures. Therefore, monitoring the kinetic s for various fungal strains is 458 
complicated , but most of them have good degradation capacities in a mesophilic range. The 459 
degradation rate can be improved by pretreatment at a high temperature which results in 460 
volatilization and decrease in the soil–water partition coefficient, as a result dissolution of 461 
pollutants increases the degradation rate.  462 
7 Soil and liquid cultures  463 
Most research studies on the extracellular enzyme activity produced by fungi have primarily 464 
been focusing on experiments in liquid culture (Ruiz -Dueñas et al., 1999; Kwang Ho Lee, 465 
2004; Eibes et al., 2006a; Rodrigues et al., 2008; Mäkelä et al., 2009; Dashtban et al., 2010) . 466 
Nevertheless , some  interest has been given to the changes of the enzymes  produced by fungal 467 
strains during PAHs degradation in different soil types  (Wang et al., 2009) . When fungi get 468 
into non- sterile soil, they must compete with indige nous soil microbes for nutrients and the 469 
mycelia  of the fungi may be affected. As a consequence, the production of enzymes may be 470 
influenced by more complicated elements  (McErlean et al. , 2006; Wang et al., 2014a ).  471 
Boyle et al., (1998) showed that w hite rot fungi growing in soil presented  low amounts of 472 
degraded  polyaromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs ), even though they did degrade some other 473 
organopollutants. Nevertheless , in liquid culture , they degraded several PAHs . The latter  474 
interpretation was supported by Novotný et al., (2004b)  who have demonstrated  that the 475 
importance of higher  fungal enzyme levels for effective degradation of recalcitrant 476 
compounds  was better revealed in liquid media in comparison to the same strains growing in 477 
soil. Liquid culture reports have documented the degradation and/or mineralization of an 478 
extensive range of PAHs  with phenanthrene, fluor ene, benzofluorene, anthracene, 479 
fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene , among them (Bogan and 480 
Lamar, 19 95a).  481 
PAHs existing in soil are largely differentiated because of the high er heterogeneity of the soil 482 
structure (Li et al., 2007) . Furthermore , the forms of the sorbed contaminants in soils are an 483 
essential element that affects  the degradation (Yang et al., 2009) . A significant spectrum of 484 
PAHs is biodegradable in aqueous culture but they are not biodegradable in soil . This fraction 485 
is classified as persistent residue with highly reduced bioavailability (Cornelissen et al., 486 
2005) .  487 16 
 PAHs molecules can be divided into three categories considering the desorption and 488 
bioavailability: easily desorbing and available fraction; the hardly desorbing and available 489 
fraction; and the irreversible and completely unavailable fraction (Li et al., 2007) . Therefore, 490 
at th e beginning of degradation, PAHs are quickly desorbed, and the  desorption could 491 
possibly not present a limitation for biodegradation. The sorbed forms or the bioavailability of 492 
a contaminant are controlled by the characteristics of the contaminant and the soil, along with 493 
the contact time between the contaminant and the soil (Wang et al., 2014b) .  494 
Wang et al., (2009)  observed a degradation of phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene in 495 
soils by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The highest activity of LiP and MnP reached  1.92 U 496 
g-1. Their high molecular size with high er ring number, reduced aqueous solubility and large 497 
octanol/water partition coefficient (K ow) of the se compounds, makes them firmly combined 498 
and entrapped in soil micropores or soil organic matter ( SOM ) matrix. This result s in the  499 
limitation on their biodegradability by enzyme s. Huesemann et al., (2003)  confirmed that the 500 
low rates of PAHs biodegradation were  due to their low bioavailability in soil and low mass 501 
transfer rate of hydrophobic organic contaminants to the aqueous phase rather than deficiency 502 
in microorganisms degrading them. Furthermore  Wang et al., (2009)  also demonstrated that 503 
the degradation of pyrene by P. chrysosporium  decreased w ith increasing SOM  conten t, 504 
confirming  that the SOM content can negatively affect the bioavailability of PAHs (Gill and 505 
Arora, 2003) . While the maximum of LiP and MnP activities increased .  506 
Also sorption of  contaminants makes them less bioavailable with elevated contact time 507 
(aging) in the soil (Antizar -Ladislao et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008) . The decrease in 508 
bioavailability induced by aging fluctuate s with the contaminants and soils  and the 509 
mechanisms are still to be investigated in deep  (Northcott and Jones, 2001; Nam and Kim, 510 
2002; Watanabe et al., 2005) . Some studies suggested that the contaminant s are slowly 511 
transported from  easily desorbing and bioavailable  sites to hardly desorbing and less 512 
bioavailable sites  where they accumulate throughout aging, and even to irreversible and non - 513 
bioavailable sites, which leads to reduced decontamination rates (Northcott and Jones, 2001; 514 
Sun et al., 2008) . 515 
Furthermore, sterilization of the soil is typically employed when investigating biodegradation 516 
in laboratory experiments to ensure that the degradation capability is high. This situation is 517 
not applied in bioremediation field. Few studies have described th e effects of soil sterilization 518 
on the bioavailability of sorbed contaminants and changes in SOM (Northcott and Jones, 519 
2001; Nam et al., 2003; Kelsey et al., 2010) . Wang et al., (2014)  observed that sterilization 520 17 
 increased the degradation of pyrene because of the removal of competition from indigenous 521 
microbes.  522 
 523 
8 Degradation Pathways  524 
An understanding of the process for PAHs degradation in fungal strains would be a crucial 525 
step in the clarification of the enzymatic mechanisms.  Ligninol ytic enzymes undergo a one 526 
electron radical oxidation, producing aryl cation radicals from contaminants followed by 527 
generation of quinones (Vyas et al., 1994b; Cerniglia, 1997a) . As an example,  the intact 528 
culture of P. chrysosporium  degraded anthracene to anthraquinone  (Hammel et al., 1991) . 529 
Anthraquinone was further degraded to phthalic acid and carbon dioxide. Purified forms of 530 
lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase likewise were able to oxidize anthracene, 531 
pyrene, fluorene and benzo[a]pyrene to the corresponding quinones (Haemmerli et al., 1986; 532 
Hammel et al., 1986, 1991; Hammel, 1992; Bogan and Lamar, 1996)  (Figure 1) . 533 
Also, t he crude and the purified ligninase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium oxidize the 534 
benzo(a)pyrene into three soluble  organic  compounds, which a re benzo(a)pyren e 1,6 -, 3,6-, 535 
and 6,12 -quinones  (Haemmerli et al., 1986) . These fact s support the suggestion that lignin - 536 
degrading enzymes were  peroxidases, mediating oxidation of aromatic compounds through 537 
aryl cation radicals. The ligninase which was unstable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide 538 
could be stabilized by inclusion of veratryl alcohol to the reaction mixture. The oxidation of 539 
benzo (a)pyrene was stimulated  by this alcohol. Likewise , Hammel et al., (1986)  studied the 540 
oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dibenzo[p] -dioxins and found that the 541 
lignin peroxidase (ligninase) of P . chrysosporium  catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of 542 
lignin -related compounds . Tests with pyrene as the substrate revealed that pyrene -1,6-dione 543 
and pyrene -1,8-dione are the main oxidation products (84% of total as determined by high 544 
performance liquid chromatograph y), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of 545 
ligninase -catalyzed pyrene oxidations executed in the presence of H 2O revealed that quinone 546 
oxygens occur from water. W hole cultures of P. chrysosporium  oxidize d pyrene to these 547 
quinones  in transient step. Experiments with dibenzo[p]dioxin and 2 -chlorodibenzo[p]dioxin 548 
revealed that they are also substrates for ligninase. The immediate product of 549 
dibenzo[p]dioxin oxidation was the dibenzo[p]dioxin cation radical, which was noticed in 550 
enzymatic reaction s by its electron spin resonance and apparent absorption spectra. The cation 551 
radical mechanism of ligninase thus  was applied besides lignin, to other environmentally 552 
important aromatics.  Hammel, (1992) also studied the oxidation pathway of phenanthrene and 553 18 
 phenanthrene -9,10-quinone (PQ) by the ligninolytic fungus , Phanerochaete chrysosporium  at 554 
their C -9 and C -10 positions to result in  a ring -fission product, 2,2' -diphenic acid (DPA), 555 
which was identified in chromatographic and isotope dilution experiments . DPA formation 556 
from phenanthrene was relatively higher in reduced nitrogen (ligninolytic) cultures than in 557 
high-nitrogen (non -ligninolytic) cultures and was not present  in uninoculated cultures. The 558 
oxidation of PQ to DPA included both fungal and abiotic process, and was not affected by the 559 
amount of nitrogen added, and cleaved rapidly than phenanthrene to DPA. Phenanthrene - 560 
trans -9,10-dihydrodiol, which was earlier shown to be the major phenanthrene metabolite in 561 
non-ligninolytic P. chrysosporium  cultures,  was not formed in the ligninolytic cultures. 562 
Therefore,  phenanthrene degradation by ligninolytic P. chrysosporium  proceeded in sequence 563 
from phenanthrene to PQ and then to DPA, involving both ligninolytic and non -ligninolytic 564 
enzymes, and is not initiated  by a common microsomal cytochrome P -450. The extracellular 565 
lignin peroxidases of P. chrysosporium  were not able to oxidize phenanthrene in vitro  and 566 
consequently were also less likely to catalyze the first step of phenanthrene degradation in 567 
vivo. Both phenanthrene and PQ were mineralized to identical range by the fungus, which 568 
supported the intermediacy of PQ in phenanthrene degradation, but both compounds were 569 
mineralized considerably less than the structurally associated lignin peroxidase subst rate 570 
pyrene. Hammel et al., ( 1991)  reported that Phanerochaete  was generally different from the 571 
bacteria, which proceed ed through AC cis -1,2-dihydrodiol instead of AQ and has been 572 
suggested to yield salicylate rather than phthalate as a monocyclic cleavage product. The 573 
formation of quinone to prepare the aromatic ring for cleavage is an uncommon 574 
biodegradation approach and was showed  to be of general significance in P. chrysosporium . 575 
LiPs have also been involved  in the degradation of polychlorinated phenols  by this organism.  576 
The monooxygenase system of cytochrom e P-450 producing epoxides can also be included in 577 
degradation of PAHs. The epoxides can be rearranged into hydroxyl derivatives or  can be 578 
hydrolyzed to vicinal dihydrodiols. Ligninolytic fungus , Irpex lacteus  degraded anthracene 579 
and phenanthrene and the main degradation products were anthraquinone and phenanthrene - 580 
9,10- dihydrodiol, respectively as shown in F igure 2. The study also suggested the degradation 581 
pathway of anthracene and phenanthrene (C ajthaml et al., 2002) . Thus , several systems are 582 
involved in the degradation of PAHs with fungal enzymes including intracellular cytochrome 583 
P450 and extracellular lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase.  584 
The biodegradation of PAHs was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Fungal 585 
strains were grown on PAHs under static aerobic conditions for 6 and 10 days. The highest 586 19 
 degradation of naphthalene (69%) was performed by a strain that had MnP activity, followed 587 
by strain that showed lignin peroxidase and laccase activities. Likewise, it was found that 588 
highest degradation of phenanthrene (12%) was observed with the strain that contained MnP 589 
and laccase activities  (Clemente et al., 2001) . Soil fungi Aspergillus sp., Trichocladium 590 
canadense , and Fusarium oxysporum  degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons low - 591 
molecular -weight PAHs (2 -3 rings) and produce ligninolytic enzymes also  under 592 
microaerobic and highly reduced oxygen conditions , but  ligninolytic enzyme activities can 593 
vary among fungi a nd PAHs . Under microaerobic conditions, the 3 species  demonstrated at 594 
least one of the assayed ligninolytic activities (LiP, MnP, laccase). In contrast, under very - 595 
low-oxygen conditions, ligninolytic enzyme activity was frequently not observed (Silva et al., 596 
2009) . 597 
Marco -Urrea et al., (2015) , described the biodegradation pathways of PAHs using non - 598 
ligninolytic fungi. These non -ligninolytic strains showed a particular type of resistance to 599 
different amounts of PAHs. The most common mechanism of PAHs transf ormation is the 600 
intracellular accumulation followed by the degradation, akin to benzo[a]pyrene degradation 601 
using intracellular enzymes of the strain Fusarium solani  (Fayeulle et al., 2014) . Likewise,  602 
extracellular enzymes , such as laccase, can also be produced by some of these non- 603 
ligninolytic fungi. but they are not as effective as intracellular enzymes degrading PAHs. The 604 
phase I of degradation pathway includes the formation of oxidized metabolites , such as 605 
hydroxyl -, dihydroxy- , dihydrodiol - and quinone -derivatives followed by the phase II which 606 
includes the conjugation with sulfate -, methyl -, glucose -, xylose - or glucuronic acid groups. 607 
These metabolites are less harmful than the original PAHs (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2010) .  608 
9 Mechani sm of degradation  with  enzymes   609 
9.1 C haracteristics  of ligninolytic enzymes  610 
9.1.1 Characteristics of peroxidases  611 
A couple of extracellular oxidative enzymes are responsible for lignin degradation: 612 
peroxidases and laccases (phenol oxidases). Both peroxidases were initially found in P. 613 
chrysosporium  (Tien and Kirk, 1983) . A number of other fungi also possess these enzy mes, 614 
while others have either one or the other (Mester and Tien, 2000) . In the majority of species, 615 
peroxidases are generally recognized to be families of isozymes occurring as extracellular 616 
glycosylated proteins which may enhance their stability (Thurston, 1994) . The ratio between 617 20 
 the isozymes varies with the culture age and the culture conditions (Leisola et al., 1987; 618 
Bogan and Lamar, 1995b) . They need hydrogen peroxide to oxidize lignin and lignin -related 619 
compounds. Their molecular weights and isoelectric points range from 35 to 47 kDa and 2.8 620 
to 5.4 kDa, respectively (Leisola et al., 1987; Bogan and Lamar, 1995b; Johansson et al., 621 
2002) . The peroxidases are single heme -containing enzymes (protoporphyrin IX) so that the 622 
absorption spectrum of the native enzyme has a very particular absorbance maximum at 406 - 623 
409 nm (ten Have and Teunissen, 2001) . The peroxidases are divided into two different  types 624 
depending on their  different substrate spectra: manganese peroxidase (MnP), for which 625 
Mn(II) is best  reducing substrate and the lignin peroxidase (LiP). LiP oxidizes non -phenolic 626 
and phenolic aromatic compounds (ten Have and Teunissen, 2001) . 627 
9.1.2 Characteristics of laccase  628 
Laccase belongs to the copper oxidase family that is able to catalyze the oxidat ion of phenols, 629 
polyphenols and anilines, which are largely dispersed in higher plants, fungi and bacteria 630 
(Tavares et al., 2006) . The enzyme is typically larger than peroxidases, having a molecular 631 
weight around and above 60 kD and have acidic isoelectric  points (ten Have and Teunissen, 632 
2001) . As with other extracellular enzymes, laccases are glycosylated. As an alternative to 633 
H2O2, laccases use dioxygen as an oxidant, reducing it by four electrons to water. These types 634 
of enzymes have four copper per enzy me, that represents three different types, and 635 
consequently, every type has a different role in the oxidation of laccase substrates 636 
(Messerschmidt and Huber, 1990) . The type 1 copper is suggested to be included in the 637 
reaction with the substrates. It has an absorption maximum at the wavelength of 610 nm 638 
which gives the enzyme the typical blue color. The type 2 copper and the two type 3 coppers 639 
cluster in a triangular form which is involved in the binding and in the reduction of O 2 as well 640 
as the storage of  electrons coming from the reducing substrates. The type 2 copper does not 641 
present visible absorbance, while the type 3 coppers have an absorption maximum at 330 nm 642 
(Mester and Tien, 2000; ten Have and Teunissen, 2001) . It was demonstrated that, in the 643 
presence of suitable mediators, laccase is capable to oxidize a considerably larger range of 644 
compounds, such as PAHs (Peng et al., 2015) . 645 
9.1.3 Mediators of laccase Laccase has been well studied for its capacity to oxidize PAHs , 646 
xenobiotic  and phenolic lignin model compounds (Majcherczyk et al., 1998; Peng et al., 647 
2015) . Earlier , its application was limited  because of the low oxidation potential , thus, in the 648 
presence of an appropriate mediator ; laccases  show higher oxidation capability resulting in 649 21 
 numerous biotechnological applications involving oxidation of non- phenolic lignin 650 
compounds and detoxification of various environmental pollutants  (Upadhyay et al., 2016; 651 
Khambhaty et al., 2015) .  Recently, laccase has found applications in other sectors , such as in 652 
the design of biosensors and nanotechnology  (Li et al., 2014; Upadhyay et al., 2016) . Besides, 653 
they are used in the decolourization and detoxification of industrial effluents and the treatment 654 
of wastewater (Viswanath et al., 2014; Chandra and Chowdhary, 2015) . These mediators 655 
include 1 -hydrobenzotriazole (1 -HBT) (Majcherczyk et al., 1998a) , 2,2` -azino -bis-(3- 656 
ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (Bourbonnais et al., 1997) , and violuric acid 657 
(Xu et al., 2000) , but also natural mediators have been explored, such as phenol, aniline, 4 - 658 
hydroxybenzoic acid, 4- hydroxybenzyl alcohol (Johannes and Majcherczyk, 2000) , 3- 659 
hydroxyanthranilate (Eggert et al., 1996) . These natural mediators were as effective as the 660 
synthetic coumpounds (Johannes and Ma jcherczyk, 2000) . Other natural compounds 661 
including cysteine, methionine, and reduced glutathione, containing sulfhydryl groups, were 662 
also efficient as mediator compounds (Johannes and Majcherczyk, 2000) . 663 
Many reports have studied the oxidation of PAH by purified fungal laccases (Table 3). LACs 664 
of T. versicolor , C. hirsutus, P. ostreatus, and Coriolopsis gallica were the most studied . 665 
For example, T. versicolor  LAC, in combination with HBT, was capable to oxidize two 666 
PAHs, acenaphthene and acenaphthylene; ABTS did not clearly affect the oxidation rate. 667 
LAC without mediator oxidized about 35% of the acenaphthene and only 3% of 668 
acenaphthylene. The principal produc ts obtained after incubation were 1,2- acenaphthenedione 669 
and 1,8 -naphthalic acid anhydride (Johannes et al., 1998). The purified LAC of T. versicolor 670 
did not transform PHE. The supplementation of a redox mediator, ABTS or HBT, to the 671 
reaction mixture improv ed the degradation of PHE by LAC about 40% and 30%, respectively 672 
(Han et al., 2004). LAC produced by C. hirsutus catalyzed The oxidation of five PAHs : FLA, 673 
PYR, ANT, B[a]P, and PHE  in the presence of the redox mediators ABTS and HBT. B[α]P 674 
was the most effectively oxidized substrate In the system  mediated by ABTS , , while ANT 675 
was the most effectively oxidized substrate in the one mediated by HB T. There was no clear 676 
correlation between the IP and the oxidation of the substrates. T he rate of oxidation by LAC 677 
of C. hirsutus  varied  from 10.9 to 97.2%  depending on the PAHs examined. The oxidation  of 678 
FLA and PYR  by C. hirsutus LAC was effective and ranged from 37.9 to 92.7%. PYR which 679 
is one of the least oxidizable PAHs was still oxidized until 40% i n the presence of all the 680 
mediators .   681 
LAC from T. versicolor  catalyzed the in vitro oxidation of ANT and B[a]P which have IPs 682 
≤7.45 eV . The presence of ABTS improve s the oxidation of ANT while  it is crucial  for the 683 22 
 oxidation of B[a]P . Anthraquinone was recognized  as the major  end product of ANT 684 
oxidation (Sutherland et al., 1991). Consequently , the PAH -oxidizing abilities  of LAC differ, 685 
depending on the fungal species from which it was produced (Cho et al., 2002).  686 
ANT was entirely  degraded by the  LAC of Ganoderma lucidum  fungus in the absence of  a 687 
redox mediator. At the same time  and in the presence of the mediator , this  same  LAC 688 
degraded B[a]P, FLU, acenapthene, acenaphthylene, and B[a]A at a rate ranging from 85.3%  689 
to 100% (Pozdnyakova, 2012; Pozdnyakova et al., 2006) . 690 
The degradation of B[a]P by purified LAC of Pycnoporus  cinnabarinus was investigated. The 691 
reaction required the presence of the exogenous ABTS as a mediator. Almost all of the 692 
substrate (95%) was transformed within 24 hours. The enzyme principally oxidized the 693 
substrate to benzo[a]pyrene -1,6-, 3,6- and 6,12 -quinones (Rama et al., 1998).  694 
The effect of different mediators on LAC action  was investigated  by Pickard et al., ( 1999 ). 695 
Different PAHs were oxidized by Coriolopsis gallica LAC  such as  B[a]P, 9 - 696 
methylanthracene, 2 -methylanthracene, ANT, biphenylene, acenaphthene, and PHE. 9 - 697 
methylanthracene was t he most rapidly oxidized substrate . There was no apparent  correlation  698 
between the ionization potential of the substrate and the first -order rate constant for substrate 699 
degradation  in vitro by adding  ABTS. The effects of mediating substrates were studied  700 
furthermore by applying ANT as a substrate. A synergistic effect of HBT and ABTS was 701 
detected. In fact, HBT supported approximately one -half ANT oxidation rate that ABTS 702 
supported, whereas  HBT with ABTS enhanced the oxidation rate nine -fold, compared with 703 
the oxidation rate  supported by  only ABTS (P ickard et al., 1999).  704 
The white -rot fungi generate yellow form of LAC during solid -state fermentation of a 705 
substrate containing natural lignin. The active center of this enzyme is transformed  by the 706 
products of lignin  degradation. Consequently , LAC becomes capable to catalyze the oxidation 707 
of nonphenolic compounds in the absence of  mediators (Pozdnyakova et al., 2006a) . The rate 708 
of degradation using the  yellow LAC produced by  P. ostreatus was also detected . The 709 
naphthalene derivatives α - and β-naphthols, α-nitroso -β naphthol, α-hydroxy-β-naphthoic 710 
acid, and α - naphthylamine were all appropriate LAC substrates despite y ellow LAC did not 711 
catalyze the degradation  of the two- ring PAH naphthalene. Yellow LAC oxidized  all the 712 
PAHs of three to five rings  such as ANT, PYR, FLU, FLA, PHE, and perylene , with rates  of 713 
degradation ranging from  40% to  100%. The efficiencies  were greater  than that observed  for a 714 
blue LAC from the same fungus without and with  ABTS and HBT mediators. . The same 715 
product of ANT oxidation and several  unknown  products of FLU oxidation were noticed  in 716 
solutions of various solvents (Pozdnyakova, 2012; Pozdnyakova et al., 2006) . 717 23 
 9.2 Catalytic cycle of peroxidases  718 
LiP and MnP have a common catalytic cycle, as also observed for other peroxidases (ten 719 
Have and Teunissen, 2001) . One molecule of H 2O2 oxidizes the native enzyme by 720 
withdrawing two electrons, creating compound I. The latter could be reduced back to two 721 
single-electron oxidation steps to the native form through an intermediate compound II. In the 722 
case of LiP, reduction of compound II is the rate -limiting step in the catalytic cycle. For this 723 
reason, this compound is regarded to be less effective than LiP com pound I. As the reduction 724 
of compound II is relatively slow, it is available for longer time for a reaction with H 2O2 725 
resulting in inactive enzyme, identified as compound III which is characterized to be a 726 
complex between LiP and superoxide (Cai and Tien, 1992) . Other fungal enzymes could 727 
provide the needed hydrogen peroxide for peroxidase activity. As part of their ligninolytic 728 
system, white -rot fungi produce H 2O2-generating oxidases (Kirk and Farrell, 1987) , such as 729 
glucose oxidases, glyoxal oxidase, and aryl alcohol oxidase. White -rot fungi that lack H 2O2- 730 
generating oxidases depend on the oxidation of physiological organic acids, such as oxalate 731 
and glyoxylate which indirectly results in H 2O2 (ten Have and Teunissen, 2001) . Also, the 732 
reduction of quinones  to their equivalent hydroquinones and the subsequent autoxidation or 733 
enzymatically catalyzed oxidation may generate H 2O2 due to the involvement and reduction 734 
of O 2 (Muñoz et al., 1997) . 735 
9.2.1 MnP  736 
MnP is distinct from the other peroxidases due to the framework of its binding site. MnP 737 
oxidizes Mn2+ to Mn3+, which cannot be substituted by other metals at physiological 738 
concentrations (Glenn et al., 1986) . At the time of the discovery of MnP, it was revealed that a 739 
number of aliphatic organic acids including lactate and oxalate induced Mn2+ oxidation rate 740 
(Glenn et al., 1986; Matsubara et al., 1996) . These organic acids, e.g., oxalate and to a lower 741 
degree malonate and glyoxylate were demonstrated to be produced as de novo  metabolites by 742 
white -rot fungi (D utton and Evans, 1996) . These acids are able to chelate Mn3+ resulting in a 743 
comparatively stable complex. The complexed Mn3+ can then oxidize phenolic lignin model 744 
compounds and many phenols via phenoxy radical configuration (Jensen et al., 1994) .  Beside 745 
phenolic structures, the MnP system has also been observed to oxidize nonphenolic lignin 746 
model compounds (Hofrichter et al., 1998) . 747 
PAH degradation studies revealed  that MnP from I. lacteus was capable  to eff ectively  degrade 748 
three-  and four -ring PAHs, including phenanthrene, anthracene  and fluoranthene. MnP 749 24 
 produced by Anthracophyllum discolor , degraded pyrene ( >86%), and anthracene ( >65%) 750 
alone or in mixture, and also degraded fluoranthene and phenanthrene  but less e ffectively  751 
(<15.2% and <8.6% , respectively ) (Acevedo et al., 2011). MnP -catalyzed oxidation of PAHs 752 
resulted in respective quinones. Anthrone, which is a n expected intermediate was formed 753 
during the degradation  of anthracene by MnP, and it was followed by the production of 9,10- 754 
anthraquinone. Anthraquinone has earlier been revealed  as the typical  oxidation product in in 755 
vitro reactions of peroxidases. More oxidation resulted in the production of phthalic acid, a s it 756 
was shown in ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium (Hammel et al., 1991). The 757 
characteristic ring -cleavage product 2 -(2_-hydroxybenzoyl) -benzoic acid shows that MnP is 758 
capable to cleave even the aromatic ring of a PAH molecule. One single report w as found 759 
suggesting that MnP does not oxidize anthracene in the presence of Mn2+ (Vazquez -Duhalt et 760 
al., 1994). 761 
Since the high hydrophobicity of PAHs significantly  inhibits the ir degradation in liquid 762 
media,  MnP  degraded  anthracene, dibenzothiophene, and pyrene in the presence of  acetone 763 
(36% v/v), which is a miscible organic solvent. Anthracene was degraded  to phthalic acid and 764 
had the highest  degradation rate, followed by dibenzothiophene and then pyrene (Eibes et al., 765 
2006b) . 766 
Degradation of PAHs by crude MnP produced by  Nematoloma frowardii was  experimented  767 
on separate PAHs: PHE, ANT, PYR, FLA, and B[a]A and then on a mixture of different 768 
PAHs: PHE, ANT, PYR, FLA, CHR, B[a]A, B[a]P, and benzo[b]fluoranthene. The oxidation 769 
of PAHs was enhanced  in the presence  of glutathione which is a mediator substance capable 770 
to generate reactive thiyl radicals. Products of glutathione -mediated MnP mineralization were: 771 
14C-PYR (7.3%), 14C -ANT (4.7%), 14C -B[a]P (4.0%), 14C -B[a]A (2.9%), and 14C -PHE 772 
(2.5%) (Sack et al., 1997c) . The induction effect of reduced glutathione (GSH) was also 773 
investigated by Thomas Günther, ( 1998 ) and show ed an increase of the oxidative strength of 774 
MnP. As a consequence anthracene was fully reduced and 60% of p yrene was degraded after 775 
only 24h.  776 
Therefore, alternative redox mediators, increasing the oxidative effect of MnP have been 777 
investigated. MnP was capable to oxidize FLU which has a high IP value (8.2 eV) and 778 
creosote which is a complex PAHs mixture in the presence of Tween -80. Also, Tween -80 779 
enable MnP produced by Stropharia coronilla to oxidize a large amount of B[a]P into polar 780 
fragments (Steffen et al., 2003).  781 
9.2.2 LiP  782 25 
 LiP is able to oxidize several phenolic and non -phenolic substrates with calculated ionization 783 
potential, a measure for the ease to abstract an electron from the highest filled molecular 784 
orbital, up to 9.0 eV (ten Have and Teuniss en, 2001) . LiP has been revealed to entirely 785 
oxidize methylated lignin and lignin model compounds as well as several polyaromatic 786 
hydrocarbons (Hammel et al., 1992a) . Among the oxidation reactions catalyzed by LiP are the 787 
cleavage of C α-Cβ and aryl C α bond, aromatic ring opening, and demethylation (Kaal et al., 788 
1995) . One secondary metabolite, veratryl alcohol (VA), has been the focus of many studies. 789 
VA is a rich substrate for LiP and increases the oxidation of otherwise weak or terminal LiP 790 
substrate s (Ollikka et al., 1993) . Three main roles of VA have been recommended so far. As 791 
defined earlier, VA could behave as a mediator in electron -transfer reactions. Secondly, VA is 792 
a good substrate for compound II; for that reason, VA is important for completi ng the 793 
catalytic cycle of LiP through the oxidation of terminal substrates.127 Thirdly, VA prevents 794 
the H 2O2-depe ndent inactivation of LiP  by reducing compound II back to native LiP. In 795 
addition, if the inactive LiP compound III is established, the interme diate VA+ is able to 796 
reduce LiP compound III back to its native form (ten Have and Teunissen, 2001) . 797 
Purified LiP from P. chrysosporium had been shown to attack B[a]P using one -electron  798 
abstractions, causing unstable B[a]P radicals which undergo  further spontaneous reactions to 799 
hydroxylated metabolites  and many B[a]P quinones (Haemmerli et al., 1986) . 800 
benzo[a]pyrene -1,6-, 3,6 -, and 6,12 -quinones were detected as the  products  of B[a]P 801 
oxidation by P. chrysosporium  LiP. At the same time  with the appearance of oxidation 802 
products, LiP was inactivated. Similarly to all peroxidases, LiP is inhibited  by the presence of 803 
hydrogen peroxide (Valderrama et al., 2002); the addition of VA to the reaction mixture could 804 
stabiliz e the enzyme. The oxidation rate is ameliorated  more than 14 times  in the presence of  805 
VA, and the most of the enzyme activity was retained during the B[a]P oxidation (Haemmerli  806 
et al., 1986) .  807 
Most of reports  on the oxidation of  PAHs with LiP concentrated  on LiP from P. 808 
chrysosporium as shown in Table 3. Anthraquinone is t he major  product of anthr acene 809 
oxidation by LiP produced by  P. chrysosporium (Field et al., 1996). Hammel et al., ( 1986a ) 810 
demonstrated  that LiP produced by  P. chrysosporium catalyzes the degradation of certain 811 
PAHs with IP <7.55 eV. As a consequence,  H2O2-oxidized  states of LiP are more oxidizing 812 
than the analogous states of  standard  peroxidases.  813 
Studies on pyrene as a  substrate  showed that pyrene -1,6-dione and pyrene -1,8-dione are  the 814 
principle  oxidation products. Gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry analysis of LiP - 815 26 
 catalyzed pyrene oxidation done  in the presence of H 2O2 revealed  that the quinone oxygens  816 
come from water. The one -electron oxidative mechanism of LiP is relevant  to lignin and 817 
lignin -related substructures as well as certain polycyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic 818 
contaminants.  The oxidation of pyrene by entire cultures of P. chrysosporium also generated  819 
these quinones. As a result , it can be concluded that LiP catalyzes the first step in the 820 
degradation  of these compounds by entire  cultures of P. chrysosporium  (Hammel et al., 821 
1986) . 822 
Vazquez -Duhalt et al., ( 1994)  utilized LiP from P. chrysosporium to investigate the oxidation 823 
of anthracene, 1 -, 2-, and 9 - methylanthracenes, acenaphthene, fluoranthene, pyrene, 824 
carbazole, and  dibenzothiophene. Among the studied compounds, LiP was able  to oxidize 825 
compounds with IP <8 eV. The greatest specific activity  of PAHs oxidation was shown when 826 
pHs are between 3.5 and 4.0. T he reaction products involve  hydroxyl and keto groups. The 827 
product of anthracene oxidation was  9,10-anthraquinone. The products of LiP oxidation of 1-  828 
and 2 -methylanthracene were 1 - and 2 -methylanthraquinone, respectively.  829 
9,10- anthraquinone, 9-methyleneanthranone, and 9- methanol -9,10- dihydroanthracene were 830 
the products detected by from the oxidation of 9 -methylanthracene (Vazquez -Duhalt et al., 831 
1994) . Anthraquinone resulting from c arbon- carbon bond cleavage  of 9-methylanthracene, 832 
was also observed. The mass spectra of the two products resulting from acenaphthene 833 
correspond to 1-acenaphthenone and 1 -acenaphthenol. The comparison of the GC -mass 834 
spectrometry analysis of dibenzothiophene oxidation by LiP with a sample of authentic 835 
dibenzothiophene  sulfoxide resulted in sulfoxide . The UV spectrum of the product of pyrene 836 
oxidation most closely fitted that of 1,8 - pyrenedione. In spite fluoranthene and carbazole 837 
were oxidized, their products were not established (Vazquez -Duhalt et al., 1994).  838 
Torres  et al., ( 1997)  studied LiP, cytochrome c , and hemoglobin for oxidation of PAHs in the 839 
presence of hydrogen peroxide and demonstrated that LiP oxidized anthracene, 2 - 840 
methylanthracene, 9 - hexylanthracene, pyrene, acenaphthene, and benzo[a]pyrene; the 841 
unreacted compounds included chrysene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, triphenylene, biphenyl, 842 
and dibenzofuran. The oxidation of the aromatic compounds by LiP matched with their IPs; 843 
only those compounds that had IPs <8 eV were transformed. The reaction products from  the 844 
three hemoproteins (LiP, cytochrome c, and hemoglobin) were principally quinones, which 845 
suggest that the three biocatalysts have the same oxidation mechanism. The resulting product 846 
from anthracene was anthraquinone, and the resulting product from 2- methylanthracene was 847 
2-methylanthraquinone. The ending  products for pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene  oxidation  were 848 
pyrenedione and benzo[a]pyrenedione, respectively. The mass spectra results of the products 849 27 
 from acenaphthene degradation catalyzed by  LiP correlated  well with  1-acenaphthenone and 850 
1-acenaphthenol (Torres et al., 1997). 851 
Expriments on the catalytic properties of ligninolytic enzymes demonstrates  that degradation 852 
by LiP is restricted  to certain range of compounds according to their IP values. Furthermore , 853 
the catalytic activities of MnP and LAC are extended to the following factors (a) the presence 854 
of some natural and synthetic mediators  such as  ABTS for LAC  and gluthatione for MnP and 855 
LAC ; (b) the modification of the active center of LAC during fermentat ion of a fungi on 856 
lignin -containing natural substrates; (c) the combination of PAH oxidation with  lipid 857 
peroxidation (MnP and LAC). Therefore, MnP and LAC can be considered as the most 858 
effective in PAHs oxidation since their role extends  to the initial oxidation and production of 859 
quinones  (Pozdnyakova, 2012) . 860

9.2.3 Catalytic cycle of laccase  865 
Laccases are known to catalyze the oxidation of a significant variety of phenolic compounds 866 
and aromatic amines (Peng et al., 2015) . When certain substrates can potentially provide two 867 
electrons such as ABTS, laccases carry out one -electron oxidation. As a result, radicals are 868 
produced which undergo subsequent non -enzymatic reactions as seen in Equation 6.  869 
4𝑅𝐻+𝑂2→4𝑅+2𝐻2𝑂                                                           ( 6) 28 
  870 
Hundreds of studies  have been done on the  characteristics of fungal laccases. And m ost of the 871 
research  has been investigating tree laccases or other copper -containing oxidases (Tollin et 872 
al., 1993) . 873 
Even though, the redox potential of laccases (0.5- 0.8 V) does not favor the oxidation of non- 874 
phenolic compounds, numerous studies have demonstrated that laccases are capable of 875 
oxidizing compounds which have redox potentials higher than that of the enzyme. In these 876 
studies, ABTS, 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 3- hydroxyanthrani - late were applied as  a 877 
cooxidant/mediator, and non -phenolic lignin, veratryl alcohol, and PAH were oxidized 878 
(Collins and Dobson, 1996; Eggert et al., 1996; Bourbonnais et al., 1997; Majcherczyk et al., 879 
1998a) . The enzyme kinetic background of these reactions is still not identified.  880 
10 Conclusions  881 
Enzymatic bioremediation is the tool to convert PAHs  to less harmful/non- harmful forms with 882 
less chemicals, energy, and time. It is a solution to degrade/remove contaminants in an eco - 883 
friendly way.  From the early to the current  research , vast range of fungi have proved their 884 
efficiency in the bioremediation of PAH -contaminated wastes through enzymes , such as MnP,  885 
LiP, laccase and other  fungal enzymes , such as Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, epoxide 886 
hydrolases, lipases, protease and dioxygenases . 887 
 The enzymatic bioremediation of a pollutant and the rate at which it is reached relies upon 888 
the environmental conditions, number and type of the microorganisms , characteristics of the 889 
chemical compound to degrade. Hence, to improve the degradation rate and develop a 890 
bioremediation system, various factors are accountable which need to be dealt with and are to 891 
be investigated , such as pretreatment at high temperat ure. 892 
Powerful and cost -effective bioremediation should involve either entire mineralization of the 893 
PAHs or at minimum biotransformation to less harmful compounds. Generally, fungal rates of 894 
degradation of PAHs are slow and inefficient compared to bacteria;  however, since numerous 895 
fungi have the ability to hydroxylate a wide variety of PAHs, their ecological role could be 896 
significant since these polar intermediates can be mineralized by soil bacteria or detoxified to 897 
simpler non- hazardous compounds. Additionally, fungi have an advantage over bacteria since 898 
the fungal mycelium could grow into the soil and spread itself through the solid matrix to 899 
degrade the PAHs. To improve and empower biodegradative potential of fungi, substantial 900 29 
 research on the enzymes included in PAH degradation pathways and on the molecular 901 
genetics and biochemistry of catabolic pathways is required.  902
