 Abstract  37 
Microplastics represent an increasing source of anthropogenic contamination in aquatic 38 
environments, where they may also act as scavengers and transporters of persistent organic 39 
pollutants. As estuaries are amongst the most productive  aquatic systems, it is important to 40 
understand sorption behaviour and transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs)  by 41 
microplastics along estuarine  gradients. The effects of salinity sorption equilibrium kinetics  42 
on the distribution coefficients ( Kd) of phenanthrene (Phe) and 4,4’ -DDT, onto 43 
polyvinylchloride ( PVC) and onto polyethylene (PE) were  therefore investigated. A salinity 44 
gradient representing freshwater, estuarine and marine conditions, with salinities 45 
corresponding to  0 (MilliQ water, 690 S/cm), 8.8, 17.5, 26.3 and 35  was used. Salinity had 46 
no significant effect on the time required t o reach equilibrium onto PVC  or PE and  neither 47 
did it affect  desorption rates of contaminants from plastics. Although salinity had no effect on 48 
sorption capacit y of Phe onto plastics, a slight  decrease  in sorption capacity was observe d for 49 
DDT with salinity . Salinity had little effect on sorption behaviour and POP/plastic 50 
combination was  shown to be  a more important factor. Transport of Phe and DDT from 51 
riverine to brackish and marine w aters by plastic is therefore  likely to be much  more 52 
dependent on the aqueous POP concentration than on salinity. The physical characteristics of 53 
the polymer and local environmental conditions (e.g. plastic density, particle residen ce time 54 
in estuaries) will affect  the physical transport of contaminated plastics.  A transport model of 55 
POPs by microplastics under estuarine conditions is proposed. Transport of  Phe and DDT  by 56 
PVC and PE  from fresh and brackish water  toward fully marine c onditions was  the most 57 
likely net direction for contaminant transport and followed the order: Phe -PE >> DDT -PVC = 58 
DDT -PE >> Phe -PVC.  59

 Introduction  61 
 62 
Plastics are considered essential in our everyday lives and are used i n a wide range of 63 
applications,  from food packaging, renewab le energy  and medical devices. W orld production 64 
was 265 million tonnes in 2010,  of which 57 million tonnes was  produced in Europe  (The 65 
plastic industry, 2011 ). The in creasing demand for plastics, their low cost of production and 66 
high availability mean that end -of-life plastics are accumulating in the environment . The 67 
majority of plastic m arine litter is believed  to come  from land -based sources (Sheavly, 2005 ). 68 
The degradation ra te of plastic debris  in the  environment is slow and results in production of  69 
small fragments and microplastics . Degradation into small plastic fragments represents an 70 
indirect source of microplastics (Barnes et al., 2009 ; Sivan, 2011 ) which c an also arise  from 71 
direct sources  such as industrial accidental spillages or the release of microbeads use d in 72 
cosmetics through wastewaters  (Browne et al., 2011 ; Fendall and Sewell, 2009 ). There is 73 
evidence that the ab undance  microplastics  is increasing in the marine environment (Doyle et 74 
al., 2011 ; Thompson et al., 2004 ) and are potentially  bioavailable to a wide  range of 75 
organisms, for example via ingestion  (Browne et al., 2008 ; Thompson et al., 2009 ) which 76 
have been reported  in populations of comm ercially important fish (Lusher et al., 2013 ), 77 
crustaceans (Murray and Cowie, 2011 ) as well as seabirds such as the Northern Fulmar  (van 78 
Franeker, 198 5). Laboratory studies have also con firmed that both filter feeding  and de posit 79 
feeding invertebrates  also ingest microplastics  (Thompson et al., 2004 ; Ward and Shumway, 80 
2004 ). Relatively little is known o n about the physical (Wright et al., 2013 ) and toxicological 81 
effects  (Bakir et al., submitted ) of ingestion of microplastics. Microplastics can accumulate in 82 
the digestive gland of marine b ivalves and m icroplastics (< 9.6 m) we re able to translocate 83 
to the haemolymph in the common mussel Mytilus edulis , where they persisted for at least 48 84 5 
 days (Browne et al., 2008 ). It has also been suggested that ingestion, retention, egestion and 85 
possible re -ingestion of microplastics present potential mechanisms for the  transport of 86 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and  also for  the release of chemical additives from 87 
plastics to organisms  (Ryan et al., 1988 ; Tanaka et al., 2013 ). This will be depende nt on the 88 
nature of the chemical substance involved , the size of the plastic  particle  and from the 89 
perspective of this study, the surrounding physical and chemical environment.  90 
Estuaries are among  the most productive marine environments , providing habitats for a wide 91 
diversity of seab irds, fish and mammals and  are economically important  for the  exploitation  92 
of fish and shellfish  (Allen et al., 2006 ). As microplastics can be carried to the sea via rivers , 93 
(Moore et al., 2002 ) they are likely to be transported t o the marine environment via  estuaries 94 
with the potential to be ingested by estuarine organisms. There is also potential for 95 
microplastics to be transported back into estuarine habitats from the sea  by tidal flow . Short - 96 
term transport potential of POPs by microplastics from estuaries to marine waters is under 97 
investigation in this study as estuaries represent relatively rapidly changing physical 98 
environments in terms of salinity. In contrast, long -term transport potential  for POPs by 99 
plastic debris, based on mass fluxes, was suggested to be of less importance compared to 100 
other pathways such as atmospheric transport and transport of dissolved compounds by ocean 101 
currents (Zarfl and Matthies, 2010 ). 102 
Browne et al. (2010) showed that microplastics were abundant in the intertidal zone in the 103 
Tamar estuary (UK) and Costa et al. (2011)  showed that plastic debris is  also found buried in 104 
estuarine sediments . Salinity , temperature and  the presence of dissolved organic matter 105 
appear to be  the main parameters governing the solubility of hydrophobic organic compounds  106 
such as POPs (Delle Site, 2001 ). Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect s of each of 107 
these parameters on the sorpti on and desorption  of POPs by microplastics. The assessment of 108 
sorption behaviour of POPs and their transport by microplastics is an important factor in their 109 6 
 environmental risk assessment required to reach Good Environmental Status (GES) as part of 110 
the quali ty descriptor 1 0 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD  2008/56/EC ). 111 
MSFD  aims  to establish “a framework within which Member States shall take the necessary 112 
measures to achieve or ma intain GES  in the marine environment by the year 2020”.   113 
The pre sent study investigated  the sorption behaviour of phenanthrene (Phe) and DDT  onto 114 
unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) and ultra high molecular weight polyethyle ne (PE) , 115 
due to their widespread pre sence in the marine environment (Browne et al., 2011 ; Frias et al., 116 
2010 ; Graham and Thompson, 2009 ; Ng and Obbard, 2006 ; Thompson et al., 2009 ), at 117 
different saliniti es to represent transition zones from riverine to marine waters. A transport 118 
model, taking into account reported environmental concentrations of the two contaminants 119 
for riverine, estuarine and marine waters, is also proposed in order to char acterise any 120 
potential risks.  121 
 122 
Materials and m ethods  123 
Sample preparation and characterisation  124 
Unplasticised p olyvinyl chloride (uPVC) and ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) 125 
polyethylene powder (Goodfellow, Huntington, UK) were sieved  to the size ra nge 200 – 250 126 
μm to be  representative of  micropla stics found  in marine waters (Doyle, 2008 ; Thompson et 127 
al., 2004 ). PVC and PE were selected as plastics for study due to their widespread presence in 128 
the marine environment (Frias et al., 2010 ; Graham and Thompson, 2009 ; Ng and Obbard, 129 
2006 ). Seawater was filtered ( Whatman membrane filter cellulose nitrate 0.45 m pore size ) 130 
and autoclaved before use  to reduce microbial activity  and to remove any suspended 131 7 
 particulate matter (SPM) . The salinity  range under investig ation was 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %  132 
seawater corresponding to 0  (690 S/cm) , 8.8, 17.5, 26.3  and 35 psu (practical scale unit).  133 
 134 
Sorption of phenanthrene and DDT to plastics  135 
Analysi s of samples over a period of 360  hours showed that equilibrium con centrations in 136 
seawater  and on the plastic were reached after 24 hours  (Bakir et al., 2014 ). Equilibrium 137 
sorption time of POPs onto plastics in MilliQ only was also investigated over a period of 360  138 
hours. Details of the selected radiolabeled contaminants, suppliers and concentration range 139 
are listed in Table 1. The concentration range  for Phe (0.6 – 6.1 g L-1) was relevant to 140 
environmental concentrations as Phe predominantly enters the marine environment in la rge 141 
pulses through storm waters  (Teuten et al., 2007 ). The concentration range  used for DDT in 142 
seawater  (0.8 – 3.1 g L-1) was lower  due to  lower concentrations of this legacy pollutant that 143 
are typically  encoun tered in the marine environment  (Carvalho et al., 2009 ; Tan et al., 2009 ).  144 
Sorption  experiments were conducted in an ISO9001 accredi ted radioisotope facility at 145 
Plymouth University. Either PVC or PE  (10 mg)  were  placed  into each of 12 glass centrifuge 146 
tubes  (50 mL)  and an increasing co ncentration of the POP  was added to the walls of the tubes 147 
and the solvent  allowed to evaporate. 25 mL  of seawater were added and t he tubes were 148 
capped and equilibrate d in the dark for 24 hours at 18 ºC, with continuous horizontal, rotary 149 
agitation (220 rpm). All sorption experiments were conducted in triplicate.  150 
The concentration of Phe  or DDT was determi ned in the aqueous and solid phase s by 151 
counting the β decay from the 14C-Phe and 14C-4,4’-DDT by liquid scintillation counting 152 
(LSC) in Ultima Gold (Perkin -Elmer) scintillation cocktail. To measure the aqueous Phe  and 153 
DDT concentrations, 5 mL of seawater was added to scintillation cocktail and counted by 154 8 
 LSC (Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system) . To de termine the Phe  and DDT co ncentration s 155 
on the sorbent s, plastic particles were collected by filtration  (Whatman me mbrane filter 156 
cellulose nitrate 0.45 m pore size) , added  to 5 mL scintillation cockta il and counted directly 157 
by LSC. Data  indicated that the presence of ≤  10 mg plastic did not quench the signal or 158 
affect  the count rate (Teuten et al., 2007 ). The amount of contaminant in each phase was 159 
quantified using a calibration curve prepared by counting known amounts of the contaminant. 160 
Total recovery and recovery for each phase are listed in the supplementary information 161 
(Table S1).  162 
The distribution coefficient, Kd, was cal culated using the equatio n: 163

where qe is the amount of contaminant sorbed onto plastic ( g kg-1) at equilibrium and Ce is 166

For comparison with the linear model ( Kd values), the data were also analysed with the 169 
Freundlich model (Eq.2). Freundlich  sorption isotherms have been widely used to model 170

2007).  172

Desorption of contaminants from plastic  181 
In order to characterise the effect of salinity on the desorption rates of contaminants from 182 
plastic, Phe was sorbed to plastics as described above, giving final sorbate concentrations of 2 183 
– 4 μg g-1. The filtered solid phase (10 mg) was transferred to a 100 mL amber jar, and 75 mL 184 
seawater  (full salinity , 35 psu ) or 75 mL of MilliQ (0 % salinity , 690 S/cm ) were added. 185 
The jars were equilibrated in the dark in a water bath with rotary agitation  (220 rpm). 186 
Aliquots (1 mL) were remov ed at recorded times (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 45, 75, 130 and 180 min)  187 
and the aqueous concentration of contaminant was determined by LSC. Plastics were allowed 188 
to settle for 1 min before sampling. The concentration of contam inant on the solid phase was 189 
calculated by difference, taking into account both the amount sorbed to the walls and the total 190 
recovery. All kinetic experiments were conducted in triplicate. Pseudo -first order rate 191 
analyses were used to determine the rate co nstant for initial desorption, where the extent of 192 
resorpti on was assumed to be negligible (Teuten et al., 2007 ). The rate constant ( k) for the 193 
loss of contaminant from the solid phase was determined from the gradient of plots of 194 
ln(Ci/Ci,0) vs. time.  195 
 196 
Statistical analysis  197 10 
 Two-way ANOVA s were  applied to character ise a ny significant differences  between the 198 
distribution coefficients of both DDT and Phe onto PVC and PE. Student -Newman -Keuls 199 
(SNK) tests were then used to identify any significant terms. A three factor ANOVA was also 200 
applied with sa linity, type of plastic and type of pollutant as fixed factors.  A multivariate 201 
analysis was also performed to compare differences of sorption capacity for different 202 
salinities for all POP/plastic combinations.  Cochran’s test was used to ensure that the d ata 203 
fulfilled the pre -requisites for parametric analysis and the appropriate data were ln(x+1) 204 
transformed.  As an additional precaution step for any type I errors , a more conser vative p 205 
value was selected (p <  0.01) where heterogeneous variances remained aft er transformation. 206 
Analysis was conducted as ANOVA is considered robust to such departure from normality 207 
where large data sets are employed  (Underwood, 1997 ). The tests were carried out usi ng 208

Results  and discussion  211 
We sought to investigate the effects of  salinity on the sorption and transport of persistent 212 
organic pollutants (POPs) by plastic microparticles i n riverine, estuarine and marine systems.  213 
As model combination s, sorption equilibrium time of DD T onto PVC  and Phe onto PE were  214 
investigated in seawater (35 psu) and in MilliQ water  over a period of 15 days (Fig.1 ). 215 
Sorption equilibrium was reached in 24 hours and s alinity was found to have no significant 216 
effect  (p > 0.01 and p = 0. 229 and p = 0.601 ) on sorption equilibrium time of Phe onto PE 217 
and DDT onto PVC respectively. This indicates that contaminants will reach equilibrium 218 
conditions onto plastics re latively quickly in freshwater, brackish or marine waters.  219 11 
 Differences in salinity produced  no significant  effect s on th e distribution coefficient  values 220 
calculated for Phe sorption onto plastics ( Fig.2, Table S3). However, s ignificantly higher 221 
concentrations of DDT were sorbed onto PVC and PE (p < 0.01,  Table S3) in MilliQ water 222 
compared  at higher salinities.  Kd values calculated in MilliQ water for DDT sorption onto 223 
plastics were 1.4 and 1.6 times greater for PVC and PE respectively than using seawater (35 224 
psu). Kd values calculated for DDT sorption onto PVC than PE showed higher variability than 225 
for Phe (Fig.2) and there was a clear trend of decreasing sorption of DDT with increasing 226 
salinity. Larger Kd values for DDT sorption onto plastics could be explained by differences in 227 
sorption mechanism between DDT and Phe. We previously suggested that DDT sorption onto 228 
polymer follows a partition and pore -filling mechanism as opposed to Phe which may only 229 
occur s through a pore -filling mechanism, thus explaining higher affinity of DDT for plastic  230 
(Bakir et al., 2012 ; Obst et al., 2011 ). As aqueous solubility of DDT dec reases with an 231 
increase in salinity, salinity might be a greater concern for the sorption of DDT onto plastics 232 
than for Phe. As salinity had no effect on Phe, following a pore -filling mechanism, salinity 233 
may have decreased the partitioning of DDT onto plas tics. Solubility of organic compounds 234 
decreases wit h an increase in salinity and salt content in aqueous phase affects partitioning of 235 
organic chemicals into other phases (Borrirukwisitsak et al., 2012 ).  236 
The Freundlich model fitted the experimental data well with high correlation coefficients  237 
(Fig.S5 and S6 and T able 2 ). However, differences in salinity had no effects on the sorption 238 
capacity of the two plastics as shown by the Log KF values (Fig.S7). This indicates that  the 239 
sorption behaviour of these two plastics for the two POPs will be influenced by the 240 
environmental concentrations of the contaminant, independently of salinity. Log KF values 241 
were the lowest for Phe sorption onto PVC, followed by Phe sorption onto PE. Highest 242 
values were found for DDT sorption onto PE and PVC. Consequently, PVC and PE have the 243 
potential to sorb and transport relatively higher amounts of DDT than Phe.  244 12 
 A study by Karapanagioti et al. (2 005),  on Phe  sorption onto different sorbents, also showed 245 
that salinity did  not affect  the k inetics of sorptive uptake by  PE and polyoxymethylene resins 246 
(as compared to materials containing organic matter) , although the so rption equilibrium point 247 
was higher  (Karapanagioti et al., 2005 ). In the present study, salinity did not have any 248 
significant effect on the sorption equilibrium kinetics of DDT onto PVC.  249 
Sorption behaviour of POPs onto polymers can be compared to sorption onto sediments 250 
following a dual -mode model comprising a partitioning and adsorption dom ain due to the 251 
presence of soil organic matter (SOM) (Xing and Pignatello, 1997 ; Xing et al., 1996 ; Zhao et 252 
al., 2002 ). However, the e ffects of sa linity appear  to be different for marine sediments 253 
probably due to the presence of organic carbon which s howed a positive correlation between  254 
Phe sorption onto sediments  and the organic carbon content  (Brunk et al., 1996 ; Yang and 255 
Zheng, 2010 ). Indeed, the sorption behaviour of phenanthrene on marine sediments, showed 256 
that the initial rate and equilibrium rate constant of adsorption increase d with an increase in  257 
salinity  (Yang and Zheng, 2010 ). Another study by Xu et al. (2009) showed that sorption of 258 
benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) on the sediments also increased with salinity. As the sorption 259 
potential of a POP is regulated by its solubility, an increase in salinity reduces its solubility 260 
and therefore is likely to facilitate  its association with sediments (Xu and Li, 2009 ). This is 261 
supported by an earlier study from the same authors on the adsorption behavio ur of dibutyl 262 
phthalate (DBP) which showed that a decrease in salinity decreased the amount of DBP 263 
adsorbed on the sediment (Xu and Li, 2009 ). Brunk (1997) also suggested that an increase in 264 
Ca2+ and Mg2+ might cause the dissolved organic matter (DOM) to precipitate and to coat  265 
sediments increasi ng their organic content and thu s their sorption capacity for POPs. The 266 
same can therefore be applied for buried plastic materials being coated by organic matter, 267 
potentially increasing their sorption capacity for pollutants.  268 
 269 13 
 Desorption  kinetics of contaminants from plastic  270 
Salinity was found to have no significant effects on the desorption rates of sorbed Phe and 271 
DDT from PVC and PE (Table 3, p > 0.01, Table S4). Linear plots are shown in the 272 
supplementary information (Fig. S8  and S9 ). Desorption rates for DDT from  plastics were 273 
much slower than for Phe (p < 0.01, Table S4) but no significant differences were found 274 
considering the plastic type (p = 0.087, Table S4).  275 
 276 
Transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) onto plastics from r iverine to marine 277 
systems  278 
Salinity had  little effect , at least for the combinations used herein, on the sorption of 279 
microplastics for POPs. If this is  generally true  for other plastic/contaminant combinations , 280 
transport of contaminants fro m riverine to marine waters is likely to  be more  dependent  on 281 
the POP concentration  and transport behaviour of microplastics including their  residence time 282 
in each system (riverine, estuarine or marine)  than the type of plastic . Phe and DDT are found 283 
in hig her con centrations in  estuaries  compared to riverine and marine waters (Tables 2 and 284 
S5). This is not surprising since  most anthropogenic organic contaminants  (POPs)  come from 285 
land sources , with estua ries acting as a “sink” , especially for POPs  transported  by sediments 286 
(Ridgway and Shimmield, 2002 ; Zhou et al., 1999 ).  287 
Using  the distribution coefficients ( Kd) values measured herein, the amount of Phe and DDT 288 
sorbed onto PVC and PE  was estimated  and plotted for the different systems (rivers, estuaries 289 
and marine environment)  (Fig.3), using typical aqueous concentrations  for these 290 
environments (average values shown in Table 4, full concentration listed in Table S5 ). 291 14 
 Statistical analysis showed significant differences between POP  concentrations  expected on  292 
plastics for the different POP/plastic combinations (p < 0.01). The concentration of POP  293 
sorbed onto plastics follow ed the order: Phe -PE >> DDT -PVC = DDT -PE = Phe -PVC. 294 
Significant differences (p < 0.01) were also observed for POP uptake  within the different 295 
compartments (riverine, estuarine and marin e waters) with some exceptions . Statistical 296 
analysis showed that sorbed  concentration of POPs from plastics was higher for estuaries  297 
(salinity 17.5)  than for freshw ater and marine waters (p < 0.01 , Fig.3 ).  298 
Statistical analysis also showed that the concentrations of POPs in each environment were 299 
more important (p > 0.01 and p  =0.718) than the nature of the plastic (p < 0.01 and p = 0.001 , 300 
Table S4) . Therefore the uptake and transport of POPs  by plastics  in estuarine conditions will 301 
be more related to the input concentrations of the pollutant s than the type of polymer present 302 
as a carrier.  303 
The amount of contaminants sorbed onto plastics  is expected to be  greater for  plastics in  304 
estuaries  as compared to riverine or  marine waters  because aqueous POP concentrations  are 305 
greater  in these environments  (Fig.3) . Sorption equilibrium will be directly dependant on the 306 
transport of microplastics from riverine to marine waters, including particle residence time 307 
for each system. Our results indicate that sorption equilibrium was reached within 24 hours 308 
with no signific ant effect of salinity. As a result freshwaters, estuaries and marine  waters 309 
could be considered as  single compartment s where particles are continuously exposed to 310 
organic pollutants at different concentrations. Previous studies have shown that sorption 311 
equilibrium for Phe, DDT, perfluorooctanoic acid  (PFOA) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate  312 
(DEHP) onto PVC and PE is reached within 24 -48 hours (Bakir et al., 2014 ). As a result , 313 
sorption of POPs onto microplastics is expected to reach equilibrium before their release to 314 
the marine environment.  315 15 
 As discussed by Ballent et al. (2012) a series of factors will influence the transport of 316 
microplastics from riverine to marine waters. Intrinsic properties of the plastic such as density, 317 
shape and size and external factors such as seawater density, seabed topogr aphy, flow 318 
velocity, turbulence  and pressure  will dictate the part icle retention time in each system (rivers, 319 
estua ries and sea) . It has also been suggested that transpo rt of microplastics in rivers may be  320 
similar to the transport of sediments (Ballent et al., 2012 ; Browne et al., 2010 ; Costa et al., 321 
2011 ; Galgani et al., 2000 ). Fine sediments are carried in suspension (Uncles and Stephens, 322 
2010 ), which is also suspected to be the main transpor t mechanism for microplastics. Particle 323 
transit and retention  time will therefore be dependent on several factors such as particle size, 324 
and factors specific to the ty pe of estuary such as geographical , meteorological (winds)  and 325 
morphological settings , stratification  and flushing time. Other factors, such as the presence of 326 
organic matter or the presence of biofilms, have also been suggested,  facilitating the retention 327 
of suspended particles in estuaries (Uncles and Stephens, 2010 ) or by increasing their 328 
sorption capacity for pollutants (Brunk et al., 1996 ). Browne et al. ( 2010) suggested that 329 
small particles of sediment and plastic are both likely to settle slowly from the water -column 330 
and are likely to be transported by the flow of water and be deposited in areas where the 331 
water  movements  are slower.  332 
Desorption studies indicated that desorption rates will remain consistent independent  of 333 
salinity. Amo unts of desorbed contaminants are expected to be greater in estuaries where 334 
particle retention time is expected to be the longest (Ballent et al., 2012 ). Overall, desorption 335 
rates of Phe from plastics in water were found to be faster than for DDT which is suspected to 336 
remained sorbed onto plastics. The time required for the concentration of the contaminant 337 
onto plastic in estuaries to reach to the concentration of sorbed contaminants in marine waters 338 
was estimated using eq.3 and using desorption rates calculated in this study (Fig.S10 and 339 
Table S6).  340 16

POP onto plastic ( g g-1) at time t (in days)  and k is the desorption rate constant for the first 345 
order model (day-1).  346 
 347 
The results indicated that 5 days were required for the co ncentration of Phe sorbed onto PVC 348 
and PE  in est uaries to  desorb and  reach concentration estimated in marine waters  (Fig.4) . A 349 
much longer timescale was required for DDT desorption from plastics with 13 and 15 days 350 
for PVC and PE respectively. The potential for microplastics to transport pollutants from  351 
estuaries will therefore be dependent on the estuary’s cycle  including flushing and particle 352 
residence time. Jay et al. (1997) characterised the particle residence time for some estuaries 353 
for different locations. Timescales varied from 3 to 9 months for Chesapeake Bay to 0.5 day 354 
for Plum Island Sound  (Jay et al., 1997 ). For estuaries presenting a short particle retention 355 
time, microplastics are therefore l ikely  to act as vec tors for transport of Phe and DDT  to 356 
marine waters  but with limited exposure to organisms . For estuaries with longer retention 357 
time, such as Chesapeake Bay, desorption of POPs from plastics could be of concern as well 358 
as the exposure of contaminated particles to aquatic organisms. It is however unknown 359 
whether the contaminants sorbed onto plastics can then desorb upon ingestion by marine 360 
organisms at concentrations which may cause significant harm or ecologically adverse effects. 361 
Micropla stic ingestion has been documented for a wide range of organisms at many trophic 362 
levels (Avery -Gomm et al., 2012 ; Besseling et al., 2012 ; Blight and Burger, 1997 ; Boerger et 363 17 
 al., 2010 ; Bravo Rebolledo et al. ; Browne et al., 2008 ; Day, 1980 ; Denuncio et al., 2011 ; 364 
Lusher et al., 2013 ) with some evidence of trophic transfer of plastics (Farrell and Nelson, 365 
2013 ). Transfer of sorbed conta minants from plastic following ingestion has also been 366 
suggested (Tanaka et al., 2013 ). As estuaries are the most productive ecosystems in the 367 
marine environment and due to the relatively long particle retention time in such systems; it 368 
is highly likely that a wide range of marine organisms are exposed to contaminated 369 
microplastics, but the chem ical effects, if any, of this are unknown. Microplastics can enter 370 
the marine environment through land -based sources and are exposed to POPs from 371 
anthropogenic sources, where sorption takes place. Contaminated particles are then 372 
transported into estuaries where they can reside for a relatively long time, depending on the 373 
type of estuary. Contaminated particles can also settle,  accumulate or being buried onto 374 
sediments as well as being  deposited on the shoreline  (Browne et al., 2011 ; Browne et al., 375 
2010 ). Man-made operations  involving the suspension of sediments , such as dredging , could 376 
cause a large release of contaminated particles i nto the marine environment.  377 
Estuaries can also been defined as sink of contami nated particles  with their pulse release  in 378 
marine waters  following flushing. Contaminated plastics can also increase in density 379 
following biofouling  and as a result can be found at the sea surface microlayer (SML), in  the 380 
water column or deposited onto sediments where they are  potentially expos ed to a wide ra nge 381 
of marine organisms for  ingestion.  382 
 383 
Conclusions  384 
Increase s in salinity had no  significant effect s on the sorption capacity of  PVC and PE  for 385 
Phe; however sorption capacity for DDT was significantly higher in the absence of salinity  386 
sugge sting a differential mechanism of sorption for contaminants . The transport capacity  of 387 18 
 these plastics for D DT and Phe in estuaries will likely  be more related to the aqueous 388 
concentration of th e contaminants  than to the salinity.  The transport model proposed showed 389 
that the amount  of POPs sorbed by plastics in freshwater , to brackish  and marine wa ters 390 
followed the order: Phe -PE >> DDT -PVC = DDT -PE >> Phe -PVC. Microplastics have the 391 
potential to sorb substantially more  contaminants in estuaries due to  higher  reported 392 
concentrations of contamina nts than in  riverine and marine waters. Sorption equilibrium  of 393 
POPs onto microplastics  is also expected to be reached in each system due to their long 394 
particle residence  and potential storage in estuarine sediments . As desorption rates of sorbed 395 
contaminants were  not affected by salinity, amounts desorbed are expected to be correlated to 396 
the part icle retention time in estuaries and marine waters . The proposed transport mo del 397 
suggested that estuaries can represent an important source for contaminated microplastics 398 
with their pulse release to the marine environment through natural (e.g. flushing) and 399 
anthropogenic processes (e.g. dredging).  400 
This study suggests that the risk  assessment for the potential for microplastics to cause harm 401 
in the environment , as part of the MSFD,  should not be limited to the marine environment but 402 
also include estuarine systems which are suspected to represent an important source  and sink  403 
of conta minated plastics.   404
