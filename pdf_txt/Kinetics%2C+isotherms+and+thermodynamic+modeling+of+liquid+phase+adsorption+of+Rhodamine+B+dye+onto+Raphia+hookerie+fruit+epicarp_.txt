Highly efficient low cost adsorbent was prepared from Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp.
Characteristics of the prepared low cost adsorbent (RH) was established using scanning
electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Brunauer –Emmett –
Teller (BET) surface area. RH was applied for Rhodamine B (RhB) uptake from aqueoussolution. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using four isotherms and kinetic data
tested with five kinetic models. The BET surface area obtained was 0.00351 m
2/g; SEM
reveals large pores that could enhance the uptake of large molecules. Freundlich isothermbest described the uptake of RhB onto RH, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity
(q
max) was 666.67 mg/g. Pseudo second order model best described the kinetics of adsorption
process. Energy of adsorption (E) obtained from D-R isotherm suggests physical adsorption.Desorption efficiency follows the order H
2O4HCl4CH3COOH. Cost analysis shows that RH is
about 1143 times more economical when compared with commercial activated carbon.

1. Introduction
Textile industries generate large volume of wastewater that majorly emanate from the dye preparation, spent dye, bath
and washing stages. This wastewater usually contains loads of dye molecules that are hazardous, thereby posing threats tohuman and other living organisms in the environment [1]. Textile industries utilize varieties of dyes such as anthraquinone
based meta complex, reactive, acidic, azo, diazo, and basic. While dyeing of wool, silks, acrylic and nylon is commonly done
using basic dyes, reactive dyes are better employed in other industrial dyeing processes [2]. Dyes are characterized by high
molecular weight and complex chemical structures; hence, they are non-biodegradable [3].
Conventional methods of effluents treatments such as precipitation, electrochemical treatment, reverse osmosis, ion
exchange, evaporation, solvent extraction, as well as adsorption with activated charcoal among others; are presently in usefor the treatment of textile industrial effluent. Adsorption with activated carbon has been found to be effective because ofthe simplicity in its design and operation, ability to adsorb a broad range of pollutants; and fast adsorption kinetics [4].
However, the commercial activated carbon is very expensive due to the high cost of precursor, hence the quest for a more
economical way of textile effluent treatment [5]. Investigations into the use of low cost adsorbent, especially bioresourceContents lists available at ScienceDirect

provided by Landmark University Repositorymaterials as an alternative to commercial activated carbon do not only give economical advantage, it also aids environ-
mental protection and encourages waste management. Waste materials, which naturally would have been nuisance to the
environment; become useful environmental remediation tools. Lignocellulosic materials such as agricultural wastes have
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as their basic constituents. Their polyol backbone coupled with the presence of otherfunctional groups serve as good binding site for pollutants. Although, surface modification or functionalization may resultinto adsorbents with superior adsorption capacity, this however also results in decreased economic advantages [6].
Investigations into the use of various wastes as alternative low cost adsorbent for the treatment of synthetic textile
industrial effluents have been widely reported. Investigation into the use of Cupuassu shells in the uptake of reactive red anddirect blue dyes has been reported. Uptake of dye was more favorable in the acidic media, and equilibrium data was re-
ported to fit best into the Sip isotherm model [7]. Removal of Ramazol black textile dye using pine fruit shell was also
investigated, and reported. Acidic media also favoured the uptake of Ramozol black onto pine fruit shells, while equilibriumadsorption data fitted best into the Sip isotherm model [8]. Bello et al. [9]reported the use of ackee apple seeds in the
removal of Congo Red dye from aqueous solution. Optimum adsorption was observed at pH 3. Adsorption process was fast
and equilibrium was attained within 90 min. The equilibrium adsorption data fitted best into the Langmuir isotherm model.Seed husk of bangal gram was utilized for the removal of congo red, adsorption data obtained were analyzed using Langmuir
isotherm, and q
maxobtained was 41.66 mg/g [10]. Removal of Methylene blue and Eriochrome black T using Maize stem
tissue has been investigated and reported. Maximum monolayer adsorption capacities were reported to be 160.84 mg/g and167.01 mg/g for methylene blue and eriochrome black T respectively. Equilibrium adsorption data for the two dyes, wasdescribed by Freundlcih and Langmuir isotherm models [11]. The use of dika nut endocarp waste in the uptake of Rho-
damine B has also been recently reported. Optimum adsorption was obtained at pH 3, equilibrium adsorption data fitted
best into the Freundlich adsorption isotherm, and maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was obtained to be 212.77 mg/g[12].
Raphia hookerie belongs to the Palmicea family. Members of this family contain high cellulosic fibers, are good source of
carbon, and have been found suitable in activated carbon preparation [13]. While other members of this family have been
well explored in activated carbon preparation as well as effective low cost adsorbent [14–18], Raphia hookerie have been
neglected. To the best of our knowledge, Raphia hookerie epicarp is yet to find applications in environmental remediation.
This study therefore aimed at investigating the potential of low cost adsorbent prepared from the epicarp of Raphia hookerie
fruit in the adsorption of a cationic dye (Rhodamine B- RhB). The physicochemical characteristics, functional groups analysis,and surface morphology of the prepared adsorbents were studied. Studies on the adsorption capacity of the biomaterial viz-
a-viz kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics analysis of the adsorption data, were carried out. The modes and mechanism
of RhB uptake were well investigated and the kinetics models were validated using statistical tools. Economic advantage ofthe prepared adsorbent over modified biomass and commercial activated carbon are also presented.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Adsorbent preparation
Epicarp of Raphia hookerie fruits were collected from local farmers in Mokogi, Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State,
Nigeria. In order to remove dirts, the biomass was washed with abundant water and dried in an oven operated at 105 °C
Fig. 1. Raw Raphia hookerie fruit.A.A. Inyinbor et al. / Water Resources and Industry 15 (2016) 14 –27 15overnight. It was then pulverized and screened into a particle size of 150 –250mm. It was washed, dried and stored in a
closed container. Fig. 1 shows the Raphia hookerie fruits.
2.2. Characterization of the adsorbent
The topography and the elemental composition of the adsorbent were studied using a FEIESEM quanta 200 for SEM and
EDX. The surface area, pore volume and pore size were obtained using a micrometric Tristar II surface area and porosityanalyser. Various functional groups present on the surfaces of the adsorbents were studied using a Bruker ALPHA FTIRspectrophotometer.
2.3. Preparation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution
RhB, with properties listed in Table 1 was supplied by BDH; 1000 mg/L RhB solution was prepared by dissolving accu-
rately weighed samples of RhB in 1 l of deionized water. Serial dilution was done to obtain other desired lowerconcentrations.
2.4. Batch kinetics and equilibrium adsorption studies
Certain parameters greatly affects the adsorption process [19], thus, batch adsorption studies with respect to initial
solution pH (pH 2 –9), initial RhB concentration and contact time (50 –400 mg/L), adsorbent dosage (1 –5 g/L) and tem-
perature (303 –333 K) on the removal of RhB were carried out. The pH of the RhB solution was adjusted by adding 0.1 M HCl
or 0.1 M NaOH. In each adsorption experiment, 0.1 g of the adsorbent (RH) was added to 100 cm
3samples of RhB solution of
a specific concentration in a 250 cm3glass conical flask. The flask was agitated for 50 min in a thermostated water bath
shaker operated at 26 °C and 130 rpm to reach equilibrium. Then the adsorbent was separated from solution by cen-
trifugation. The concentration of unadsorbed dye was determined using a Beckman Coulter Du 730 UV/vis spectro-photometer at 554 nm. Quantity adsorbed at a given time t was calculated using Eq. (1) and percentage removal was
obtained using Eq. (2) :

2.5.1. Isothermal studies
At the equilibrium of an adsorption process, adsorption isotherm is suitable in describing the distribution of adsorbate
molecules between the liquid and the solid phase [20]. Four adsorption isotherms viz: the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and
Dubinin –Radushkevich (D –R) models were used to analyze the adsorption data. Important information such as adsorption
mechanism, favorability of adsorption process and adsorbate-adsorbent affinity may be obtained. The Langmuir isotherm
[21] which assumes a surface with homogeneous binding sites, equivalent sorption energies, and no interactions between
adsorbed species is expressed by the mathematical relation (3);

sorption constant (L/mg ). The plot of C e/qeagainst Cegives a straight line with a slope and intercept of 1/q maxand 1/q maxKL
respectively. K Lis an important tool in the calculation of the dimensionless equilibrium parameters ( RL)that explains the
favorability of adsorption process; R Lis calculated using Eq. (4) .

The Freundlich isotherm [22] that is an empirical model not limited to monolayer coverage alone but also describe
multilayer adsorption. It is expressed mathematically as;
=+() nlog q1log C log K5e ef
where q eis the quantity of RhB adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g ),Ceis the concentration (mg/L) of RhB in solution at
equilibrium; K fand n are Freundlich constants incorporating the factors affecting the adsorption capacity and adsorption
intensity respectively. The Plots of log qeagainst log Cegives a linear graph with slope 1/n and intercept log K ffrom which n
and K fcan be calculated respectively.
Dubinin Radushkevich (D-R) model is a more general model in which assumption is not based on homogenous surface or
constant adsorption potential, it gives insight into the biomass porosity as well as the adsorption energy. The value of
adsorption energy further provides information as to whether adsorption process is physical or chemical in nature [23]. D-R
model is expressed mathematically by Eq. (6) ;
=– β ε () lnq lnq 6 eo2
where q eis the amount of RhB ions adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent (mg/g), q ois the maximum adsorption
capacity, βis the activity coefficient useful in obtaining the mean sorption energy E (kJ/mol) and Ɛis the Polanyi potential. Ɛ
and E are expressed by Eqs. (6a) and (6b) respectively;

where R is the gas constant (J/mol K) and T is the temperature (K). q oandβ(mol2/kJ2) can respectively be calculate from
the intercept and the slope of the plot of lnq evsƐ2.
The Temkin isotherm assumes linear rather than logarithm decrease of heat of adsorption while ignoring extremely low
and very high concentration. It also assumes uniform distribution of bounding energy up to some maximum bondingenergy. It is expressed by Eq. (7) below [24].
=+ () q BlnA BlnC 7 e e
where q eis the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g); Ce is concentration of adsorbate in solution at
equilibrium (mg/L). B is a constant related to the heat of adsorption and it is defined by the expression B ¼RT/b, b is the
Temkin constant (J/mol), T is the absolute temperature (K), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and A is the Temkin
isotherm constant (L/g). From the plot of qe vs. lnCe, B and A can be calculated from the slopes (B) and intercepts (BlnA)
respectively.
2.5.2. Kinetics model
The possible dye adsorption mechanism as well as possible rates controlling steps may be established via kinetics models
[25]. The kinetic of the adsorption systems were studied using the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, Avrami
and fractional power models. The intraparticle diffusion and Bangham models investigated the mechanism of adsorption.A.A. Inyinbor et al. / Water Resources and Industry 15 (2016) 14 –27 17The pseudo first-order kinetic model of Lagergren [26] given by the equation;
()−= − () ln q q lnq k t 8 et e i
where q eis the quantity adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g) and q tis the quantity absorbed at time t (mg/g). k iis the rate
constant for the pseudo-first-order sorption (min/C01). A linear graph with negative slope is expected from the plot of ln (q e–
qt) against t at different concentrations, k iand q calcan then be obtained from the slope and intercept respectively.
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model [27], presented in Eq. (9) ;
() =+ () t/q 1/k q 1 t /q 9 t2 e2
e
where K 2is the rate constant of the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation in g/mg min/C01,qeis the maximum sorption
capacity in mg/g and q t(mg/g) is the amount of sorption at time t. Linear graphs are obtained from a plot of t/q tagainst t
from which q eand k 2can be calculated from the slope and intercepts.
The Elovich kinetic model in its nonlinear and linear form is expressed by the (Eqs. (10) and 11)respectively [28].
() =β α β () t ql n 10 t
() =β α β +β () q1 / l n 1 / l n t 11 t
where q tis the quantity of adsorbate adsorbed at time t (mg/g), αis a constant related to chemisorption rate and βis a
constant which depicts the extent of surface coverage. The two constants ( αandβ) can be calculated from the intercept and
slope of the plot of q tversus lnt respectively.
(Eqs. (12) and 13)express the non linear and linear forms of Avrami kinetic model respectively [29].

KAvis the Avrami constant and n Avis the Avrami model exponent of time related to the change in mechanism of ad-
sorption. K Avand n Avcan be obtained from the intercept and slope of the plot of ln[ /C0ln(1/C0α)] against lnt.
The nonlinear and linear forms of Fractional power kinetic model equation are depicted by (Eqs. (14) and 15)respec-
tively;

=+ () log q log K vlog t 15 t
log K and v are the intercept and slope of the plot of log qt versus log t respectively thus antilog of intercept gives the value
of constant k. v is also a constant that is usually less than unity if adsorption kinetic data fits well into power function model.
qtis the quantity of adsorbate adsorbed at time t.

2.5.3. Adsorption mechanism
The intraparticle diffusion model by Weber and Morris [30] expressed by the mathematical relation in Eq. (18) ;
=+ () qKt C 18 t diff1/2
where q t(mg g/C01) is the amount of RhB dye adsorbed at time t and K diff(mg g/C01min/C01/2) is the rate constant for
intraparticle diffusion. Insight into the thickness of the boundary layer can be obtained from the value of C, large intercept
suggests great boundary layer effect. A plot of q tversus t0.5can give a linear or multilinear suggesting that intraparticle
diffusion is involved in the adsorption process or two or more steps govern the adsorption process. However, if a lineargraph is obtained and the plot passes through the origin then intraparticle diffusion is said to be the sole rate-limiting step.A.A.

2.5.4. Thermodynamic studies
Effects of temperature on the uptake of RhB onto RH was studied, thermodynamic parameters that explains feasibility,
spontaneity and the nature of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions ( ΔG°,ΔH°andΔS°) were calculated using the mathematical

2.6. Desorption of RhB from RH
Mechanism of pollutant uptake as well as reusability of adsorbent can be better understood via desorption experiments.
Leaching/desorption of RhB from RH was investigated using deionized water, 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M CH 3COOH. Fresh ad-
sorbent was loaded with RhB by agitating mixture of 0.1 g and 100 cm3of 100 mg/L RhB solution at pH 3.0 for 1 h. The RhB-
loaded adsorbents were separated by centrifugation and the residual RhB concentration determined spectrophotometrically.
The RhB loaded adsorbents were washed gently with water to remove any unadsorbed dye and dried. The desorptionprocess was carried out by mixing 100 cm
3of each desorbing eluent with the dried loaded-adsorbents and shaken for a
predetermined time and the desorbed RhB was determined spectrophotometrically. Desorption efficiency was calculated
using the mathematical relation below;

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Adsorbents characterization
The topographies and morphologies of RH before and after RhB uptake are presented in Fig. 2 . The surface of RH before
Fig. 2. Surface morphology of RH before RhB dye adsorption (a) and after RhB dye adsorption (b).A.A. Inyinbor et al. / Water Resources and Industry 15 (2016) 14 –27 19adsorption was observed to have large leather like open pores ( Fig. 2 (a)), however the surface was observed to be rough
after RhB uptake. The surface area of RH was observed to be low ( Table 2 ), due to various functional groups which occupies
the surface area of agricultural waste, they are usually characterized by low surface area [31,32]. The affinity of the ad-
sorbent for water was found to be low with percentage moisture content of 0.60% and high carbon content suggests that the
adsorbent will be suitable in the uptake of pollutants.
The surface functional groups of the adsorbent were established using FTIR. The FTIR spectra of RH before and after dye
adsorption are shown in Fig. 3 . Vivid absorption band at 1029.95 cm/C01corresponds to C-OH stretching, while the other
absorption occurring at 1239.09 cm/C01, 1729.93 cm/C01, 2919.82 cm/C01, 1424.27 cm/C01and 3297.82 cm/C01corresponds to C –N
stretching vibrations, C ¼O of amide, C –H stretching vibrations, CH 3bending and O-H of alcohol respectively. The shift of the
various absorption bands to a higher or lower frequency after dye adsorption ( Table 3 ) shows that these functional groups
participated in the uptake of RhB. After RhB adsorption, new peak was also observed at around 1600 cm/C01which corre-
sponds to aromatic ring vibration.Table 2

The pH of the solution greatly influences adsorption process; it determines the surface charge of the adsorbent and the
state of adsorbate in solution. pH effects on the uptake of RhB onto RH was investigated and the highest percentage RhBuptake was obtained at pH 3 ( Fig. 4 ). Rapid adsorption was observed between pH 2 and 3 while percentage adsorption
decreased gradually above pH 3. RhB with pka of 3.7 may exists as cationic, lactonic or zwitterionic form depending on the
solution media. Zwitterionic form of RhB dominates at pH greater than that of RhB pka hence attraction between thexanthene and the carboxyl groups of RhB monomers occurs resulting into RhB dimers and subsequently a decrease in RhBadsorption [33]. Optimum adsorption at pH of 3 has been previously reported by researchers [34]. Subsequent adsorption
studies were carried out at the optimum pH.
3.3. Effects of initial concentration and contact time
Fig. 5 depict the effects of concentration and contact time on RhB uptake onto RH. Quantity of RhB dye adsorbed was
observed to increase with increased time and concentration, RhB uptake was rapid initially and gradually goes to equili-brium with increased time. Quantity adsorbed at equilibrium for initial RhB concentration of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/Lwere 43.5, 85, 166.25, 243.75 and 312 mg/g respectively ( Fig. 5 ). Rapid initial adsorption may be attributed to contacts of
RhB molecules with available surface adsorption sites while subsequent gradual adsorption may be attributed to uptake ofRhB molecules into the pores of the adsorbents. Equilibrium was attained at 40 min for initial dye concentration of 50, 200and 400 mg/L and at 50 min for initial concentration of 100 and 300 mg/L.
3.4. Effects of adsorbent dosage
Percentage adsorbed was observed to increase as the adsorbent dosage increased and equilibrium was attained after
adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L ( Fig. 6 ). Percentage adsorbed increased from 85.19% for adsorbent dosage of 1 g/L to 88.88% for
adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L. Increase in percentage adsorbed with increase in adsorbent dosage between 1 g/L and 2 g/L maybe as a result of increase in the available adsorption sites. Only about 3% increase was observed as adsorbent dosage was
increased from 1 g/L to 2 g/L, overlap of adsorption sites may account for the small increase in percentage adsorption.
However, saturation viz-à-viz aggregation on adsorption site results into equilibrium after 2 g/L dosage ( Fig. 7 ).Table 3

Quantity of RhB adsorbed was found to increase as temperature increased, quantity adsorbed increased from 77.55 to
84.14 mg/g as temperature increased from 30 to 60 °C. Increase in temperature may have generated energy required by large
RhB specie to overcome activation barrier thus more RhB was able to penetrate the adsorbent RH. This study agrees with
some reported works using Kaolinite and Montmorillonite [34].Fig. 5. Effects of contact time and initial dye concentration on RhB adsorption onto RH [Dosage (1 g/L), agitation speed (130 rpm), temperature (26 °C), pH

Table 4 reports the various parameters obtained from the four isotherm plots. Calculated R Lvalue was less than 1 while
the value of n was greater than 1 hence adsorption process was favorable. Freundlich isotherm best described the uptake of
RhB onto RH (R2value of 0.9969), this suggest that adsorption was not onto a uniform site rather a multilayer adsorption
occurred in RhB-RH system. However, monolayer adsorption also played a very important role in the dye uptake onto RH (R2
for Langmuir is 0.9876). The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity for the uptake of RhB onto RH was obtained to be666.67 mg/g, larger percentage of the adsorbed RhB molecules was recorded within the rapid adsorption ( Section 3.3 ,
Fig. 5 ). The Adsorption energy (E) obtained from Dubinin –Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm was 6.11 kJ/mol suggesting that the
uptake of RhB onto RH was by physisorption. Obtained maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (q
max) for the uptake of
RhB onto RH has been compared with q maxfor other adsorbents available in the literatures ( Table 5 ). RH apparently exhibits
higher performance than other adsorbents earlier reported.
3.7. Adsorption kinetics
Calculated parameters of the various kinetics model and the validation results have been reported ( Table 6 ). Low X2and
Δqecharacterized the pseudo second order and the Elovich models suggesting that these two models describe the kinetics
of RhB uptake onto RH. The initial adsorption rate (h) was found to increase as the initial adsorbate concentration increasedsuggesting that there was increase in driving force for mass transfer hence more dye molecule reached the adsorbentsurface within a short period of time.
βElis a constant related to the extension of surface coverage and decreased with
increased in initial adsorbate concentration, the surface area of RH was obtained to be very low ( Table 2 ) hence uptake of
RhB onto RH may have been more through functional groups. However, the constant αElthat is related to chemisorption rate
was found to increase as the initial dye concentration increased, this suggests that more than one mechanism governs theuptake of RhB onto RH [39]. Although the values of constant v obtained for the fractional power kinetic model was observed
to be less than unity suggesting that fractional power may describe the adsorption kinetics of RhB-RH system. The largevalues of X
2andΔqeobtained for fractional power and Avrami kinetic models validates that these two kinetic model does
not describe the kinetics of RhB uptake onto RH. The Bangham and the intraparticle diffusion models clearly show thatmultiple adsorption stages occurred. Correlation coefficient obtained from the Bangham model ranged between 0.9069 and
0.9797 suggesting that pore diffusion was involved in RhB uptake onto RH. However, the linearity of the Bangham plotTable 4

diffusion model plot and this plot did not pass through the origin ( Fig. 8 (f)), this suggests that boundary layer diffusion also
occurred in the uptake of RhB onto RH. While k i1,C1and R2
1are the slope, intercept and correlation of the first steeper
portion, k i2,C2and R2
2indicates the slope, intercept and correlation of the second linear portion respectively. Since the
values of K i1are greater than the observed values of k i2, this indicates that intraparticle diffusion model mainly controlled
the uptake of RhB onto RH.
3.8. Adsorption thermodynamics
Calculated thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of RhB onto RH are reported on Table 7 . Enthalpy ( ΔH°) for RH-
RhB system was positive suggesting that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature. ΔS°also was positive, ( Table 7 ),
suggesting that there was increase in the randomness at the solid-liquid interface during the adsorption of RhB onto RH, theTable 6

molecules as compared to that lost as a result of dye uptake. ΔH°values obtained for the uptake of RhB onto RH was also
found to be less than 40 kJ/mol, this further indicates physical adsorption for RH-RhB system. ΔG°values obtained were
negative ( Table 6 ) suggesting spontaneity of the adsorption process, higher negative values were obtained at higher tem-
perature suggesting that adsorption process at higher temperature was more spontaneous.Fig. 8. Pseudo first order plots for uptake of RhB onto RH (a), Pseudo second order plots for uptake of RhB onto RH (b), Elovich plots for uptake of RhB onto

Desorption efficiencies were generally low ( o25%), H 2O was obtained to have the best desorption efficiency, desorption
efficiency follows the order H 2O4HCl4CH3COOH for the RH-RhB system. Desorption efficiency obtained for RH were
23.81%, 7.94% and 6.35% for H 2O, HCl and CH 3COOH respectively. This result further affirms that uptake of RhB onto RH is via
physisorption. Low percentage desorption of RhB from RH surface may be attributed to a possibility of large net adsorption
energy because of several contact points between large dye molecules and biosorbents [40].
3.10. Cost analysis
RH is a waste thus readily available at no cost, however the cost of transportation for its collection, water and energy for
processing would amount to 0.021 USD/kg (21 USD/ton). Comparing the cost of RH with previous report, chemical activationof readily available adsorbent may result into about 24 times increase in cost while commercial activated carbon is about
1143 times more expensive than RH [41]. Thus RH gives a good economic advantage over modified adsorbents and com-
mercial activated carbon.
4. Conclusion
RH was found to be effective in the uptake of RhB. Optimum adsorption was obtained at pH 3, RhB percentage removal
rose up to 88.88% for adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L. Freundlich isotherm best describe the adsorption of RhB onto RH suggestingthat adsorption was onto a non-uniform site. However initial rapid adsorption was onto a uniform site thus maximummonolayer adsorption capacity was obtained to be 666.67 mg/g. Adsorption energy (E), ΔH°and desorption studies suggests
that the uptake of RhB onto RH was physical in nature. Elovich, Fraction power, Bangham and intraparticle diffusion modelssuggests that more than one mechanism was involved in the uptake of RhB onto RH.
