Abstract . This study reviews the microbial techniques and microbial population responsible for the 
removal of organic matte r and nutrients in constructed wetlands (CWs). In addition, it aims to  analyze the 
effect of presence and absence of macrophytes and identify major phenomena that affect microbial 
community dynamics as well as compares performance efficiency of CW types. R emoval of particular 
pollutants in each CWs type was mainly related with a particular microbial functional group. In CWs the 
dominant bacterial groups were α, β, and γ Proteobacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes 
groups). Microbial dynamics in  subsurface flow are more diverse than in surface flow. Diverse and 
distinct bacterial community inhabits each CW type where different gradients create variable niches in 
which different biochemical processes take place. Vertical flow CWs favor aerobic mic robes and have 
higher removal efficiency for Organic Carbon and ammonium, while HSSF systems favor anoxic and 
anaerobic microbes. Therefore, use of hybrid CWs, design and operational methodologies that enhance 
the activity of the targeted group would bette r optimize performance. CWs with plant species have higher 
microbial density and activities than unplanted. The interaction between plant roots, microorganisms and 
substrates, along the operation time, might have contributed to the establishment of diverse  assemblages 
of microbes CW system.

Introduction  
Constructed wetland systems (CWs) are designed and constructed to mimic natural 
wetland systems which involve the use of wetland plants, substrate (gravel, soil), and 
associated microbial consortia (biofilms) to tr eat almost all kinds of wastewater. They 
are designed to take the same processes that occur in natural wetlands within a more 
controlled environment (Brix and Schierup, 1989; Kadlec and Wallace, 2009; Vymazal , 
2010; Parde et al., 2020 ). CW systems are envi ronmentally friendly treatment methods Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  which can be used for the treatment of industrial, domestic, agricultural wastewater and 
ground water (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009).  
Industrial wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand (COD), high biological 
oxygen de mand (BOD), pesticide, nutrients and high salt content are now possibly 
treated by CWs (Faulwetter et al., 2009; Calheiros et al., 2010; Lv et al., 2016, 2017). 
However, a better understanding of CWs designs and a configuration in order to 
optimize the rem oval of a specific pollutant is still under investigat ion (Faulwetter et al., 
2009). A variety of removal mechanisms including physical (sedimentation, filtration), 
chemical (precipitation, adsorption, volatilization), and biological (microbial 
degradation , microbial nutrient transformation, plant uptake, microbial competition) 
processes are employed in CWs (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Faulwetter et al., 2009; 
Vymazal, 2011).  
However, the removal of most pollutants in CWs is mainly due to microbial 
activity (K adlec and Knight, 1996; Stottmeister et al., 2003; Faulwetter et al., 2009; 
Lv et al., 2017). For example, organic matter and the majority of total nitrogen (TN) 
removal is basically through microbial transformations, while uptake of nutrients by 
plants is  a minor process (Nurk et al., 2005; Kadlec and Knight, 1996). Thus, pollutant 
removal and microbial activity in CWs are closely tied to the cycling of carbon, 
nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Plant root morphology and development and 
substrates in CWs have an effect on wastewater treatment that partially results from 
their effect on bacterial assemblages (Stottmeister et al., 2003; Vymazal et al., 2001) 
and through its influencing microbial -plant interaction (Gagnon et al., 2007; Lv et al., 
2017).  
Early publ ications assumed the influence of microbial processes in CWs, and were  
based primarily on measurement of changes in water quality, and microbial 
identification of OTU (operational taxonomic Unit) but there is a lack of direct evidence 
of specific microbial  groups. Recent advances in qualitative and quantitative microbial 
techniques make direct evidence for the presence of specific microbial species or 
functional groups influencing pollutant removal (Sims et al., 2013). T his paper was 
trying to review  the mi crobial community dynamics and their role in pollutant removal 
efficiencies in each CW type, bacterial populations critical to Sulfur and nitrogen 
removal and/or transformations, pesticide removal and the factors that influence the 
microbial community dyna mics in CW systems (Sims et al., 2013; Ibekwe et al., 2016; 
Lv et al., 2017).

Constructed wetlands  
Wetlands are found at the interface of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in a biome 
spanning from the tundra to the tropics. CW comprises  of a bed of soil, sand or gravel 
which togeth er treat wastewater. Root system of plants and media (soil and gravel) act 
as filters and support biofilms which help in removing contaminates. In addition, plants 
utilize nutrients and bioaccumulation contaminates such as metals. First experiment 
using we tlands with macrophytes for wastewater treatment was carried out in Germany 
during 1950.  Various European countries including the UK adopted  this technology 
during the 1980s . An international conference  on the use of CWs in water pollution  
control  was orga nized in Cambridge in 1990.  Constructed wetlands are classified based  
on vegetation type  (emergent, submerged,  floating leaved, free floating) and hydrology  
(free water surface and sub -surface flow wetland).  
Constructed wetlands, based on its water flow, c an be divided in to two basic types; 
free water surface  flow (FWS) and sub -surface flow (SSF) wetland. SSF  CWs could be 
classified into horizontal and vertical according to the flow direction through a 
permeable medium (typically sand, gravel or crushed ro ck) (Decamp and Warren, 2001 ; 
Vymazal, and Kröpfelová, 2008; Vymazal, 2010; Mina et al., 2011; Parde et al.,  2020). 
Both types utilize wetland/emergent aquatic vegetation and are similar in appearance to 
a natural wetland ( Siti et al., 2011 ). 
In FWS CWs th e water surface is exposed to the atmosphere and flows horizontally 
over the media/soil surface. The mean water depth is usually less than 0.4 m, and thus, 
FWS CWs are frequently dominated by floating, rooted emergent or submersed 
vegetation ( Vymazal, 2010 ). In SSF CWs, the water surface is kept below the surface of 
the substrate, which may support different types of rooted emergent vegetation. In HF 
systems, the influent enters in the bed subsurface at the beginning of the wetland cell 
and flows through ho rizontally using pressure or gravity forces. In vertical flow (VF) 
wetland system the wastewater is fed from the top and then percolated down through 
the filter media (substrate) and gradually collected by collecting drainage system at the 
bottom of the we tland (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009; Parde et al., 2020).  SSF system 
allows for filtration, biodegradation with microbial and plant uptake of contaminants 
(Fig. 1). The benefits of SSF over FWS wetland are odor minimization, control of insect 
vector and gr eater surface area for pollutant treatment ( Table 1 ) (Parde et al., 2020).  
 
Wetland types microbial processes influencing performance of CWS  
The performance of constructed wetlands is based on the combined action between 
microbes, plants, filtering media (Kadl ec and Knight, 1996; Faulwetter, 2009; Vymazal, 
2011), substrate and nutrient availability and loading rates (Truu et al., 2009). The 
mineralization of organic matter is mainly carried out by microbes both in aerobic and 
anaerobic conditions. Removal or tr ansformation of a particular pollutant such as Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and other nutrients in CWs is typically 
associated with a specific microbial group, therefore employment of design and 
operational methodologies that enhance the specif ic activity of that group will improve 
performance (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; Faulwetter et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2015). 
Adsorption and Sulfate reduction is also recognized as an important mechanism for 
metals removal in CW (Dvorak et al., 1992), but the  latter may also play an important 
part in organic carbon (OC) removal. Thus, pollutant removal and microbial activity in 
CWs are closely tied, especially to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur 
compounds (Fu et al., 2011).

Constructed wetland is  also u sed to treat pesticides. Budd et al. (2009) reported that 
organophosphate insecticides removal in CWs rang ed from 52 -94%. Vymazal and

organophosphate pesticide (94%) and Urea based pesticide (50 %). On the other hand, 
the lowest removals were achieved for triazinone pesticide (24%). Rose et al. (2006) 
also reported that CWs designed for pestic ide removal (retention) should comprise of 
both open water and vegetable zones, to increase the potential for complementary 
chemical, microbial, photolytic and plant mediated pesticide break -down. Maillard and 
Imfeld (2014) pointed out Wetland vegetation e nhanced the pesticide removal.  
The treatment efficiency VF CWs (except TN and TP) is relatively more effic ient 
(73-90%) than FWS and SSF CWs ( Fig. 2; Table 2 ). VF CWs allow  unsaturated 
conditions and excellent oxygen transfer, which results in high redox p otentials that 
favor aerobic microbial processes (Houda et al., 2014). Similar studies showed that 
BOD rem oval and nitrification were significantly higher in VF compared to FWS and 
SSF CW ( Table 2 ) (Li et al., 2008; Vymazal, 2007, 2010).

Total phosphorus removal in all types of construct ed wetlands is low (34 -56%) due 
to very low capacity of substrates for sorption and precipitation of phosphorus

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  types of CW systems is also usually low (43 -61%) due to low  nitrification in water -
saturated SSF constructed wetlands and very low denitrification in FWS and VF CWs, 
respectively (Vymazal, 2007; Kadlec a nd Wallace, 2008; Vymazal and Kröpfelová, 
2008; Wu et al., 2013) ( Table 2 ). 
In the free water surface flow const ructed wetland nitrogen is removed via two major 
processes; nitrification and denitrification in aerobic and anaerobic (anoxic) litter layers 
of upper and bottom bed of the CWs, respectively. At VF CWS, very high nitrification 
proceeds, but, because of ent irely aerobic conditions in the vertical bed, no 
denitrification takes place (Vymazal, 2010). To achieve maximum nitrogen removal 
vertical flow CWs should be combined with horizontal Flow CWs.  
Melián et al. (2010) reported that the effects HLR (hydraulic l oading rate) on the 
removal of pollutant in hybrid CW (HSSF followed by VSSF). At the first period of 
application, HLR was 37 mm/d and in the se cond period, HLR was 79 mm/d. Average 
removal efficiency of hybrid CW mainly for NH4+ was higher than in any oth er reports. 
This is may be due to the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic conditions that 
supports both nitrification and denitrification. TN  and TP removal in all types of CW is 
very low ( Fig. 2). COD removal was higher in high HLR mode, but BOD and NH 3 
removal was approximately greater than in high and low HLR mode ( Fig. 2) (Melian et 
al., 2010; Parde et al., 2020).  
Microbial assessment te chniq ues 
To generate information regarding the dynamics and properties of a given microbial 
‘fingerprint ’ or ‘profi le’ in a CW at a given time, there are a number of both classical 
and novel methods available for characterizing microbial communities in the  
environment (Gonzalez et al., 2012). The methods are generally grouped into two; 
culture -dependent (plate count me thod) or molecular -based (culture independent) (Kirk 
et al., 2004; Bernardes et al., 2019).  
 
Culture -dependent techniques  
In this method cert ain living cells are able to grow and replicate on suppling 
biochemical substrates in specific physicochemical envi ronments to evaluate bacterial 
abundance by plate counting techniques. Due to their cost effectiveness, and lower level 
of expertise needed, and the availability of media, the method remains among the most 
popular when measuring fecal contamination and the  presence of pathogens (Morgan et 
al., 2008) ( Table  3). However, the method may be unable to detect viable, but -not-
culturable bacteria, whic h is less than1 -15%, in environmental samples (Oliver, 2005; 
Signoretto and Canepari, 2008). For this reason, there  is a need to use molecular 
methods for the assessment of pathogenic environmental organism (Bernardes et al., 
2019; Fu et al., 2016) . 
 
Molecu lar (culture independent) methods/techniques  
The three most often molecular applied methods are FISH, PCR -DGGE and  
ribosome gene cloning. Phylogenetic information from DGGE is more limited and the 
method is the most suitable for monitoring community succes sion or spatial distribution 
within a particular system while FISH and ribosome gene cloning  allow  the 
determinati on of the presence and abundance of certain microbial populations at Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

the sample. The number of bands corresponds  to the number of dominant species (Sanz 
and Kochling, 2007).  
 
Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA)  
ARDRA also is used to digest  the PCR product amplified from environmental DNA 
using tetra -cutter restriction endonucleases, and restricted f ragments are resolved on 
agarose or polyacrylamide gels.  
In addition, ARDRA is implemented for estimating OTUs and identifying the unique 
clone in environmental clone libraries based on the principle of restri ction of profile  
clones (Smit et al. , 1997). On e of the major limitations of ARDRA is that restriction 
profiles generated from complex microbial communities are sometimes too difficult to 
resolve by agarose (Bernardes et al., 2019)  
 
Terminal -restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)  
T-RFLP are markers randomly distributed throughout the genome of an organism. 
Restriction enzymes are used to digest DNA; followed by electrophoresis. The PCR 
primers used in T -RFLP analysis are fluorescently labelled at the 5′ -terminus and the 
resulting PCR products  are visualised and quantified. T -RFLP depends on differences in 
the sites of restriction position among sequences the lengths  of fluorescently labelled 
fragments of terminal restrict ion gel electrophoresis were determined  by high resolution 
gel electrophoresis on an automated DNA sequence (Chikere, 2013).  
 
Staining techniques  
Quantification of bacterial cells or communities, can be performed by us ing staining 
techniques such as staini ng with 4 ’,6-diamido -2-phenylindole (DAPI), viability staining, 
fluorescent antibodies, green fluorescent protein or fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH). The DAPI and FISH staining technique s were widely used for  publication.

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  
FISH is a phylogenetic staining technique which makes use of fluorescent 
oligonucleotide probes (DNA or RNA oligonucleotide attached to a fluorescent dye) 
complementary in base sequence to determine  bacterial genome (Amann et al. , 1995 ; 
Faulwetter  et al., 2009). These phylogenetic probes can penetrate and hybridize with 
bacterial ribosomal RNA through different procedures, and the targeted bacterial cells 
fluoresce according to the dye used. By using fluorescence or confocal microscopy,  
the presence of the targeted microorganisms can be  shown and enumeration of cells 
can be performed (Schmidt et al., 2002; Leta et al., 2004 ; Caltereiros et al., 2010). The 
most common microbial techniques used to assess  microbial community in CWs and 
their advantage and disadvantage inherent to each microbial method is summarized in 
Table  3. 
 
Microbial activity detection  
Microbial activity refers to a measure of the microbial driven biological processes 
occurring in a CW.  Microbial activity can be measured  by situ, mostly by measuring a 
specific gas production  (e.g. CO 2, N 2, CH 4) enzyme production, metabolic capacity 
(Faulwetter et al., 2009). An estimation of the production or consumption of enzymes 
used in various biolog ical processes important for wastew ater treatment can shed light 
on those processes. Targeting specific enzymatic activities can help to better 
understand degradation mechanisms of a variety of pollutants and specific pathways 
within the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur transformatio ns in CWs (Wu et  al., 
2011; Fu et al., 2016). Community -Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) method also 
allows  a relatively quick and cost -effective analysis of the metabolic capacity, or the 
carbon source utilization pat tern (CSUPs), of the microbial comm unity (Cristea et al., 
2014).  
There is a little need for isolation, amplification processing or enrichment of 
dilution, re -suspension and centrifugation (Calbrix et al ., 2005). Creation of a CLPP is 
done through the use o f BIOLOG™ ECOplates™ (by Biolog Inc .) which contain 96 
wells, three blanks along with 31 carbon sources in triplicate (Weber and Legge, 
2010; Ramírez -Vargas et al., 2020). This method measures the ability or rate of a 
given microbial community to metaboliz e carbon. CSUPs or metabolism diffe rence is 
expressed in terms of richness, evenness and diversity (Gonzalez et  al., 2012). The 
major limitation of CLPP is that it is not able to provide a reliable picture of the 
community structure; because it is unknown whether or not carbon utilization i s due to 
a single species or is a result of cooperation among microbes (Gonzalez et al., 2012).  
Microbial community dynamics in constructed wetlands  
CWs are a mysterious assemblage of microorganisms which includes bact eria, 
viruses, protozoa, fungi, algae and other  microscopic organisms. However, the use of 
the term ‘microbial community ’ dynamics refers to the consortia of various bacterial 
populations in CWs. Microbial community composition, type, size and dynamics are  
the key factors for efficient wastewa ter treatment in CW systems (Faulwetter et al., 
2009). The influent wastewater, with its native microbial species, is flowing through 
the wetland matrix (gravel, root, soil). A portion of these microbial populations ar e 
attached to this matrix and assemble  in a biofilm. Biofilms varies in terms of Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  biological and chemical compositions depending on the type of treated wastewater, 
CW types and plant species (Truu et al., 2009; Qiaohong et al., 2009). For this reason, 
the m icrobial community composition of diff erent biofilms is relatively unknown and 
usually considered a black box (Samaso and Garica, 2013). Analysis of influent and 
effluent chemical parameters and microbial dynamics in CW treatment indicates that 
there are c onsortia microbial activities involved  in the treatment processes. The 
presence of plants in CW also enhances microbial diversity and its activity (Ibekwe et 
al., 2007). As a result, the plant species, development, oxygen uptake and root 
morphology seem to  be a key factor influencing microbial -plant interactions (Gagnon 
et al., 2007) and biofilm population and its density (Vymazal et al., 2001; Fu et al.,  
2016).  
Microbial communities are active in aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic zones of CWs. 
In the sediment s, gravel or soil, as the oxido -reduct ion potential decreases with depth, 
the succession of microbial community with increasing depth is: denitrificati ng, iron 
reduc ing, sulfate reduc ing, methano genic microbes (Kadlec et al., 2002; Caltheiros 
CSC et al., 2 009). Since wetlands are producing met hane (CH 4) to the atmosphere, 
methanogens play an important role in BOD reduction in wastewater effluents. In CW 
systems a variety of bacteria originating from different phyla were found (Ahn et al., 
2007; Yan et al.,  2017). The microbial community of the wetland sediment was 
dominated by α -proteobacteria (48 –60% of the clones) and second in abundance 
bacteria were related to Actinobacteria  and Firmicutes  (Ahn et al., 2007). A direct 
microbial measurement study has shown that the microbial density and activi ty were 
maximized in the first 5 –10 cm of the vertical flow filter (Tietz et al., 2007). The 
ample oxygen supply and high nutrient contents in the upper zone of vertical flow 
CWs causes the higher abundance of microorganism (Wu et al., 2006; Tietz et al., 
2007; Bernardes et al.,  2019).  
Most functional biological WWT systems depend on naturally occurring 
microorganisms that are responsible for the organic carbon degradation and nutrient 
cycling (Daims et al., 2006). Microbial biofilms attached to the CW matr ix (plant root, 
gravel and solid particles), are responsible for most of the biological transformations 
and decompositions of contaminants in the wastewater (Wuetz, 2003; Faulwetter et 
al., 2009). According to Ibekwe et al. (2007) the majority of obtained sequence from 
sediment and rhizosphere samples of SF CW belongs to unclassified taxa, while the 
second dominant group consists of proteobacteria  members ( Table 2 ). The very 
dynamic and variab le nature of a wetland system is a result of different gradient o f 
redox  conditions , substrate availability, and environmental conditions such as oxygen, 
pH and temperature (Milenkovski, 2009). The different gradient creates variable 
niches through the vertical and longitudinal section of the wetlands, in which differen t 
biochemical processes take place (Scholz and Lee, 2005). A study by Truu et al. 
(2005) also showed that wetland depth affected the microbial community structure  of 
the biofilm with respect to communities of bacteria (ammonia oxidizing bacteria and 
Archae a bacteria).  
Studies on the microbial diversity from CW treating high salinity tannery WW also 
reported the presence of bacterial isolates p hylogenetically related to Firmicutes, 
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, α, β, and γ Proteobacteria  (Calheiros et al., 2009). 
Similarly, a study by Calheiros et al. (2009) and Lefebvre et al. (2006) on the 
microbial diversity from CW treating tannery wastewater reported the presence of 
bacterial isolates belonging to the α - and γ -Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  Actinobacteri a and Bacteroidetes  groups. Aguilar et al. (2008) performed a study on 
the characterization of Sulphur oxidizing bacteria in wetland treating tannery 
wastewater and reported bacterial isolates with similarities to α, β, and γ -
Proteobacteria  subgroups and affiliated with Actinobacter spp (Table 4 ). Sequence 
analysis of bands excised from DGGE derived from bacterial 16S rRNA extracted 
from wetland sediment, rhizo -sphere plants, and surface water ( Table  4) showed that 
the different niches of CWs have its own microbial population. In CW sediments δ -
proto bacteria are dominant (14.3%). However, the dominant bacterial groups in 
rhizosphere and water phase are γ–Proteobacteria (45%)  and Cyanobacteria (16%)  
respectively  (Table 4 ) (Ibekwe  et al.,  2007). Microbial bi omass C/N ratio is higher in 
horizontal flow systems compared to vertical flow systems, indicating the structural 
differences in microbial communities between those two constructed wetland types 
(Ibekwe  et al.,  2007 ; Fu et al.,  2016).  
Modeling results on s patial distribution of microbes in CWs also showed that there 
are dominant microbial populations in each vertical and longitudinal section (Samso 
and Garcia, 2013). A fermentation bacterium occupies the inlet position, 
Heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria  on the top and methanogens and SRB occupies 
the bottom sediments ( Fig. 3).

Factors affecting microbial community (bio film development)  
Microbial biomass and activities of different wetland systems were influenced by 
organic matter, surface property, depth (Tietz et al., 2007) and vegetation. Lv et al. 
(2017) conclude that season, the presence of plants and species of wet land plant s were  
the main drivers for defining microbial community in saturated CWs system. The 
presence of plants defined the carbon source utilization pattern of the microbial Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

carbon sources utilization patterns probably because of environmentally induced 
changes in plant as well as microbial activity.  
The physical and chemical properties of the wetland systems may also influence 
biofilm biomass, its assembly and function.  The type of substrate and the presence of 
plants seemed to have a major effect on the dynamics and diversity of the bacterial 
community (Gagnon et al., 2007; Vymazal et al., 2001). The root zone (rhizosphere) of 
CWs is the active reaction zone where the b iological and physicochemical processes 
take places, induced by  the soil, interaction of plant  pollutants  and microorganisms. 
According to Gagnon et al. (2007) CWs with plant species always had a higher 
microbial density and activities than unplanted contr ols. Microbial activities were ten 
times higher on root surfaces compared with sands (Wang et al., 2014). The differences 
in root and shoot morphology between plant species are key factor s influencing 
microbial density and activity. Studies showed that oxy gen release rates by plants are 
strongly correlated to the above ground biomass. According to Gagnon et al. (2007) 
Phalaris had the highest above ground biomass, the greatest number of stems per 
microcosm and the highest root surface. The high microbial de nsity in Phalaris is due to 
root oxygen release and high aerobic respiration rates. Higher microbial density and 
activity associated with Phalaris was may be due to its rapid growth rate, passing from 4 
to 88 stems on average per microcosm during the first  growing season (Gagnon et al., 
2007 ; Bernardes et al., 2019).  
However, the variations introduced in the systems in terms of hydraulic loading rates 
did not result in substantial changes in the diversity of the microbial communities along 
the systems opera tion (Stottmeister et al., 2003). The substrate is an important wetland 
component since it supports plant growth, establishment of microbial biofilms and 
influences the hydraulic processes (Stottmeister et al., 2003). The other important 
spatial pattern in  microbial community structure within the CW was related to the depth 
gradient. There is a significant difference in bacterial community structure between the 
upper and deeper layers; where the diversity of the bacterial community was higher in 
the upper l ayer than in the deeper horizon (Mina et al., 2011). In terms of CFU/ml there 
is a significant difference between the wastewater inlet and the outlet of CW (Calheiros 
et al., 2009).  
Comparison of constructed wetland C/N ratio microbial biomass, showed that 
horizontal flow systems ha ve higher microbial biomass compared to Vertical flow 
system (Ibekwe et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2017). Many factors can affect microbial sulfur 
cycling in CWS including carbon availability, the presence of more energetically 
favor able elements and redox conditions (Faulwetter et al., 2009 ; Fu et al., 2016). 
Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are among the most ubiquitous organisms on the planet 
(Faulwetter et al., 2009) and most abundant of all groups (40%) in CW systems. These 
organi sms utilize sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor in the anaerobic oxidation of 
organic substrates (Liamleam, and Annachhatre, 2007; Bernardes et al., 2019). The 
relative concentration of sulfate to other electron acceptor compounds will determine 
which microbial processes are occurring in anaerobic conditions.  
For instance, denitrification is energetically more suitable with sulfate reduction 
presences after the entire  nitrate has been avoided  (Whitmire and Hamilton,  2005) and 
methanogens compete with su lfate reducing bacteria at similar redox level for available 
carbon (Omil et al ., 1998). It has been shown that oxygen released from the roots may 
be used to re -oxidize reduced metabolites formed in the sulfur and iron cycles (Brune et Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater: 
a review  
- 2681 - 
APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH 19(4):2667 -2687 .

© 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary  al., 2000 ; Qing yan et al., 2017). Methanogens and sulfate -reducing bacteria may 
compete for the same electron donors, acetate and H2 at the bottom sediments and 
anaerobic region (Liamleam, and Annachhatre, 2007).  
The report of research on the growth of kinetics of Methanogen s and sulfate -
reducing bacteria shows that sulfate -reducing bacteria have a higher affinity (Ks 1 /4 
9.5 mg/l) than methanogens (Ks 1 /4 9.5  mg/l) for acetate substrate (Hansen, 1994). This 
indicates that sulfate -reducing bacteria can out -compete methanogens  under low acetate 
concentrations. This competitive inhibition results in the shunting of electrons from 
methane generation to sulfate reduction (McFarland and Jewell, 1990 ; Fu et al., 2016). 
Damgaard et al. (2001) use d a 30 mm diameter methane -microsensor , and reported that 
the presence of 2 mmole /L sulfate, and the use of H  (hydrogen) as an electron dono r, 
inhibited Methanogenesis activity. Methanogenes and sulfate reducers are very 
competitive at the 1.7 to 2.7 COD /SO4 ratios. An increase of this ratio i s favorable to 
methanogens, whereas a decrease in the ratio is favorable to sulfate reducers (Choi and 
Rim, 1991).  
Conclusion  
Recent CW treatment research results generally confirmed the existence of the 
appropriate microbial functional groups, e.g. nitrif iers, denitrifie rs, methanogens, SRB 
and SOB, which are responsible for the removal of specific pollutants. There is a 
diverse and distinct bacterial community inhabits in each CW type where the different 
gradient creates variable niches in which diffe rent biochemical processes take place. VF 
systems favor aerobic microbial populations while HSSF systems favor anoxic and 
anaerobic microbes. Uses of hybrid CWs enhance higher removal efficiency due to the 
integration of all redox conditions which can support various microbial functional 
groups. The types of plant, substrate, redox conditions, organic matter and substrates 
have an effect on the composition of bacterial communities in CWs. CW with 
vegetation has higher microbial density and activities than unpla nted ones. However, 
the different hydraulic loading rates did not result in significant changes in the microbial 
communities and removal efficiencies. The interaction between plant roots, 
microorganisms and substrate, along operation time, might have contr ibuted to the 
establishment of diverse assemblages. Over time, in CW systems,  anaerobic bacteria 
dominated over aerobic bacteria in terms of total biomass. Sulfate reducing bacteria 
were the most abundant of all groups. Based on reviewing the recent CW tre atment 
research findings, information on functional groups of microbes in CW is lacking.  
 
The way fo rward  
The reviewed results provide a snapshot of the composition and structure of 
microbial community dynamics in the constructed wetland for the treatment o f agro -
industrial and domestic wastewater. In order to have conclusive information on the 
microbial community population dynamics playing key roles in the removal of these 
pollutants, the following key points were recommending:  
• It is important to perform a  longitudinal investigation of microbes in each 
component of the treatment system as part of a routine measurement of biotic 
and abiotic factors over time.  Engida et al. : Microbial community dynamics and activity in constructed wetland treating agro -industrial and domestic wastewater:

structure and activity in constructed wetlands there is a need for high resolution 
sampling strategies for estimating spatial variation of microbial parameters  
• It is impossible  to make any overall conclusions about the wetlands microbial 
community structure dynamics  or in its opera tional parameters and relation t o 
removal process. Future r esearch is vital to link microbial community 
composition, action, and function, combining genotyping systems with activity 
measurements, in order to reliably estimate the many of bacterial species,  
associate bacterial communities within and among constructed wetlands, and 
relate community structure to environmental parameters.
