Lachlan William Scott Strain  iii  ABSTRACT 
Greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata ) are a highly valued fishery resource, grown in 
aquaculture facilities around the southern states o f Australia. These commercial farms 
have a nursery system that utilises natural algal d iets adhered to vertical plates for 
rearing postlarval and juvenile abalone. However, a s the juvenile abalone grow  
(5 – 15 mm shell length), the current commercial nu rsery diet of the green alga Ulvella 
lens  plus the diatom Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  does not supply adequate algal biomass to 
maintain commercially viable abalone growth rates a t the required stocking densities. 
The focus of this research was to identify, develop  and evaluate alternative macroalgal 
diets to overcome the restrictions in algal biomass  during the later nursery phase. 
 
Macroalgae as an alternative natural diet for juven ile abalone can increase the algal 
biomass supplied on the vertical plates given its f ast, 3-dimensional growth; while also 
considered a suitable nutrition source, as it is th e primary feed of wild adult abalone. 
Australian abalone species have a preference for re d macroalgae and to accommodate 
this, propagation methods including carpospore libe ration, protoplast production and 
vegetative propagation; were assessed to determine the fitness of Rhodophyta species as 
an alternative diet for juvenile abalone in the lat er nursery phase. Protoplasts were 
readily isolated from red macroalgal species, howev er due to their limited regeneration, 
high cost of production and significant expertise r equired, the method was deemed 
unsuitable for utilisation in a commercial abalone nursery. 
 
Vegetative propagation successful established fragm ent culture of several red 
macroalgal species. The development of an artificia l adhesion protocol, utilising active 
immobilisation processes through gel entrapment by the natural polysaccharide agar; 
enabled macroalgal fragments to be presented to juv enile abalone on the vertical plates 
in the nursery system. A diet of Laurencia  sp. fragments adhered to the plates with agar 
produced juvenile abalone growth rates (50 µm.day -1) comparable to the current 
commercial nursery diet of U. lens  and N.  jeffreyi . The grazing resistance of the 
Laurencia /agar diet was low and fragments did not regenerate ; so regular re-application  iv was required, making artificial adhesion protocols unsuitable for use in the development 
of juvenile abalone diets within the nursery system . Instead of integrating alternative 
macroalgal diets in the nursery system, a different  abalone management (weaner) 
system utilising an artificial diet, was able to pr oduce significantly greater juvenile 
abalone growth rates and weight gain for abalone la rger than 8 mm shell length. 
 
Macroalgal sporelings were incorporated as an alter native diet to remove the need for 
artificial adhesion protocols, as they can be seede d directly onto the plates whilst still 
presenting high algal biomass to the juvenile abalo ne. The morphology and life cycle of 
the green alga, Ulva  allows for the high spore production and sporeling  densities 
required to create a juvenile abalone diet. An Ulva  spp. sporeling diet on the nursery 
plates produced abalone growth rates of nearly 100 µm.day -1 and was comparable to the 
current commercial nursery diet ( U. lens /N. jeffreyi ). However, the Ulva  sporeling diet 
was unable to maintain suitable growth rates for ab alone greater than 8 – 9 mm shell 
length and consequently, did not overcome the bioma ss limitation of natural algal diets 
in the nursery system. 
 
Given the Ulva  sporeling diets ability to produce commercially vi able growth rates for 
juvenile abalone less than 8 – 9 mm shell length an d Australian abalone preference for 
red macroalgae, a composite green and red macroalga l sporeling diet was identified as 
an alternative diet for juvenile abalone in the lat er nursery phase. To incorporate 
Rhodophyta species into the diet, propagation via c arpospore liberation was achieved 
for several red macroalgal species by temperature, dark and osmotic pressure induction 
treatments, with Hypnea  sp. liberating the greatest number of carpospores  
(67.23 ± 10.19 x10 3 carpospores.g -1). Therefore, the combination Hypnea  and Ulva  
sporeling diet was developed, which also reduced th e biomass of red macroalgal 
carposporophyte required compared to that needed fo r creating a monospecies diet. This 
composite sporeling diet produced larger juvenile a balone (15 mm shell length), faster 
growth rates (87 µm.day -1) and weight gain (2.5 µg.day -1), when compared to the 
current commercial diets in the nursery ( U. lens /N. jeffreyi ) and weaner (artificial feed) 
systems. The addition of new seeded plates for all nursery diets during the trial allowed 
the composite sporeling diet to provide sufficient algal biomass. The Hypnea /Ulva   v sporeling diet was able to overcome the biomass lim itations of algal diets and 
accommodate the juvenile abalone (<15 mm shell leng th) high grazing pressure, while 
producing commercial viable growth rates throughout  the entire later nursery phase. 
This composite sporeling diet has been incorporated  into a detailed feeding regime for 
Australian commercial abalone nursery practices, to  help improve juvenile Haliotis 
laevigata  culture and increase overall farm production of th is highly valued resource.

 Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 1 CHAPTER 1 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Abalone are marine molluscs within the class Gastro poda, family Haliotidae, 
and typified by a flattened, calcareous shell cover ing a large muscular foot that adheres 
the animal to the substrata. Species of the genus Haliotis  are widely distributed 
throughout the exposed coastal waters of the Pacifi c, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, from 
the tropics to cold temperate regions (Nash 1991, C astell 2003). Abalone are found 
along these diverse coastlines, inhabiting the inte rtidal zone from just below the low-
tide mark to depths of approximately 40 metres (Hah n 1989a). The habitat’s exposure to 
human activity has allowed extensive harvesting of abalone species for their muscular 
foot, which are considered a delicacy around the wo rld (Landau 1992, Castell 2003). 
However, only a small percentage of abalone species  are currently commercially 
exploited, with Australia’s coastal waters home to three major, commercially harvested 
abalone: Haliotis laevigata  (Greenlip), Haliotis rubra  (Blacklip) and Haliotis roei  
(Roe’s) (Shepherd 1973, Castell 2003). 
 
As an economically important genus, abalone have a slow and heterogeneous 
growth rate of approximately 2 – 3 cm.y -1 (Hahn 1989b). This growth rate has generally 
been described by the von Bertalanffy growth curve (e.g. Shepherd & Hearn 1983, 
Keesing & Wells 1989), however due to variation in Haliotis  species growth between 
life stages, alternative growth models such as the Gompertz growth curve can be fitted 
(Troynikov  et al.  1998, Bardos 2005). Juvenile abalone have been sho wn to exhibit 
linear growth trends (Shepherd  et al.  1992), even when there was a distinct seasonal 
effect present (Helidoniotis & Haddon 2012). Recent ly, an inverse logistic growth 
model has been recommended, which caters for the li near growth in juveniles while also 
modelling growth across the entire size range of ab alone (Haddon  et al.  2008, 
Helidoniotis  et al.  2011). The variation in growth rates over the life  span of an abalone 
can not solely be attributed to the different stage s of abalone development, as the 
weather, season, localised areas, abalone density a nd food availability can all vary an 
individual animals growth (Day & Fleming 1992, Troy nikov  et al.  1998). Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 2 1.1 ABALONE NUTRITION 
Abalone are generalist, unselective herbivores that  graze on hard surfaces for 
algae as juveniles and capture drift algae as adult s (Landau 1992). The algal diet an 
abalone consumes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including food availability, 
avoidance of chemical deterrents and digestibility of foods (Fleming 1995a). Given 
these factors impact the food intake of abalone and  the algal diet itself has a different 
nutritional profile to their animal tissue, nutrien t limitations can occur (Fleming 1992) 
The energy content and biochemical nature of consum able nutrients in algae, coupled 
with the herbivores ability to obtain these nutrien ts from algae can be of important 
dietary consequence and may contribute to the slow growth rate present in natural 
abalone populations. 
 
Examining the diet of early life stage abalone (set tled, postlarvae and juvenile) 
shows they tend to consume epiphytic and epilithic diatoms, extra cellular products, 
crustose coralline algae, turf algae, mucus and bac teria as major dietary components, 
until the dietary intake becomes dominated by macro algae (e.g. Garland  et al.  1985, 
McShane  et al.  1994, Kawamura  et al.  1995, Kawamura & Takami 1995, Kawamura 
1996, Takami  et al.  1998, Dunstan  et al.  2002). The feeding and growth of postlarval 
and juvenile abalone can be categorised into three distinct dietary transitions. 
 
1) Lecithotrophy and dissolved organic matter absor ption from seawater to 
particulate feeding. 
2) Change in digestibility of diatom diets for post larval abalone at 600 to  
800 µm shell length. 
3) Biofilm-dominated diet to macroalgae-dominated d iet at approximately 5 to 
10 mm shell length. 
(Kawamura  et al.  1998b, Takami & Kawamura 2003) 
 Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 3 1.1.1 Lecithotrophy and dissolved organic matter ab sorption from seawater to 
particulate feeding. 
Abalone have a lecithotrophic, planktonic larval st age (days) and do not possess 
a functional mouth or digestive tract (Levinton 199 5). The larvae’s primary energy 
source of yolk reserves can be supplemented through  the uptake of dissolved organic 
matter (DOM) from ambient seawater (Manahan & Jaeck le 1992, Kawamura  et al.  
1998b, Takami  et al.  2000, Roberts  et al.  2001). Once the larvae have settled and 
metamorphosed, the postlarvae transition from the e nergy sources of yolk and DOM to 
particulate food at around 400 – 500 µm shell length (Takami  et al.  2000, Roberts  et al.  
2001). Particulate feeding generally includes the i ngestion of diatom extra cellular 
products, mucus, bacteria and other components of t he biofilm (Kawamura 1996). This 
transition does not necessarily occur immediately a fter metamorphosis as the digestive 
system of postlarval abalone may not yet be complet ely developed and therefore, unable 
to fully utilise different feeds (Manahan & Jaeckle  1992, Martínez-Ponce & Searcy-
Bernal 1998, Roberts  et al.  1999a). 
 
In the natural environment abalone species are repo rted to preferentially settle 
and metamorphose on crustose coralline algae (CCA) (McShane 1992, Roberts 2001). 
Different species and growth forms of CCA can influ ence the settlement of abalone 
larvae, particularly through the variation in CCA s urface characteristics (McShane 
1996, Daume  et al.  1999a, Roberts  et al.  2004). It’s understood that CCA itself, and not 
the surface biofilm of associated diatoms and bacte ria, are considered the source of 
settlement cues for temperate abalone larvae (Rober ts  et al.  2010). Although, diatom 
species can cue rapid larval settlement, few induce  consistently strong metamorphosis; 
therefore diatom films generally produce considerab le variation in the density of 
abalone post settlement (Roberts  et al.  2007). 
 
Crustose coralline algae can also be a suitable par ticulate feed, especially the 
cuticle and epithelial cell contents (McShane 1992,  Kawamura  et al.  1995, Takami  et al.  
1997a, Daume  et al.  1999b). The exact dietary value of CCA may differ between 
species but in general, if grazing has been heavy, the cytoplasmic content of the Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 4 epithallium can become the nutritional basis for po stlarval abalone (Garland  et al.  1985, 
Shepherd & Daume 1996, Takami  et al.  1997a). The presence of biofilm components, 
specifically diatoms and their extra cellular produ cts, on the surface of CCA tend to 
produce significantly higher growth rates than just  the cuticle and epithelial cell 
contents of CCA (Takami  et al.  1997a, Daume  et al.  2000). 
 
The trail of mucus left by abalone during grazing h as been shown to produce 
elevated levels of postlarval survival and may indi cate gastropod mucus could be 
nutritionally important (Slattery 1992, Takami  et al.  1997b). Takami et al.  (1997b) 
showed that postlarvae feeding on the mucus trail o f abalone were able to grow up to 
700 µm in shell length, which was compatible with anothe r study on the growth 
obtained by postlarvae consuming the extra cellular  mucus of the diatoms Navicula 
ramosissima  and Stauroneis constricta  (Kawamura & Takami 1995). However, for 
postlarval abalone greater than 700 µm shell length, a mucus diet consisting of protein 
and polysaccharides with low C:N ratio was not suff icient to support high growth rates 
(Peduzzi & Herndl 1991, Takami  et al.  1997b). Therefore, mucus as a nutrition source 
may be become inadequate as the postlarvae grows, b ut does provide an excellent 
medium for bacterial growth (Takami  et al.  1997b). These bacteria colonies can be used 
as a nutritional food source forming a minor compon ent of the postlarval diet, but are 
also thought to perform metabolic functions in the gut aiding in the digestion process 
(Garland  et al.  1985, Kawamura  et al.  1998b). Most of these ingestible bacteria are 
cocco-bacilli from the genus Moraxella  and generally reflect the bacterial biota of the 
CCA surface (Garland  et al.  1985). 
 
1.1.2 Change in digestibility of diatom diets for p ostlarval abalone at 600 to 800 µµ µµm 
shell length. 
Rapid growth rates are achievable on yolk and DOM u ptake, as well as 
particulate feeding of biofilm components including , CCA, trail mucus and bacteria, 
until the postlarvae are approximately 700 µm in shell length (Roberts  et al.  2001). 
Diatoms and particularly their extra cellular produ cts, are an important part of the 
particulate feed and can be consumed from the secon d day after metamorphosis Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 5 (Martínez-Ponce & Searcy-Bernal 1998). However, the  species and digestibility of the 
diatoms ingested does not significantly affect the growth rates obtained during this early 
postlarval stage as long as there are adequate supp lies of biofilm material (Kawamura & 
Takami 1995, Kawamura  et al.  1998a). Conditions and diatom species that have be en 
shown to induce good settlement rates often support  good early postlarval survival and 
growth (Daume  et al.  1999b, Gordon  et al.  2006). 
 
The efficiency at which an abalone can digest diato ms has two key components, 
ingestibility and digestibility once ingested. Inge stibility can be associated with the ease 
at which diatoms are removed from the substrata and  swallowed, based on 
characteristics such as cell morphology, attachment  and structural strength (Roberts  et 
al.  1999a, 2001). Diatom cell morphology includes cell  size and growth form, which 
can both limit diatoms digestion by precluding inge stion altogether (Kawamura  et al.  
1998a). Cell size can be considered an important fa ctor as diatoms smaller than the 
postlarval mouth are likely to have high ingestion rates while large diatom species will 
have very inefficient ingestion (Fleming  et al.  1996, Roberts  et al.  1999a). 
 
Attachment strength conveys how firmly the diatoms are connected with the 
substratum. Diatom species with high attachment str ength require force to be removed 
and are usually broken if dislodged, while diatoms with low attachment strength tend to 
be ingested without any deformation or rupture (Kaw amura  et al.  1995, 1998a, 1998b). 
The majority of ingested cells pass unbroken (low a ttachment strength) and these 
particular diatoms provide very little nutritional benefit compared with the high 
attachment strength diatoms (Kawamura  et al.  1995, 1998a). 
 
Structural strength of diatoms relates to the stren gth of the frustules. Some 
diatom species with low attachment strengths are st ill able to produce high digestion 
efficiencies and good growth rates, through the abi lity of postlarval abalone to rupture 
their weak silica frustules (Kawamura  et al.  1995, 1998a, 1998b). Postlarvae cannot 
digest diatom cell contents in their alimentary can al without first physically rupturing Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 6 the frustule and/or girdle elements (Kawamura  et al.  1995). Rupture of the frustules 
frequently results from contact with the radula or from rotation within the stomach. This 
process of rupturing the frustules on grazing can b e considered one of the most 
important factors in determining a diatom’s dietary  value and whether the cells contents 
can be metabolised (Kawamura  et al.  1995). These two diatom strength characteristics 
directly affect the ability of postlarval abalone t o digest the diatom cell contents and 
subsequently produce variation in the nutritional v alue of different diatom species. 
 
Dietary benefits of diatoms tend to depend on the s ize of the abalone, as the 
differences between the nutritional value of differ ent diatom species become apparent 
when postlarvae grow to over 800 µm shell length (Daume  et al.  2000, Gordon  et al.  
2006). To maintain the growth rates associated with  smaller postlarvae on diatoms with 
variable digestibility, the larger postlarval abalo ne require high levels of digested 
diatom cell contents (Kawamura  et al.  1998b). Once the postlarvae reach a size  
(1 – 2 mm shell length) where they can efficiently ingest diatoms and digest the cell 
contents, growth rates of 40 – 60 µm.day -1 can be supported (Kawamura  et al.  1998a, 
1998b). Therefore, diatom selection during grazing by postlarval abalone can be highly 
important in securing the correct nutritional requi rements to improve growth and 
survival (Viana  et al.  2007). 
 
1.1.3 Biofilm-dominated diet to macroalgae-dominate d diet at approximately 5 to 
10 mm shell length. 
Prior to the consumption of macroalgae, the dominan t components in the natural 
benthic biofilm of diatoms and their extra cellular  secretions (mucus) are considered the 
primary food source for juvenile abalone (Kawamura  et al.  1995, Kawamura 1996, 
Kawamura  et al.  1998b). Once the abalone reach 4 to 5 mm shell len gth (juveniles), 
diatoms alone are no longer sufficient to maintain the nutrition of postlarval abalone 
(Daume & Ryan 2002, Takami  et al.  2003). The nutritional requirements of juvenile 
abalone therefore, begin to shift from a biofilm-do minated diet to a macroalgae-
dominated diet at around 5 – 10 mm shell length (Mc Shane  et al.  1994, Kawamura  et al.  
1995, Dunstan  et al.  2002). Crustose coralline algae have been shown to  be the principle Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 7 feed for juveniles of 5 – 10 mm shell length, with the transition to erect macroalgae and 
drift algae occurring as they reach 20 mm shell len gth (Shepherd & Cannon 1988). 
However, this dietary transition can occur across a  highly varied juvenile abalone size 
range and may be dependent on food availability and  composition (Kawamura  et al.  
1998b, Takami & Kawamura 2003). 
 
These three dietary transitions between nutrition s ources, particularly the shift 
from diatoms to macroalgae, are considered closely related to the ontogenetic changes 
in digestive enzyme activity and radula morphology of postlarval and juvenile abalone 
(Takami & Kawamura 2003). Abalone species such as Haliotis discus hannai  that 
prefer to feed on brown algae as adults, have detec table polysaccharide-degrading 
enzyme activity by 17 d post settlement and exhibit  a rapid increase in enzyme activity 
with growth after 37 d, indicating that even during  the postlarval stage (settlement –  
2 mm shell length) enzymes for brown macroalgae fee ding have been produced in the 
digestive tract (Takami  et al.  1998). The structural and functional changes in th e radula 
that occur by 4 mm shell length for this abalone sp ecies, suggest that the transition to 
macroalgae could be partly due to this feeding appa ratus development, in particular the 
addition of the lateral teeth L3 – L5 when the abal one are between 0.9 and 1.9 mm shell 
length (Kawamura  et al.  2001). Haliotis iris  also add lateral teeth (L3 – L5) at a similar 
size of between 1 and 1.7 mm shell length, with the  radula of postlarvae this size or 
larger considered more suitable for collecting larg e particles and gouging feeding 
substrata, compared to postlarvae smaller than 1 mm  shell length who’s less developed 
radula can only collect small diatoms and loose par ticles (Roberts  et al.  1999b). Not all 
abalone species exhibit these radula developmental changes at a similar shell length, 
with Haliotis diversicolor aquatilis  adding lateral teeth L3 and L4 at 1.5 to 2 mm shel l 
length, while L5 teeth are not added until 6 mm she ll length (Onitsuka  et al.  2004). The 
Australian abalone species H. rubra  develops L5 teeth completing the adult compliment 
of teeth on the radula, exhibits greater enzyme pro duction and increased digestive 
efficiency at between 80 and 102 d post settlement,  indicating the preparation for 
feeding on macroalgae and the beginning of the thir d nutritional transition (Johnston  et 
al.  2005). This all demonstrates the dietary transitio ns, particularly the third from a 
diatom to macroalgae-dominated diet, may occur at v arious size ranges for abalone 
species. Given these ontogenetic changes in digesti ve enzyme activity and radula Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 8 morphology occur at a shell length of less than 5 m m for many Haliotis  species, 
postlarval and juvenile abalone could ingest macroa lgae earlier than the transition 
between diatoms and adult macroalgal thalli suggest s at 5 – 10 mm shell length. 
 
Palatable, juvenile macroalgae (sporelings) have be en identified as an important 
form of food that provides the nutritional requirem ents for the transition from a diatom-
dominated to a macroalgae-dominated diet as the ont ogenetic changes of juvenile 
abalone occur (Kawamura  et al.  1998b, Takami & Kawamura 2003). Herbivores 
generally play a considerable role in the mortality  of early post settlement stages 
(sporelings) of macroalgae (Vadas  et al.  1992, Van Alstyne  et al.  1999), while the 
structural properties of sporelings differ from adu lt thalli by being thinner, smaller and 
more delicate (Van Alstyne  et al.  2001). Factors such as these suggest that juvenile  
macroalgae could be the key component in the dietar y transition of juvenile abalone 
from diatoms to macroalgae, however only limited re search has occurred into the 
dietary value of macroalgal sporelings for juvenile  abalone. Takami et al.  (2003) has 
shown that postlarval H. discus hannai  of greater than 1.8 mm shell length, actively 
ingested gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes of t he brown macroalga Laminaria 
japonica . Haliotis diversicolor  of greater than 3 mm shell length also effectively  
consumed juvenile gametophytes of the brown macroal gal species Eisenia bicyclis , 
Ecklonia cava  and Undaria pinnatifida  (Onitsuka  et al.  2010, 2011). Juvenile 
macroalgae of other brown algal species such as Colpomenia sinuosa , Ectocarpus 
siliculosus  and Endarachne binghamiae , as well as the green alga Enteromorpha  spp. 
have been shown to support moderate to rapid growth  in 3 – 4 mm Haliotis discus 
discus  (Maesako  et al.  1984). The dietary shift from diatoms to macroalga l sporelings of 
Ulva rigida  mixed with Ulvella lens , has been observed for postlarval Haliotis 
tuberculata coccinea  by the sudden increase in growth rate when the juv eniles reached 
2 mm shell length (Courtois de Vicose  et al.  2012). All of these studies demonstrate that 
abalone at a small size (2 – 3 mm shell length) can  consume and digest macroalgae, 
with the transition from a diatom-dominated to a ma croalgae-dominated diet being 
facilitated by the consumption of juvenile macroalg ae. 
 Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 9 Once the transition in dietary profiles to macroalg ae has occurred, adult abalone 
can acquire their nutritional requirements from the  adult thalli of a variety of different 
macroalgal species (Leighton & Boolootian 1963, Poo re 1972a, Shepherd 1973, 
Shepherd & Cannon 1988). The abalone can locate and  consume the macroalgae either 
by foraging locally, catching drift algae, or searc hing for food across the substratum 
(Tutschulte & Connell 1988). Australian and New Zea land abalone species tend to feed 
on drift algae with only limited localised foraging , which can be influenced by the 
macroalgal composition available (Poore 1972b, Shep herd 1973). 
 
Preference for macroalgal species differs between Haliotis  species with adult 
abalone requiring large amounts of fresh material ( Dunstan  et al.  1996, Corazani & 
Illanes 1998). The macroalgal species consumed vari es seasonally and can reflect the 
flora where the abalone resides (Leighton & Booloot ian 1963, Wells & Keesing 1989). 
Australian and New Zealand abalone species prefer r ed algae, unlike their counterparts 
elsewhere in the world that feed predominately on b rown algae (Poore 1972a, Shepherd 
& Cannon 1988, Shepherd & Steinberg 1992, Fleming 1 995b). A bias towards brown 
macroalgae such as Ecklonia  and Laminaria  has been shown in gut content analysis in a 
variety of abalone species, as these macroalgae bec ome unrecognizable relatively 
slowly during the digestion process (Foale & Day 19 92, Day & Cook 1995). Cultures of 
abalone faecal matter have indicated that less pref erred macroalgal species remain 
viable through digestion, increasing identification , while preferred species are digested 
more efficiently and do not survive (Foale & Day 19 92, Westphalen & Cheshire 1995). 
Food preference trials can be influenced by the mac roalgal diet to which the abalone 
was originally acclimatised to (Stepto & Cook 1996) , leading to a bias for more 
commonly consumed macroalgal species. 
 
Given that abalone are sedentary and feed on drift algae, the preference shown 
by Australian and New Zealand abalone species for r ed algae could be due to their high 
abundance in the natural environment, while the con sumption of brown algae tends to 
occur when more suitable algae are absent (Shepherd  & Steinberg 1992). The presence 
of high concentrations of unpalatable polyphenolic compounds in Australian brown Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 10  algae could also increase the deterrent of predatio n by abalone species (Steinberg 1988, 
1989, Steinberg & van Altena 1992). In the Australi an abalone H. rubra , the growth rate 
was shown to be related to the hierarchy of chemose nsory preference for macroalgal 
diets (Fleming 1995b), which strongly corresponds t o the digestible nitrogen content of 
the algae (Fleming 1995a). Conversely, food toughne ss has been identified as a primary 
factor when compared to chemical deterrence, in the  feeding preference of H. rubra  
(McShane  et al.  1994). 
 
1.2 ABALONE AQUACULTURE 
The popularity in economically important abalone sp ecies has resulted in over-
harvesting in many countries, while the prospect of  high prices and world demand has 
opened a major market opportunity for cultured abal one (Mgaya & Mercer 1994, Oakes 
& Ponte 1996). The decline in wild harvest yields s ince the 1970’s through the 
combination of over fishing, disease, habitat loss and illegal fishing, has coincided with 
the substantial increase in development of abalone cultivation facilities around the 
world (Gordon & Cook 2004). In fact, aquaculture pr oduction worldwide increased by 
over 350 % during the 6 years before 2008 (Cook & G ordon 2010). Over this time, 
aquaculture has made significant advances in growth  and survival of rearing abalone 
from egg to adult. However, further improvement to the current culture protocols, in 
particular juvenile nutrition, would reduce the tim e for culturing high quality abalone 
product to commercial harvest size, consequently in creasing the economic performance 
of abalone aquaculture. 
 
Feeding early life stages of abalone in aquaculture  are dependent on cultured 
algae and the control of this feed can be critical in their development (Hahn 1989b). 
Cultured algae are initially utilised to induce lar val settlement and then provide a 
suitable food source for postlarval and juvenile ab alone (Daume 2006). As the abalone 
transition from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macro algae-dominated diet at around  
5 – 10 mm shell length, the type of feed provided i n aquaculture must adjust 
accordingly. To advance this area of production, ne w juvenile diets need to be explored Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 11  that supply the appropriate type of feed at a suffi cient biomass and provide greater 
nutritional benefits over a longer time period. 
 
Abalone aquaculture within many countries accommoda tes this dietary change 
by altering the type and developmental stage of the  cultured algal fed in the nursery and 
growout systems. A wide diversity of whole, live re d, brown and green macroalgal 
species have been examined around the world for man y different juvenile abalone 
species (>10 mm shell length) in a variety of cultu re systems including tanks, baskets, 
cages and containers (e.g. Stuart & Brown 1994, Cor azani & Illanes 1998, Simpson & 
Cook 1998, Boarder & Shpigel 2001, Viera  et al.  2005, Qi  et al.  2010). For instance, 
South African abalone farms have generally preferre d artificial feeds due to 
convenience and reduced costs (Sales & Britz 2001),  but more recently they are also 
utilising whole macroalgal species in specially des igned growout systems (Naidoo  et al.  
2006, Robertson-Andersson  et al.  2011). Wild harvest kelp ( Ecklonia maxima ) has 
dominated this feed composition, however, the resou rce nears sustainable harvest limits 
and consequently, farms are researching other macro algal species (red and green) as 
alternatives (Troell  et al.  2006). 
 
1.3 AUSTRALIAN ABALONE AQUACULTURE 
In Australia, two of the commercially harvested aba lone species H. laevigata  
and H. rubra , are considered suitable for aquaculture due to th eir relatively fast growth 
rates (Hahn 1989a). Wild or conditioned captive and  farmed broodstock of these species 
are induced to spawn, and after fertilisation and t he free-swimming larval period, the 
larvae are settled in the nursery system which cons ists of coffin tanks with PVC plates 
arranged vertically in baskets (Section 2.4.1). The  crustose, green alga, U. lens  pre-
seeded onto the PVC plates has been shown to induce  higher settlement rates of abalone 
larvae compared to monospecies benthic diatom films  (Daume  et al.  2000, Krsinich  et 
al.  2000). However, by itself U. lens  only supports moderate growth rates for postlarvae  
less than 2 – 3 mm shell length, due to its high gr azing resistance (Kawamura 1996, 
Daume  et al.  2000, Huggett  et al.  2005). Therefore, easily digestible diatoms such a s 
Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  are incorporated into the system, and the combined  U. lens /diatom Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 12  diet can sustain high growth rates for postlarval a balone (Kawamura  et al.  1998b, 
Daume  et al.  2004, Daume & Ryan 2004). 
 
Australian abalone nurseries consequently use N. jeffreyi  and/or any naturally 
occurring diatoms for postlarval nutrition and as t he abalone develops, U. lens  becomes 
available for consumption (e.g. Daume & Ryan 2004, Daume 2006). By utilising both 
types of algae the diet can provide a biofilm consi sting of diatoms and their extra 
cellular products required for the first two dietar y transitions in early postlarval feeding 
and growth. Then the U. lens  can accommodate the juvenile abalone dietary trans ition 
from a biofilm-dominated to a macroalgae-dominated diet. Daume & Ryan (2002) have 
shown that H. laevigata  growth rates towards the end of a feeding trial (5 8 d) remained 
high, as the juveniles were able to access the U. lens  as a food source and therefore, 
transitioned smoothly through the third nutritional  phase. This has also been observed 
for H. tuberculata coccinea  where at 2 mm shell length, juvenile growth rates on a 
variety of benthic diatom diets all increased simul taneously, indicating a nutritional shift 
from diatoms to U. lens  and U. rigida  germlings (Courtois de Vicose  et al.  2012). The 
use of two forms of algae allows the nursery system  to maintain a supply of readily 
ingestible and digestible food, specifically tailor ed to the nutritional transitions in 
postlarval and juvenile feeding. Therefore, abalone  nurseries try and present a series of 
algal species with different grazing resistances th at closely follow the ontogenetic 
changes in digestive enzyme activity and radula mor phology of the juvenile abalone. 
This reduces starvation periods due to feed inacces sibility and can increase commercial 
growth rates and survival, consequently improving o verall production in the nursery 
system. 
 
The current commercial nursery diet utilised in Aus tralian abalone farms of  
U. lens  and N. jeffrey i provides adequate nutrition and can achieve growt h rates of  
70 µm.day -1 for juvenile H. laevigata  over extended nursery feeding trials (Daume & 
Ryan 2004, Daume  et al.  2007). However, once abalone exceed approximately 5 mm 
shell length the commercial nursery diet becomes un able to support the high abalone 
biomass per plate during the later stages of the nu rsery phase (Daume & Ryan 2004, Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 13  Daume  et al.  2007). The inadequate feed biomass caused by the h igh abalone grazing 
pressure, jeopardises growth rates and consequently  affects the future growth and 
survival of the abalone. Therefore, maintenance of adequate food has been seen as a 
major limiting factor in the intensification of aba lone hatcheries (Krsinich  et al.  2000, 
Daume 2006). 
 
Australian commercial abalone farms wean juvenile a balone from the nursery 
system onto an artificial diet in specifically desi gned tanks in the growout system. This 
can be done at anytime during the nursery stage and  depends on growth rates, food 
availability and tank space. However, the transitio n between juvenile abalone  
(5 – 15 mm shell length) feeding on natural algal d iets in the nursery system and 
weaning onto artificial feed in the growout system can be an extremely variable process 
(Daume 2003). Many studies around the world have ex amined the advantages or 
disadvantages of artificial diets with varying resu lts. Some studies have observed 
greater growth rates of juvenile abalone consuming various algal species (Daume & 
Ryan 2004, Naidoo  et al.  2006), whereas others show an increase in growth r ates 
utilising artificial diets (Viana  et al.  1993, Britz 1996a, Corazani & Illanes 1998), while  
no difference between artificial and natural diets have also been recorded (Knauer  et al.  
1996, Boarder & Shpigel 2001, Serviere-Zaragoza  et al.  2001). In Australia however, 
directly after the transition onto artificial diets , juvenile abalone growth rates are 
generally lower than those on natural algal diets, while survival can be considerably 
lower due to the stress of harvesting and weaning ( Daume & Ryan 2004, Daume  et al.  
2007). 
 
A positive alternative to address the deficiencies of weaning too early would be 
to maintain the juvenile abalone in the nursery sys tem for an extended period of time 
(up to 15 mm shell length), by either reducing the density of juvenile abalone on the 
settlement plates or utilising different algal diet s that can withstand the intense abalone 
grazing pressure (Daume 2006). Both of these manage ment strategies would maintain 
growth rates and remove the husbandry mortality, su bsequently producing high quality 
juvenile abalone through the later nursery phase. Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 14  The density of postlarval abalone in the nursery sy stem can affect the algal 
biomass attached to the plates, consequently varyin g their growth rates and survival. 
Manipulation of food supply (diatom) in a small-sca le experiment has shown that the 
effect of postlarval H. rubra  density on mortality was mostly independent of foo d, 
whereas abalone growth was strongly related to food  supply and significantly reduced at 
high initial densities (Day  et al.  2004). On a commercial scale, growth rates of juve nile 
H. laevigata  ( ≈7 mm shell length) stocked at both low (40 juvenile s per plate) and high 
(80 juveniles per plate) densities fluctuated with food density ( U. lens /N. jeffrey i), 
however overall the growth rates, weight gain and s urvival were all higher at the lower 
stocking density (Daume  et al.  2007). Reducing the stocking density on the settle ment 
plates further would have considerable ramification s on the infrastructure requirements 
(number of tanks/plates required), labour and abalo ne biomass production of the nursery 
system. Given abalone growth can be highly dependen t on food biomass over a range of 
densities, the composition of the diet consumed was  considered important for juvenile 
abalone growth. In order to critically evaluate the  ability of different algal forms and 
species to improve juvenile abalone growth and surv ival in the later nursery phase, 
stocking densities were standardised at current com mercial levels. 
 
To integrate different algae into the current nurse ry system consisting of vertical 
PVC plates, which are designed for encrusting algae  and diatom diets, a variety of 
species and techniques need to be identified and ex amined. Several species of the 
encrusting Ulvophyceae have been tested to improve nursery culture of juvenile H. iris , 
with these green algal species easily grazed by juv enile abalone of 2 – 3 mm shell 
length, indicating an appropriate food source for f acilitating the transition between 
diatoms and macroalgae, but were not sufficiently r esistant to grazing as to provide an 
alternative diet for juvenile abalone greater than 7 mm shell length (Dyck  et al.  2011). 
Given it has been demonstrated that Australian abal one species exhibit a preference for 
red algae (Section 1.1.3), Rhodophyta species could  be incorporated into the nursery 
system to provide an algal diet closer to what abal one consume in wild populations. 
Algal species that can accommodate the ontogenetic changes in postlarval abalone of  
1 – 3 mm shell length, while also providing signifi cant biomass to overcome the high 
grazing pressure of 5 – 15 mm shell length juvenile  abalone, may be a rare commodity Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 15  and very important to improving juvenile abalone nu trition in the nursery system. 
Macroalgal species with a soft, erect 3-dimensional  thalli form could have the ability to 
aid the nutritional transition from a diatom to mac roalgae-dominated diet, while also 
accommodating the intense grazing pressure of 5 – 1 5 mm shell length juvenile abalone 
in the later nursery phase. 
 
1.4 RESEARCH AIMS IN THE THESIS 
The central aim of this research was to identify, d evelop and evaluate alternative 
macroalgal diets that supply sufficient biomass to maintain commercially viable growth 
rates of the juvenile greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata ) throughout the later nursery 
phase. This was achieved by: 
1) Assessing the viability of three Rhodophyta prop agation methods (carpospore 
liberation, protoplast production and vegetative pr opagation) in developing red 
macroalgal diets for juvenile greenlip abalone. 
2) Determining the effectiveness of artificial adhe sion protocols for 
incorporating red macroalgal propagules in the curr ent Australian abalone nursery 
system. 
3) Examining the growth and survival of juvenile gr eenlip abalone (5 – 15 mm 
shell length) feeding on alternative macroalgal die ts in the later nursery phase. 
4) Comparing abalone management strategies, includi ng different harvest sizes 
and system designs. 
 
The research in this thesis consists of a series of  interrelated, fine-scale 
laboratory experiments and large-scale commercial a balone feeding trials structured to 
address these objectives. The experimental work foc used on the algal diet limitations 
currently experienced in the nursery system utilise d within Australian abalone farms. 
Subsequently all algal species and propagation tech niques were evaluated with the 
specification of being utilised on a commercial pro duction scale. Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 16  In Chapter 3 the complex triphasic life history of Rhodophyta species was 
identified, with the propagation techniques, carpos pore liberation, protoplast production 
and vegetative propagation examined in detail. Prop agule production was the primary 
assessment of the methods’ viability, however, the requirement for algal biomass and 
the ease of incorporation into a commercial operati on were also considered, with 
preliminary experimental results published in Strai n et al.  (2007). From these three 
propagation methods, suitable approaches were devel oped to create alternative 
macroalgal diets for juvenile abalone in the later nursery phase. In Chapter 4 the 
artificial adhesion protocols for incorporating red  macroalgal propagules into the current 
commercial abalone nursery system were developed. F ragment culture of several red 
macroalgal species was successfully established uti lising vegetative propagation, and 
through the artificial adhesion protocol a unique r ed macroalgal fragment diet was able 
to present substantial algal biomass to juvenile gr eenlip abalone in the nursery system 
(Strain  et al.  2005, Strain  et al.  2007). 
 
The natural recruitment processes of spore liberati on and attachment, prompted 
macroalgal sporelings to be developed as an alterna tive diet. This was the first study 
(Chapter 5) to investigate sporelings as a diet for  5 – 15 mm shell length juvenile 
abalone on a semi-commercial scale (Strain  et al.  2006). Spore liberation from red 
macroalgal species allowed a multi-species sporelin g diet to provide greater algal 
biomass and diversity for juvenile abalone. In Chap ter 5 a composite macroalgal 
sporeling diet was evaluated against an easy cultur e diet and the current commercial diet 
in the nursery system. A different abalone manageme nt system utilising an artificial diet 
was also compared to the alternative macroalgal die ts in the nursery system for rearing 
juvenile greenlip abalone during the later nursery phase. 
 
The outcomes of this research will significantly co ntribute to the management of 
juvenile abalone aquaculture by: 
1) Reducing the effect on growth and survival of ju venile abalone during the 
transition in nutritional requirements from a biofi lm-dominated to a macroalgae-
dominated diet. Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 17  2) Extending the time juvenile abalone can be maint ained in the later nursery 
phase, therefore removing the survival and growth r estrictions around the lack of algal 
biomass and early weaning. 
3) Provide commercial farms with a variety of diet and management strategies to 
produce fast growing, high quality juvenile abalone . 
 
The protocols evaluated and developed in this thesi s are transferable throughout 
the commercial abalone and macroalgal aquaculture i ndustries. The investigation into 
the macroalgal propagation methods can be incorpora ted into various aspects of the 
economically important algal cultivation industry. These methods will also aid the 
development of integrated aquaculture systems in co mmercial abalone farms through 
the culture of macroalgal species in nutrient enric hed outflow for abalone feed. On a 
broader level, this study provides insight into juv enile abalone nutritional requirements 
and expands the limited knowledge associated with t he role juvenile macroalgae plays 
in the growth and development of abalone.

the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia (32 o01’50 S 115 o45’45 E) (Figure 1). The 
area consisted of a small, shallow (0 – 1 m depth) sand bay broken up by rock walls. 
The G. flagelliformis  formed large mats and was partially submerged in t he inter-tidal 
sand/mud flat located on the southern side of the b oat ramp. 
 
Gracilaria  sp. 
Gracilaria  sp. was collected from around the eastern end of M istaken Island in 
King George Sound, Western Australia (35 o03’40 S 117 o56’50 E) (Figure 1). The Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 19  Gracilaria  was found at a depth of 4 to 12 m attached to the limestone bottom, which 
sloped down on a 45 o angle from the low tide mark. 
 
Hypnea  sp. 
Hypnea  sp. was collected from Waylen Bay in the Swan Rive r Estuary, Western 
Australia (32 o00’15 S 115 o50’25 E) (Figure 1). The Hypnea  was attached to small rocks 
and shells scattered around the eastern side of the  bay (<5 m from shore) in less than  
1 m of water. 
 
Laurencia  sp. 
Laurencia  sp. was collected from around the eastern end of M istaken Island in 
King George Sound, Western Australia (35 o03’40 S 117 o56’50 E) (Figure 1). The 
Laurencia  was attached to rocks at 8 to 12 m depth, just bef ore the sea floor levelled off 
to sand with seagrass present. 
 
Plocamium mertensii  (Greville) Harvey 
Plocamium mertensii  was collected from around the eastern end of Break sea 
Island in King George Sound, Western Australia (35 o03’45 S 118 o04’10 E) (Figure 1). 
The P. mertensii  was found among a variety of kelp species attached  to limestone rocks 
at 12 to 20 m depth. 
 
Phormidium  sp. 
Phormidium  sp. was identified as an epiphyte on the Gracilaria  collected from 
around Mistaken Island in King George Sound, Wester n Australia (35 o03’40 S 
117 o56’50 E) (Figure 1). The cyanobacterium was isolate d from Gracilaria  thallium by 
removing a few trichomes (filaments) and placing th em on a microscope slide, then 
culturing in 250 mL Petri dishes with 200 mL of f/2  medium (Section 2.2, DFSW). Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 20  Ulva  spp. 
The Ulva  spp. thalli collected consisted predominately of Ulva lactuca , however 
a small percentage of Ulva fasciata  was also present in some samples. Ulva  was 
collected from next to the East Street Jetty (32 o02’28 S 115 o45’25 E) and along the 
South Mole (32 o03’19 S 115 o43’59 E) in the Swan River Estuary, Western Austral ia 
(Figure 1). East Street Jetty has large limestone b oulder/rock walls running adjacent to 
the jetty, which angle down into the water where at  a depth of 1 to 5 m the substratum 
becomes sand or mud. South Mole is a groyne (rock w all) at the entrance of the Swan 
River Estuary consisting of large limestone and gra nite boulders. The Ulva  thalli 
removed from both locations were attached to the ro ck substrata just below (<1 m) the 
mean seawater level. 
 
Ulvella lens  P.L. Crouan & H.M. Crouan 
Ulvella lens  was acquired from the stock culture at the commerc ial abalone 
farm, Great Southern Marine Hatcheries in Albany, W estern Australia. PVC plates with 
large mature patches of U. lens  attached were wiped down to remove contaminating 
algal species and placed in a 400 L nursery tank wi th 1 µm filtered flow through 
seawater (2 L.min -1) and kept in complete darkness. 
 
Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  
The diatom Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  (CS-514) was obtained from the culture 
collection at CSIRO Marine Research, Microalgae Res earch Branch in Hobart, 
Tasmania. It was maintained as a stock culture in 5 0 mL cell culture flasks with 25 mL 
of f/2 medium (Section 2.2, DFSW). This particular strain of Navicula jeffreyi  was 
isolated from Port Fairy, Victoria by Dr Sabine Dau me in 1999.

 22  2.1.1 Macroalgal Collection 
The macroalgal material collected from the environm ent was carefully removed 
by hand at the holdfast to maintain the maximum amo unt of thalli. After collection, the 
algal thalli were placed in between moist paper tow el within insulated containers, which 
had cool packs to maintain a constant and even temp erature gradient (Chen & Shih 
2000). The macroalgal species were then transported  to the various locations depending 
on the experimentation (Murdoch University, Fremant le TAFE, Great Southern Marine 
Hatcheries and the Western Australian Fisheries Mar ine Research Laboratories). 
 
2.2 ALGAL CULTURING 
2.2.1 Seawater Filtration 
The seawater utilised came from a variety of source s and depending on the 
location of the experiments, facilities available a nd volume of seawater required, 
different sterilisation methods were used to remove  any biological contaminates. The 
salinity of the seawater was measured using a Hand Refractometer (Atago N1, Japan) to 
check that a consistent level of 35 – 36 PSU was ma intained. 
 
Double Filtered Seawater (DFSW) 
The seawater was treated with activated charcoal (1  g.L -1) for 2 h and then left 
overnight. The charcoal treated seawater was then f iltered twice, once through two 
Whatman No. 1 filter papers and then again through a Whatman nitrocellulose 
membrane 0.45 µm filter (Advantec, MFS) (Buttery 2000). The double  filtered seawater 
(DFSW) was then left to cure at 18 ± 2 oC, in polycarbonate containers in the dark and 
when required, autoclaved at 121 oC for 20 min before use. 
 
Charcoal Column Filtered Seawater (CCFSW) 
A Charcoal Column Filter (Eheim, Germany) packed wi th activated charcoal 
beads and glass cotton wool was connected directly to the seawater storage tank’s Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 23  outlet. The required volume of seawater was filtere d through the Charcoal Column 
Filter into polycarbonate containers. 
 
Inline Column Filtration (ICF) 
The seawater was filtered directly through an inlin e column filtration system 
(Puretec Water Filters) utilising either a 1 or 5 µm poly-micro filter cartridge. For flow 
through experiments the cartridge filters were clea ned twice a week by high-pressure 
hose and then exposed to the Chlorination process w eekly. This enabled the seawater to 
be effectively filtered and the desired flow rate m aintained throughout the various 
experiments. 
 
Chlorination 
The amount of seawater required for culturing was f iltered through a 1 µm inline 
column filtration system and measured into the appr opriate experimental vessel (flask, 
polycarbonate containers, tank, etc). Chlorine at 1 0 ppm was added to the seawater and 
left overnight in darkness for sterilisation. Liqui d pool chlorine has 125 g.L -1 available 
chlorine as sodium hypochlorine (12.5 % active ingr edient), which equates to an 
application rate in this process of 0.08 mL per lit re of seawater. To neutralise the active 
chlorine the dechlorination process utilises 0.025 mL.L -1 of 2 M sodium thiosulphate 
under heavy aeration for several hours. 
 
2.2.2 Culture Media 
All chemicals and solvents used throughout this res earch were analytical grade 
(A.R.). The deionised water required for media stoc k solutions and other experimental 
procedures was attained from the laboratory in-hous e unit, Permutit Water Generation 
System. Different culture media were utilised durin g experimentation depending on the 
methodology, volume required and algal species bein g cultured. f/2 and modified 
Provasoli enriched seawater medium were used for st ock cultures and fine-scale 
laboratory procedures, while Micro Algae Food with silicate and Abasol both water-Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 24  soluble fertilisers, were incorporated into large-s cale algal culture for the juvenile 
greenlip abalone feeding trials. 
 
f/2 Medium 
f/2 culture medium (Guillard & Ryther 1962) was use d as a growth medium for 
microalgal cultures and macroalgal sporeling cultur es to provide nutrient supplemented 
seawater for faster growth (Steffensen 1976, Stratm ann  et al.  1996, Gómez-Pinchetti  et 
al.  1998). The f/2 culture medium was prepared accordi ng to Table 1 and followed the 
procedure of Guillard & Ryther (1962) as modified b y Buttery (2000).

2.2.3 Equipment Sterilisation 
All equipment utilised for the small-scale algal cu lture and laboratory 
experiments was first washed 3 times with the biode gradable, phosphate free, non 
flammable Decon 90 (2 – 5 % solution). The equipmen t was then rinsed 12 times in 
deionised water to remove the biological detergent and air-dried. Sterilisation was 
achieved via a commercial autoclave set at 121 oC for 20 min. Once sterilised the 
equipment was dried in an oven (70 oC) overnight and then placed in a laminar flow unit  
under UV light until required. The high volume equi pment (tanks, aquaria, etc) required 
for the large-scale experiments and algal culturing  were scrubbed clean, then the 
Chlorination process (Section 2.2.1) administered t o sterilise the equipment and 
seawater simultaneously. 
 Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 28  2.2.4 Culture Isolation and Maintenance 
Stock cultures of all the algal species were create d to maintain axenic, single 
species culture as reserve during experimentation. For the macroalgal species of 
Gracilaria chilensis , Gracilaria flagelliformis , Gracilaria  sp., Hypnea  sp., Laurencia  
sp., Plocamium mertensii  and Ulva  spp., the thalli was first cleaned of epiphytes us ing 
sterile seawater, deionised water and sterile cotto n wool. The macroalgae was then 
surface sterilised using a 1 % (v/v) Betadine solut ion (Lawlor  et al.  1991) and rinsed 
with sterile seawater, before being placed in 250 m L Erlenmeyer flasks with 150 mL of 
modified Provasoli enriched seawater medium (Sectio n 2.2, DFSW). The epiphytic 
cyanobacterium, Phormidium  sp. and the diatom Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  were isolated and 
cultured as described in Section 2.1. All algal sto ck cultures were in replicates of three 
and maintained at 18 ± 2 oC on a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 
until required. 
 
The macroalgal species essential for large-scale ex periments were not grown in 
sufficient biomass from the stock cultures, hence f resh material was collected as 
required. The harvested macroalgae were maintained in conical tanks (200 L) with 1 µm 
flow through seawater (ICF) at 2 L.min -1 and received strong aeration, outdoors under 
natural irradiance. 
 
2.3 BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS 
Algal samples were taken by scraping a known area o f the PVC plate’s surface 
and collecting the algal biomass that was removed. Samples were then stored at -20 oC 
until needed. 
 
2.3.1 Ash Weight by Deduction 
Samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C (2.5 cm)  glass microfibre filters 
that had been washed, pre-combusted (450 oC) and pre-weighed. The filtrate was then 
washed with 10 mL ammonium formate solution (0.65 M ) to remove excess salts, dried Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 29  in an oven for 12 h (80 oC) and placed in a vacuum desiccator over silica ge l for 24 h. 
The resulting dried filtrate was weighed to 4 decim al places on an analytical balance 
and the initial filter weight subtracted to determi ne the sample’s dry weight. The ash 
weight was calculated by deducting the biochemical components, lipid, protein and 
carbohydrate from the sample’s dry weight. All bioc hemical components were 
presented on a dry matter basis and expressed as g/ 100 g dry weight of the filtered 
sample. 
 
2.3.2 Lipid Determination 
The lipid content of algal samples were determined by the method of Bligh & 
Dyer (1959), incorporating modifications by Kates &  Volcani (1966) and adaptations by 
Mercz (1994). Samples were filtered through Whatman  GF/C (2.5 cm) glass microfibre 
filters, rinsed with 10 mL ammonium formate (0.65 M ) and stored at -20 oC for 
approximately 2 months. 
 
Once thawed, the filtered samples were homogenised in a glass mortar and 
pestle with 5 mL methanol:chloroform:deionised wate r solution (2:1:0.8 v/v/v). The 
extract was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and t he supernatant transferred to a 
second, 10 mL graduated glass centrifuge tube. The volume was made up to 5.7 mL 
with fresh methanol:chloroform:deionised water, the n 1.5 mL chloroform and 1.5 mL 
deionised water were added while mixing well. The t ubes were re-centrifuged  
(3000 rpm for 5 min), after which phase separation was complete and the lower green 
chloroform layer containing the lipids was carefull y transferred into dry, pre-weighted  
4 mL glass vials. A few drops of toluene were added  and the extract dried under ultra 
pure nitrogen. The vials containing lipid were plac ed in a vacuum desiccator over KOH 
pellets for 24 h and then weighed to 4 decimal plac es. The weight of lipid in the samples 
was determined by subtracting the pre-weight of the  vials (no lipid present) from the 
final weight of the vials, containing lipid. 
 
 Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 30  2.3.3 Protein Determination 
The protein content of the algal samples was determ ined utilising a modification 
of the Lowry et al.  (1951) method by Dorsey et al.  (1978) and Mercz (1994). Samples 
were prepared as in the Lipid Determination procedu re above. 
 
The filtered samples were homogenised with 5 mL Biu ret reagent in a glass 
mortar and pestle, then transferred into 10 mL grad uated glass centrifuge tubes and  
0.14 mL deionised water added. Protein standards (B ovine Serum Albumin) of 0, 10, 
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 µg were made up to 0.14 mL with deionised water and 5 mL 
Biuret reagent added. All tubes were incubated at 1 00 oC for 60 min and immediately 
after 0.5 mL Folin Phenol reagent was added while m ixing on a Vortex stirrer. The 
tubes were cooled for 15 min at 10 – 15 oC and 15 min at room temperature then 
centrifuged (3000 rpm for 5 min). The absorbance of  the supernatant was read at  
660 nm and the protein content determined from the standard curve. 
 
2.3.4 Carbohydrate Determination 
The carbohydrate content of the algal samples was d etermined using the method 
of Kochert (1978) with modifications by Ben-Amotz et al.  (1985) and Mercz (1994). 
Samples were prepared as in the Lipid Determination  procedure above. 
 
Five millilitre of H 2SO 4 (1 M) was used to homogenise the filtered samples in a 
glass mortar and pestle before being transferred in to 10 mL graduated glass centrifuge 
tubes and incubated at 100 oC for 60 min. After cooling to room temperature and  
centrifuging (3000 rpm for 5 min), a known volume o f supernatant (<50 µg total 
carbohydrate, which was between 0.1 to 0.5 mL, depe nding on initial algal 
concentration) was taken and made up to 2 mL with d eionised water in 10 mL 
graduated glass centrifuge tubes. Carbohydrate stan dards (Glucose) of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 
50 µg were made up to 2 mL with deionised water. One mi llilitre of 5 % (w/v) phenol 
solution was added and mixed well on a Vortex stirr er. Five millilitre of concentrated Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 31  H2SO 4 (98 %, 18 M) was added rapidly and then the tubes left for 30 min to cool. 
Absorbance was measured at 485 nm and the carbohydr ate content determined from the 
standard curve. 
 
2.4 ABALONE FEEDING TRIAL 
2.4.1 System Design 
The set up, configuration and maintenance of the nu rsery and weaner systems 
used for the juvenile greenlip abalone feeding tria ls, endeavoured to replicate what’s 
currently used at Australian commercial abalone nur series. 
 
Nursery System 
The nursery system consisted of 400 L fibreglass co ffin tanks connected in 
banks (Figure 2a). Each tank contained three metal baskets of 20 vertically arranged 
PVC settlement plates (60 x 30 cm). Inline column f iltration (Section 2.2.1) supplied  
1 µm filtered seawater at 10 L.min -1 via a spray bar above the water surface and a 
standpipe (50 mm PVC pipe) was used as a drain to m aintain water level. The filtered 
seawater was aerated by three weighted airlines (se epage hose) spaced evenly along the 
bottom of the tank. All tanks were shaded with 70 %  shade cloth when stocked with 
abalone. For each of the experimental algal diets a nd the current commercial nursery 
diet of U. lens  and N.  jeffreyi  tested in the feeding trial, three replicate and r andomly 
positioned, 400 L nursery tanks were stocked with a balone. 
 
Weaner System 
The weaner tank was a shallow (160 L) round tank wi th cascading flat levels to 
a centre standpipe or drain (Figure 2b). The inner level of the tank at the drain was  
20 cm deep while the depth of the outer level was o nly 2 cm. Each tank had artificial 
grass attached to the side to prevent abalone from crawling out. Inline column filtration 
(Section 2.2.1) supplied 1 µm filtered seawater at 5 L.min -1 via a spray bar with holes in 
opposite directions on either side of the drain, to  create greater water movement Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 32  (whirlpool effect), as there was no aeration. All t anks were covered with 70 % shade 
cloth and each diet (treatment) was replicated in t hree, randomly assigned tanks.

nursery system utilising vertical PVC plates with n atural algal diets attached (a) and the 
weaner system incorporating artificial diets (b). 
 
 Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 33  2.4.2 System Maintenance 
Nursery System 
The water and material at the bottom of all nursery  tanks were siphoned through 
a 50 µm mesh weekly, to remove any abalone mortalities, a balone faeces and dead algal 
matter. This enabled the tanks to remain clean and reduce the growth of any algal 
contamination, while also making only the algal mat erial attached to the PVC plates be 
consumed by the abalone. All nursery tanks had the PVC plate’s rotated 180 o about the 
horizontal and Abasol added, at regular intervals t o maintain an even coverage of the 
algal diet. The commercial nursery diet ( U. lens  and N. jeffreyi ) tanks were inoculated 
with N. jeffreyi  and MAF added, at regular intervals throughout the  trial to maintain the 
diatoms’ density. 
 
Weaner System 
The weaner system utilised commercially produced ar tificial feeds (50 % coarse 
crumb and 50 % 3 mm noodle, Adam and Amos, Mt. Bark er, South Australia) at a rate 
of 2 % body weight per day (dry food, live abalone) . The feed was delivered by hand, 
left overnight and the tank cleaned with increased water flow to reduce bacteria build 
up. This procedure was repeated every second day th roughout the trial. 
 
2.4.3 Juvenile Greenlip Abalone 
Juvenile greenlip abalone ( H. laevigata ) of the appropriate size, were taken off 
an U. lens  and naturally occurring diatoms diet at a commerci al abalone farm. They 
were then transported on PVC plates seeded with U. lens , between wet sponge sheets in 
insulated containers. The PVC plates with juveniles  attached were placed either across 
the top of the baskets in nursery tanks or on the b ottom of weaner tanks and left for a 
week to allow the juveniles to migrate off. Juvenil e abalone were stocked at 
commercially appropriate densities of approximately  40 juveniles per 60 x 30 cm plate 
(110 abalone.m -2) in each of the nursery tanks and between 1100 – 1 900 juvenile 
abalone.m -2 in the weaner tanks, depending on the number of ju veniles obtained and the 
size of the tank available. Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 34  2.4.4 Commercial Nursery Diet 
Ulvella lens 
The nursery tanks and all contents (plates, baskets  and airlines) were scrubbed 
clean, filled with 1 µm filtered seawater (ICF) and sterilised using the Chlorination 
process (Section 2.2.1). The U. lens  spore collection methods were adapted from 
Takahashi & Koganezawa (1988), with twenty seed pla tes (60 x 30 cm PVC) that had 
been dark adapted for 2 weeks placed in each nurser y tank at regular intervals between 
clean 60 x 30 cm PVC plates and exposed to sunlight . The tanks received no water flow 
(static) and Abasol was added to the sterilised sea water to provide nutrients, while the 
aeration was low to allow the released U. lens  spores to attach onto the new clean plates. 
Once sporulation had occurred (5 – 7 d) the U. lens  seed plates were removed and the 
filtered seawater and Abasol exchanged weekly. 
 
Navicula  cf. jeffreyi  
The diatom, N.  jeffreyi  was incorporated as part of the control diet and w hen 
required for nursery tank inoculation was scaled up  according to Table 5. The various 
sized, horizontally laid algal bags were clear plas tic bags of approximately 5 cm depth 
with a tap cut into one corner. Stock and bag cultu res were all maintained in a 
controlled temperature room at 18 ± 2 oC on a 12 h: 12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1. The Mexican hat was a shallow ( ≈10 cm deep), round tank placed 
outside, receiving natural irradiance. The seawater  sterilisation process and medium 
source differed depending on the volume required, w ith 1 µm filtered (ICF), autoclaved 
f/2 medium used for the stock culture, small and me dium bags, and 1 µm filtered (ICF), 
Chlorination treated with MAF used in the large bag , Mexican hat and nursery tank 
cultures (Section 2.2). 
 
To harvest the bag and Mexican hat cultures the dia tom cells were detached 
from the bottom by gentle agitation and drained int o the next size culture vessel. The  
N. jeffreyi  density in the Mexican hat was determined ( ≈ x10 5 – 10 6 diatom.mL -1) and 
the inoculums (60 L initially then 20 L thereafter)  were then poured into the nursery Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 35  tank along with the addition of MAF, at regular int ervals. The nursery tank had no water 
flow, with the static seawater receiving light aera tion for 24 h to allow the N. jeffreyi  to 
attach onto the PVC plates. All culture stages were  harvested during the exponential 
phase, 5 to 7 d after inoculation and conducted in replicates of three in order to increase 
the volume and decrease contamination while maintai ning healthy N. jeffreyi  cultures.

2.4.5 Measurements 
Abalone shell length as measured across the longest  axis of the shell (mm) and 
whole weight (g) were recorded at the beginning of the nursery feeding trial and then 
periodically throughout the trial, by collecting a sub sample of juveniles from every 
nursery and weaner tank. To compare the growth perf ormance of abalone between the 
experimental diets and the current commercial diets  (both nursery and weaner systems) 
in the feeding trial; growth rate, specific growth rate and weight gain were determined. 
Abalone shell length (mm) was utilised for growth r ate ( µm.day -1) and specific growth 
rate (% length.day -1), which were calculated by Equation 1 and Equation  2 respectively; 
while whole, live abalone weight (g) was used in Eq uation 3 for computing weight gain 
(µg.day -1). After the juvenile abalone had been measured, th e contents of each tank 
were siphoned and the mortalities (dead abalone) co unted. The number of dead abalone 
was subtracted from the stocking density to give a survival estimate or progressive 
abalone density at each measurement time period.

Counting the number of algae per cm 2 or estimating the percentage cover of 
algae on the settlement plates at regular time inte rvals determined the algal density of 
the experimental diets. Every fifth plate was sampl ed with the algal cover measured 
diagonally across the plate in 5 randomly selected fields of view through a dissecting 
microscope (0.785 cm 2). The density of U. lens  was determined by estimating 
percentage cover within a field of view, using the same sampling procedure as the 
experimental diet’s algae. The density of N. jeffreyi  was measured on two removable, 
sample plates attached at the top and bottom of eve ry sixth settlement plate. The number 
of diatoms present on the sample plates was counted  along a microscope graticule  
(x40 magnification) in 20 randomly chosen fields of  view and the number of  
diatom.cm -2 calculated. 
 
For each of the algal species utilised as a diet wi thin the nursery system, its 
change in abundance or density over time (d) was co nverted into a consumption rate. 
This “consumption rate” was actually a balance betw een the algal species consumption Chapter 2 – General Material and Methods 
 37  by abalone and its reproduction/settlement. Given o nly a few of the algal species 
showed evidence of reproduction at various times du ring the feeding trials and the 
consumption by juvenile abalone was the major cause  of the algal species change in 
density, consumption rate was used to illustrate th e change in algal biomass during the 
abalone feeding trial. Therefore, if “negative” con sumption rates occurred, it indicated 
that the algal species were reproducing at a faster  rate than the juvenile abalone could 
consume them. The consumption rates for algae measu red as a density (algae.cm -2) were 
calculated by Equation 4 and presented as algae.aba lone -1.day -1, while the consumption 
rates for the algae recorded as percentage cover of  the settlement plate were determined 
by Equation 5 and had units of % cover.abalone -1.day -1.

PROPAGATION OF RHODOPHYTA SPECIES FOR NUTRITION 
OF JUVENILE GREENLIP ABALONE 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
To incorporate different macroalgae, particularly s pecies of Rhodophyta, in a 
diet for juvenile greenlip abalone on the PVC settl ement plates utilised within the 
nursery system, appropriate techniques need to be i dentified and developed. Three cell 
culture techniques; (1) spore liberation, (2) proto plast production and (3) vegetative 
propagation are examined here, as they facilitate p ropagation and development of 
macroalgal genotypes (Reddy  et al.  2008b) suitable for juvenile abalone nutrition. 
 
3.1.1 Carpospores of Red Macroalgae 
Algae of the Phylum Rhodophyta (red algae), Class F lorideophycidae have a 
triphasic life history with an alternation of haplo id and diploid phases (Figure 3), 
including a stage unique to this Phylum; the carpos porophyte, a diploid phase 
(cystocarp) parasitic on the gametophyte (Hommersan d & Fredericq 1990, Kain & 
Destombe 1995). Therefore, this triphasic life hist ory consists of the gametophyte 
(haploid), carposporophyte (diploid) and tetrasporo phyte (diploid) stages (Guimarães  et 
al.  1999, Engel  et al.  2001). Red macroalgal species produce two types of  non-motile 
spores; the tetraspores (meiospores) and the carpos pores (zygospores), that once 
released will settle out of the water column, attac h to substratum and grow into small 
plantlets (Destombe  et al.  1989, Destombe  et al.  1992) (Figure 3). 
 
Different phenotype stages, spore mortality and rec ruitment all play vital roles in 
the population structure of red macroalgal communit ies (Mantri  et al.  2010). Plants of 
each of the 3 life history stages are not usually f ound in equal abundance in natural red 
algal communities and dominance of one phase over t he others can often occur (Kong & 
Ang 2004). This causes variation in the seasonality  of material, as sexual phenotypes, Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 39  sexual maturity and the vegetative phase change ove r a range of spatial and temporal 
scales (Kain 1982, Destombe  et al.  1989, Guillemin  et al.  2008). Therefore, the 
production of spores can be extremely variable and depends on numerous factors 
including species, season, temperature, irradiance,  photoperiod, desiccation and osmotic 
pressure (Friedlander & Dawes 1984, Guzmán-Uriósteg ui & Robledo 1999, Orduña-
Rojas & Robledo 1999, Garza-Sánchez  et al.  2000). The number of carpospores 
released from 1 g of fertile female gametophyte can  be up to 8 x 10 4 carpospores.g -1 
(Gracilaria arcuata , Gracilaria asiatica , Gracilaria corticata  and Gracilaria pacifica ), 
while tetraspore releases of up to 1 x10 5 tetraspores.g -1 ( G. arcuata , G. corticata ,  
G. pacifica ) have been achieved (Umamaheswara Rao 1976, Kaliap erumal  et al.  1986, 
Xiuliang & Meizhen 1989, Garza-Sánchez  et al.  2000). These are maximum reported 
yields and variability in spore release and the rel ationship between spore and sporeling 
density (Azanza & Ask 2003), will directly affect t he plantlet density achieved and the 
quantity of fertile red macroalgal biomass required .

species reproductive propagation through spore libe ration (Sourced from Kain & 
Destombe (1995) as reproduced from Kain (1991)). 
 Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 40  Macroalgal spore recruitment also influences the de nsity of tetraspores and 
carpospores germinating into plantlets and can rang e from 0 to 85 % (Oza  et al.  1994, 
Buschmann  et al.  1999, Garza-Sánchez  et al.  2000). The variations in germination rates 
are dictated by two factors: the dispersal of spore s and the attachment to the substratum. 
The dispersal rates of the non-motile red macroalga l spores are primarily dependent on 
spore size and settlement rates, which directly aff ect spore viability (Coon  et al.  1972, 
Clayton 1992, Destombe  et al.  1992). Locating suitable substrata through settlem ent 
cues and subsequent attachment also plays an import ant role in the successful 
germination of red macroalgal spores (Fletcher & Ca llow 1992, Santelices & Aedo 
1999). Palmaria palmata  sporelings with a settlement survival of 35 %, pro duced an 
average density of approximately 200 sporelings.cm -2 after 2 months of culturing on 
plates for juvenile abalone consumption (Le Gall  et al.  2004). Spore densities in this 
order of magnitude (200 spores.cm -2) have been identified for multiple algal species a s 
producing adequate sporeling cover (density) on sub strata (Alveal  et al.  1997, Le Gall  et 
al.  2004). The green algae, Ulva  spp. can readily produce sporeling densities of  
160 – 180 sporeling.cm -2 on artificial substrata from a single induced, spo re release 
event (Section 5.1.3). 
 
Spore release is the fundamental means of propagati on for marine benthic 
macroalgae. The successful incorporation of this pr opagation method into macroalgal 
cultivation protocols can be determined by two crit ical factors, spore liberation potential 
and early sporeling development (Mantri  et al.  2009). Once these two factors have been 
examined, the amount and source of the reproductive  phenotype also plays a role in the 
ability of commercial abalone farms’ to incorporate  spore-based macroalgal propagation 
into culture protocols designed for juvenile abalon e diet development. 
 
The red macroalgal species, Gracilaria chilensis , Hypnea  sp. and Plocamium 
mertensii  were exposed to three treatments – temperature, da rk and osmotic pressure – 
to induce the release of carpospores and determine the alga’s capacity for naturally 
seeding the vertical PVC plates in the abalone nurs ery system. 
 Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 41  3.1.2 Red Macroalgal Protoplast Production 
Protoplasts have been isolated and cultured for dec ades from a diverse range of 
higher plants including herbaceous and tree species , for use in physiological, cytological 
and molecular studies. Their use has substantially expanded in genetic research 
including hybridisation, gene manipulation and muta tion isolation (Carlson 1973, Galun 
1981, Ahuia 1982). These applications for protoplas t isolation of terrestrial plants have 
also been applied to marine algae for use in commer cial seaweed cultivation (Reddy  et 
al.  2008a). 
 
Initially the majority of protoplast research was o n morphologically simple 
macroalgae, such as Ulva , Enteromorpha  and Porphyra  (Polne-Fuller & Gibor 1984, 
Chen 1986, Polne-Fuller & Gibor 1986, Reddy  et al.  1989, Björk  et al.  1992). By the 
use of cell wall lytic enzymes, protoplast isolatio n protocols have improved allowing 
the more complex Rhodophyta (red) and Phaeophyta (b rown) species to readily produce 
viable protoplasts (Reddy  et al.  2008a). This improvement in reliability of protopl ast 
procedures has instigated a focus shift to the comm ercially important culture of the 
agarophyte algae, in particular the Gracilaria  species (see Table 4 in Gupta  et al.  2011). 
However, protoplasts have also been successfully is olated from numerous other red 
macroalgae genera, for example Bangia , Grateloupia  and Palmaria  (Liu  et al.  1992, 
Araki  et al.  1994, Chen & Chiang 1994, Lafontaine  et al.  2011). In fact, over 40 species 
of Rhodophyta have been successfully used for proto plast isolation, while more than  
20 species of both Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta have also been studied (see Table 2 in 
Reddy  et al.  2008a). 
 
A protoplast can be generally defined as a plant ce ll devoid of its cell wall 
(Galun 1981) and their production allows single cel ls to be isolated from whole sections 
of algal thallus. The connective tissue between cel ls must be broken down, allowing the 
cells to separate and subsequently the cell wall di gested, creating a protoplast. Enzyme 
extracts from the gut of sea snails, including abal one have been used as the cell wall 
digestants (Liu  et al.  1984, Cheney  et al.  1986, Inoue  et al.  2008), while numerous 
enzymes isolated from Phycophages and micro-organis ms have also been tested (see Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 42  Table 1 in Reddy  et al.  2008a). Over time this method has evolved and now technical 
procedures utilising agarase and commercial enzymes  (Cellulase Onozuka RS and 
Macerozyme R-10) have been developed for the isolat ion of protoplasts from 
Gracilaria  species (Araki  et al.  1998, Gupta  et al.  2011). 
 
Once protoplasts have been produced from the macroa lgal thallus, cell wall 
regeneration and subsequently cell differentiation can occur. Protoplasts can be 
maintained in culture directly after isolation, bef ore cell wall regeneration has begun 
(Björk  et al.  1990, Mollet  et al.  1995). In some cases Gracilaria  protoplasts in culture 
develop into callus formations (Cheney  et al.  1986). This callus can also form whole 
plantlets, but only a small percentage of protoplas ts isolated from various species have 
been shown to do this (Yan & Wang 1993, Yeong  et al.  2008). As callus formation 
occurs and filaments develop into plantlets, the is olated macroalgae can directly attach 
to substrata. 
 
Protoplast production requires very small amounts o f macroalgal material,  
for example, 1 g fresh weight of Gracilaria verrucosa  can produce up to  
1.03 x 10 8 protoplasts.g -1 (Araki  et al.  1998). This small amount of red macroalgal 
material does not need to come from any specific ph enotype and subsequently the 
variation in the seasonality of material in terms o f sexual phenotypes, sexual maturity 
and vegetative phase becomes irrelevant. The isolat ion of a large number of protoplasts 
from suitable red macroalgae eliminates the issues associated with the triphasic life 
history (carpospore production) and has the potenti al to produce large quantities of 
single-celled biomass, which can potentially be use d as seed material to grow plantlets 
for use in aquaculture. This has been achieved unde r laboratory conditions using green 
macroalgae, by seeding threads with isolated protop lasts, and after 3 – 4 weeks tiny 
plantlets were present (Reddy  et al.  2006). 
 
The ability of protoplasts to be used as a seed mat erial for macroalgal culture 
indicated it could be a possible propagation method  to develop red macroalgal diets for Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 43  juvenile abalone in the nursery system. Red macroal gal species Gracilaria 
flagelliformis , Gracilaria  sp., Hypnea  sp. and Laurencia  sp. were examined as to 
whether this propagation method can produce commerc ial quantities of protoplasts and 
subsequently seed the vertical PVC plates with whol e plantlets of sufficient biomass, to 
accommodate the grazing pressure of juvenile greenl ip abalone. 
 
3.1.3 Vegetative Propagation of Red Macroalgae 
The application of algal thalli fragments to produc e plantlets by vegetative 
growth has been successfully used in macroalgal pro pagation for the mass culturing of 
seaweeds. Over 200 macroalgal species are in commer cial production around the world 
(Zemke-White & Ohno 1999) and many of these are cul tured by vegetative propagation 
in both sea/pond culture and onshore facilities (Mc Lachlan 1991, Oliveira  et al.  2000). 
This method of propagation has been particularly pr ofitable in the agarophyte industry, 
in the commercial cultivation of red algae genera s uch as Gelidium , Gracilaria  and 
Gigartina  (Ajisaka & Chiang 1993, Buschmann  et al.  1995, Buschmann  et al.  2001). 
Commercial cultivation occurs through a variety of methods with a common practice 
being to splice/braid the algal thalli on ropes, an d either suspending them or bottom 
plant them, in the sea or in shallow ponds or tank systems (Santelices & Doty 1989, 
Oliveira  et al.  2000). Commercial growth rates of Gracilaria  species using this 
suspended rope cultivation system can average 3.5 % .day -1 (Dawes 1995), while 
vegetative fragments (10 cm long) stocked at low de nsity (20 cm intervals) on ropes 
suspended in floating cages have reported growth ra tes up to 10.5 %.day -1 (Hurtado-
Ponce 1990). Maximum growth rates ranging from 0.86  to 4.45 %.day -1 have also been 
attained using 5 – 10 cm fragments for a variety of  Gracilaria  species (Chaoyuan  et al.  
1993, Chirapart & Ohno 1993). 
 
The use of vegetative fragments in the agarophyte i ndustry by artificially 
attaching the macroalgae to substrata rather than b y spore production and subsequent 
germination; has removed the issues associated with  the complex triphasic life history 
of the Rhodophyta, including seasonal availability of the sexual phenotypes and sexual 
maturity. There then becomes no need to rely on spo re liberation for algal production, as Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 44  vegetative propagation utilises the regenerative ca pacity of the algae with any thallus 
section of any phenotype suitable (Dixon 1973, Sant elices & Varela 1995). Young 
branches are generally selected for their fast grow th meristem, which can be found in 
the apex of the thallus; however, this does not alw ays relate to faster growth of 
fragments (Santelices & Varela 1995). Gracilaria chilensis  has shown bud 
differentiation and callus formation when cut into 5 mm apical and medial fragments, 
then cultured for a month (Collantes  et al.  2004). Smaller fragments (2 mm) of 
Eucheuma denticulatum  produced new cells from the cut surface after 2 – 3 d, while 
growth rates ranged from 5.8 – 7.2 %.day -1 when the fragments were out-planted at  
2 – 5 cm (Hurtado & Cheney 2003). Fragments of Kappaphycus alvarezii  (2 mm) also 
took 2 – 3 d for new cells to be present at the cut  surfaces with callus formation after  
25 – 30 d (Hurtado & Biter 2007), while the earlies t shoot primordia of K. alvarezii  
fragments (2 mm) have been produced in under 3 week s (Yunque  et al.  2011). 
 
During culture of small macroalgal fragments, wound  healing of the cut surfaces 
can have significant implications for survival and growth. The wound healing process 
occurs by new cortex sealing the excised edge and c an be completed within 3 weeks for 
Eucheuma alvarezii  (Azanza-Corrales & Dawes 1989). Fragments of Gigartina 
skottsbergii  can achieve complete wound healing by day 20 in cu lture conditions of  
5 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 at 10 and 15 oC (Buschmann  et al.  1999, Correa  et al.  1999), 
while the excised edges of Gelidium  sp. fragments (1 – 2 mm) were covered by crust 
cells and growth had appeared in the first 2 weeks (Titlyanov & Titlyanova 2006). To 
enable red macroalgal fragments to be utilised in j uvenile abalone diets, it was 
important for wound healing to occur and that appro priate survival rates are achieved, 
so that the fragments can grow and increase the alg al biomass available for abalone 
consumption. 
 
Vegetative propagation of thallus fragments can be a simple means of 
determining culture conditions for macroalgae that are not suited to the more advanced 
propagation methods of protoplast and tissue cultur e (Reddy  et al.  2008b). Given the 
ease of macroalgal cultivation by fragmentation com pared to other propagation Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 45  methods, it’s a common commercial propagation metho d that has the potential to 
produce significant macroalgal biomass as an altern ative diet for juvenile abalone. 
Therefore, the vegetative growth and survival of fr agments from the red macroalgal 
species Gracilaria  sp., Hypnea  sp. and Laurencia  sp. were assessed for their suitability 
for use in a commercial abalone nursery diet. 
 
3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
3.2.1 Carpospores of Red Macroalgae 
A preliminary, small-scale experiment was carried o ut using Plocamium 
mertensii  harvested from the Breaksea Island collection site  (Section 2.1), with a 
combined temperature and dark treatment to induce t he release of spores. Fertile thalli 
of P. mertensii  were selected and an induction treatment of 4 – 6 oC in darkness for 24 h 
applied by refrigerating the thalli in plastic tray s covered with moist newspaper. Ten 
gram of blotted algal thalli was then placed in a c ontainer with 200 mL of 1 µm filtered 
seawater (ICF) at 16 ± 2 oC, exposed to a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 100 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1 with spore release monitored over a 4 h period. 
 
For the larger carpospore production experiment, fe male gametophytes with 
mature cystocarps (carposporophyte stage) of Gracilaria chilensis , Hypnea  sp. and  
P. mertensii  were selected from either the algal material cultu red on site or harvested at 
various wild collection locations (Section 2.1). Fe rtile thalli branches with the highest 
density of cystocarps were removed and cleaned of e piphytes with sterile seawater, 
deionised water and sterilised cotton wool, then su rface sterilised using a 1 % (v/v) 
Betadine solution and rinsed with sterile seawater (Lawlor  et al.  1991). The thalli were 
then placed into Erlenmeyer flasks with 1 L sterile  seawater (DFSW) at 18 ± 2 oC on a 
12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 for 1 d. 
 
The fertile branches were blotted, weighed and then  exposed to three different 
spore induction treatments including temperature, d ark and osmotic pressure. In the Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 46  temperature treatment the algae were exposed to 4 oC for 40 h by refrigerating the thalli 
in plastic trays covered with moist newspaper. In t he dark treatment the algae were kept 
within the Erlenmeyer flask cultures and placed in complete darkness for 40 h. For the 
osmotic pressure treatment the algal thalli were ha nd rinsed for 20 min under flowing 
deionised water. After the respective treatments, t he fertile branches were placed in 
Petri dishes with 50 mL sterile seawater (DFSW) and  a microscope slide on the bottom. 
The 3 macroalgal species examined had 3 replicate P etri dishes apiece for each of the 
induction treatments, all cultured at two temperatu res of 18 ± 2 oC and 25 ± 2 oC with 
two irradiances of 10 and 100 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 for both temperatures. The fertile 
branches were left for 24 h to allow the cystocarp time to release the carpospores. 
 
The number of carpospores settled within a field of  view (40x magnification) 
was then counted on the microscope slide from the b ottom of the Petri dish to determine 
how many spores had been released per gram of alga.  Spore release from the three 
macroalgae, G. chilensis , Hypnea  and P. mertensii  was compared by a three-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey Post-Hoc test taking the treatment, 
temperature and irradiance as fixed factors. 
 
3.2.2 Red Macroalgal Protoplast Production 
Initial Enzyme Experiment 
Gracilaria flagelliformis  was harvested from the Leeuwin collection site 
(Section 2.1) and the young branches cleaned of epi phytes with sterile seawater, 
deionised water and cotton wool. The branches were then placed in Erlenmeyer flasks 
with 1 L of f/2 medium (Section 2.2, DFSW) at 18 ± 2 oC and exposed to a 12 h:12 h, 
light:dark cycle at 50 µmol photons.m -2.s -1, 1 d prior to protoplast production. 
 
The protocol for isolating a large biomass of proto plasts from the agarophyte 
algae genera Gracilaria , using agarase and commercial enzymes was modified  from the 
procedure of Araki et al.  (1998). The enzymes Cellulase Onozuka RS, Macerozy me  Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 47  R-10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical Ind. Co, Ltd), agarase,  papain and mannitol (Sigma-
Aldrich) were dissolved separately in two different  base treatments, sterile seawater 
(DFSW) and deionised water (osmotic treatment), the n filter-sterilised through a 0.2 µm 
membrane filter. Young G. flagelliformis  branches (1 g blotted wet weight of branches, 
3 – 5 cm in length) were pre-treated with 30 mL pap ain solution (20 mM  
2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 6.5 – 7.5, containing 5 % (w/v) 
papain and 0.7 M mannitol) in a 100 mL beaker and i ncubated at 25 ± 2 oC for 30 min 
with agitation on a reciprocal shaker (30 rev.min -1). Treated branches were then washed 
three times with f/2 medium containing 0.7 M mannit ol (osmotic stabiliser) and cut into 
1 – 2 mm fragments. Fragments totalling 0.5 g were treated with 10 mL of the agarase 
enzyme mixture (Table 6) in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flas k at 25 ± 2 oC and agitated in the 
dark for 150 min (30 rev.min -1). 
 
The reaction mixture consisting of the G. flagelliformis  fragments treated by the 
agarase enzyme mixture was then filtered through a 45 µm nylon mesh and the 
protoplasts collected by centrifugation at 190 g fo r 5 min. The pellet was gently  
re-suspended in 2 mL of f/2 medium containing 0.7 M  mannitol and the number of 
protoplasts counted using a haemocytometer. The pro toplasts isolated from  
G. flagelliformis  by the two enzyme base treatments (3 replicates ea ch), sterile seawater 
and deionised water (osmotic treatment), directly f ollowing isolation and their survival 
after 33 h in culture were both compared by analysi s of variance (one-way ANOVA).

 48  Protoplast Isolation from 3 Red Macroalgal Species 
Three red macroalgal species, Gracilaria  sp., Hypnea  sp. and Laurencia  sp. 
were harvested from the various collection sites (S ection 2.1) and cleaned of epiphytes 
with sterile seawater, deionised water, cotton wool  and a Betadine solution (1 %, v/v). 
Young branches were then placed in Erlenmeyer flask s with 1 L modified Provasoli 
enriched seawater medium plus GeO 2 (Section 2.2, DFSW), to provide a balanced 
marine growth medium specifically designed for macr oalgal cultures rather than the 
universal f/2 medium used in the Initial Enzyme Exp eriment (Section 3.2.2). The 
cultures remained at 18 ± 2 oC and were exposed to a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle  at  
50 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 for 1 week, then dark adapted for 1 d prior to pro toplast 
production. 
 
The protocol for isolating protoplasts from the thr ee red macroalgal species 
followed that of the Initial Enzyme Experiment (Sec tion 3.2.2) with minor 
modifications. The enzymes were all dissolved separ ately in deionised water, then filter-
sterilised through a 0.45 µm membrane filter. Young algal branches 1 – 2 cm lo ng  
(1.5 g blotted wet weight of each alga) were pre-tr eated with the papain solution and 
incubated in the dark at 22 ± 2 oC for 30 min. Treated branches were washed three ti mes 
with modified Provasoli enriched seawater medium co ntaining 0.7 M mannitol and 
fragments of each algae (0.3 g) immersed in the aga rase enzyme mixture (Table 6) at  
22 ± 2 oC. The reaction mixture of treated algal fragments in the agarase enzyme mixture 
was filtered through a 100 µm nylon mesh and after centrifuging, the pellet was  washed 
and re-centrifuged twice more before being gently r e-suspended in 1 mL modified 
Provasoli enriched seawater medium containing 0.7 M  mannitol. The numbers of 
isolated protoplasts were then counted immediately and after 14 h using a 
haemocytometer. 
 
Once the re-suspended protoplasts (1 mL modified Pr ovasoli enriched seawater 
medium containing 0.7 mM mannitol) had been counted  for the second time, the 
protoplast culture was then transferred into 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with fresh 10 mL 
modified Provasoli enriched seawater medium contain ing 0.7 M mannitol and cultured Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 49  at 22 ± 2 oC on a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle at 20 µmol photons.m -2.s -1. The mannitol 
was gradually removed from the medium during subcul turing by replacing the medium 
with new medium at lower concentrations of mannitol , so as to not impair cell division. 
The initial protoplast yields (time = 0) from the 3  macroalgal species (3 replicates each) 
were compared by analysis of variance (one-way ANOV A) and the survival of 
protoplasts in culture over time assessed by a Pear son Product Moment Correlation 
analysis. 
 
3.2.3 Vegetative Propagation of Red Macroalgae 
Preliminary Vegetative Fragment Experiment 
Gracilaria  sp. was harvested from the Mistaken Island collect ion site (Section 
2.1) and placed in Erlenmeyer flasks with 1 L, f/2 medium (Section 2.2, DFSW) under 
aeration at 18 ± 2 oC and exposed to a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 3 5 µmol  
photons.m -2.s -1, for 2 weeks. Thalli pieces of approximately 5 cm in length were cleaned 
of epiphytes with sterile cotton wool, surface ster ilised with a 1 % (v/v) Betadine 
solution and then rinsed with sterile seawater. 
 
The cleaned thalli pieces were cut by razor blade i nto 5 – 7 mm fragments and 
placed in Erlenmeyer flasks with 150 mL f/2 medium.  The growth of Gracilaria  
fragments was examined over 2 weeks at two temperat ures (15 ± 2 oC and 18 ± 2 oC) in 
the natural range of juvenile greenlip abalone (Sec tion 5.2.3). The effect of irradiance 
was also tested by using two irradiances, 75 and 35 0 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 on 12 h:12h, 
light:dark cycle that reflect the conditions in aba lone nursery tanks (Section 5.2.3). 
 
Vegetative Fragment Experiment 
Young branches of the red macroalgae Gracilaria  sp., Hypnea  sp. and Laurencia  
sp. were harvested from various collection sites (S ection 2.1). The culturing, 
cleaning/sterilising and fragment preparation proce dures followed that of the 
Preliminary Vegetative Fragment Experiment (Section  3.2.3), except that modified Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 50  Provasoli enriched seawater medium plus GeO 2 (Section 2.2, DFSW) was used instead 
of f/2 medium and exchanged on a weekly basis. The algal fragments were cultured  
(12 replicate cultures for each specie) for 11 week s at 15 ± 2 oC and under 75 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1 on a 12 h:12h, light:dark cycle (Section 3.3.3). A  Friedman Repeated 
Measures Analysis of Variance on Ranks was carried out to compare both the growth 
rate and survival of the 3 macroalgal species fragm ent cultures over the 11-week period. 
If there were significant differences (p<0.05) betw een species a Pairwise Multiple 
Comparison Procedure (q values) was completed. 
 
3.3 RESULTS 
3.3.1 Carpospores of Red Macroalgae 
In the preliminary experiment only 8.69 % of the fr esh P. mertensii  thalli 
collected from the field had fertile fronds. A spor e yield of 4.05 x10 3 spores.g -1 of 
thallus was recorded after 2 h, increasing to 4.75 x10 3 spores.g -1 after 4 h. 
 
Carpospores of 20 – 50 µm diameter (Figure 4) were successfully liberated f rom 
the three red macroalgal species by all of the indu ction treatments, temperature, dark 
and osmotic pressure (Figure 5). The mean carpospor e production was significantly 
different between species with Hypnea  producing 67.23 ± 10.19 x10 3 carpospores.g -1, 
while P . mertensii  released 43.61 ± 4.38 x10 3 carpospores.g -1 and G. chilensis  liberated 
17.09 ± 2.46 x10 3 carpospores.g -1 (F (df 2,105) =30.904, p<0.05). The mean number of 
carpospores released for each alga was significantl y different from both of the other two 
macroalgal species (Tukey, p<0.05). The variation i n carpospore release between each 
macroalgae was clearly demonstrated by the change o f scale (y axis) in Figure 5. The 
temperature treatment and culture conditions of 25 ± 2 oC and 10 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 
liberated the most carpospores ( Hypnea , 140.21 ± 19.73 x10 3 carpospores.g -1), while the 
osmotic pressure treatment and culture conditions o f 18 ± 2 oC and 10 µmol  
photons.m -2.s -1 resulted in the least number of carpospores releas ed ( G. chilensis ,  
9.08 ± 0.89 x10 3 carpospores.g -1) (Figure 5). 
 Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 51  On a species level the osmotic pressure treatment r esulted in the lowest level of 
carpospore liberation of the three induction treatm ents for both G. chilensis  and Hypnea , 
however for P. mertensii  it produced the highest number of released carposp ores 
(Figure 5). In fact, the osmotic pressure treatment  resulted in significantly less Hypnea  
carpospores being released (F (df 2,33) =14.903, p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05)), but was able to 
liberate a significantly greater number of P. mertensii  carpospores (F (df 2,33) =7.314, 
p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05)) when compared with the othe r two induction treatments. On 
the other hand G. chilensis  carpospore release induced by the dark treatment w as 
significantly greater than both the temperature and  osmotic pressure treatments  
(F (df 2,33) =13.021, p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05)). 
 
Culture temperature and irradiance affected carposp ore release differently for 
each species (Figure 5). However, the carpospore re lease from the three species, over all 
three of the induction treatments were not signific antly different between the two 
culture temperatures of 18 and 25 oC (F (df 1,106) =0.71, p=0.401), or the two irradiances of 
10 and 100 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 (F (df 1,106) =1.631, p=0.204).

Initial Enzyme Experiment 
A yield of 9.40 ± 1.03 x10 5 protoplasts was obtained from 1 g blotted wet 
weight of G. flagelliformis  fragments digested using the enzyme mixture with t he 
osmotic treatment base, deionised water (Table 7). This was significantly greater than 
the number of protoplasts isolated utilising the en zyme mixture dissolved in sterile 
seawater. The survival of protoplasts at 33 h obtai ned using the osmotic treatment base 
was not significantly greater than for the sterile seawater treatment base (Table 7).

Protoplast Isolation from 3 Red Macroalgal Species 
Protoplasts such as that shown in Figure 6 were suc cessfully produced from all 
three of the red macroalgae tested. Gracilaria  yielded the greatest number of  
protoplasts at 28.83 ± 8.69 x10 5 protoplasts.g -1, closely followed by Hypnea  with  
26.16 ± 18.84 x10 5 protoplasts.g -1 (Figure 7). Laurencia  produced 5.52 ± 0.64 x10 5 
protoplasts.g -1, which was significantly less than that isolated f rom both Gracilaria   
(F (df 1,4) =464.53, p<0.05) and Hypnea  (F (df 1,4) =107.40, p<0.05) thalli. 
 
Once the re-suspended protoplasts were placed in cu lture, cell wall regeneration 
and division were visually monitored during the cou nts of intact protoplasts, with no Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 54  cell division recorded over the 142 h period. Proto plast survival for all three red 
macroalgal species decreased at each subculture tim e interval (Figure 7), with the 
protoplast survival curves all significantly, posit ively correlated ( G.  versus H.  (R=0.937,

 55  3.3.3 Vegetative Propagation of Red Macroalgae 
Preliminary Vegetative Fragment Experiment 
During the first week of culture the Gracilaria  fragments lost biomass, whereas 
in the second week the biomass increased in all tre atments (Table 8). New bud 
formation was also evident on the Gracilaria  fragments as shown in Figure 8. The 
highest specific growth rate of Gracilaria  fragments over the 2-week period was  
4.42 %.day -1 in the 15 ± 2 oC, 75 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 treatment (Table 8). 
 
Vegetative Fragment Experiment 
Fragment culture was successfully established and m aintained over 11 weeks for 
both Gracilaria  and Hypnea . The Gracilaria  fragments exhibited a very slow first week 
of growth but then grew at 0.035 ± 0.003 µg.day -1 during the trial (Figure 9a). The 
Hypnea  fragments had the highest growth rates during week  3 to 8 and averaged a 
growth rate of 0.041 ± 0.003 µg.day -1 over the 11-week culture period (Figure 9b). A 
few Gracilaria and Hypnea  fragments were able to adhere to the bottom of the  culture 
flasks throughout the trial. 
 
The Laurencia  fragments displayed substantial variation in growt h with only  
2 weeks of positive growth and an overall trial gro wth rate of -0.084 ± 0.051 µg.day -1 
(Figure 9c). Growth rates of the macroalgal fragmen ts over the 11-week culture period 
were significantly different (F (df 2,33) =9.556, p<0.05), with the Laurencia  fragments 
exhibiting a significantly slower growth rate than both the Gracilaria  (q=3.77, p<0.05) 
and the Hypnea  (q=4.33, p<0.05) fragments. The growth rate, or in  the Laurencia  
fragments case the decay rate in the first week of culture was -0.446 ± 0.007 µg.day -1, 
while an extremely low fragment survival of 12.5 % was recorded. The Laurencia  
fragment survival was also highly variable, reachin g 75 % at week 6 and averaging  
53.3 % over the culture period (Figure 9c). The sur vival rates of the macroalgal 
fragments over the 11-week culture period were sign ificantly different (F (df 2,33) =15.943, 
p<0.05), with the Laurencia  fragments producing significantly lower survival t han both Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 56  the Gracilaria  (q=3.5, p<0.05) and the Hypnea  (q=5.5, p<0.05), which both had close to

 58  3.4 DISCUSSION 
3.4.1 Carpospores of Red Macroalgae 
Only a small percentage of the fresh P. mertensii  material (8.69 %) harvested for 
the preliminary spore experiment (Section 3.3.1) co nsisted of thalli with reproductive 
structures, indicating that the majority of thalli were vegetative or in the gametophyte 
phase (Destombe  et al.  1989). Fertility of Plocamium cartilagineum  has been shown to 
be less than 10 % at some times of the year, varyin g considerably with season, depth 
and plant size, while also being dominated by tetra sporophyte (Kain 1982, 1986). The 
G. chilensis , Hypnea  and P. mertensii  collection for the large carpospore production 
experiment (Section 3.2.1) targeted carposporophyte  thalli and had variable amounts of 
cystocarp present. Hypnea charoides  populations have shown a major dominance of 
vegetative and tetrasporophytic plants with very fe w carposporophytes (Kong & Ang 
2004). Le Gall et al.  (2004) found that of the total amount of P. palmata  harvested from 
the field, only 10 % was represented by fertile pie ces. The abundance of reproductive 
plants can be highly variable to the point where te trasporophytes and/or 
carposporophytes are absent in the natural populati on at certain times of the year 
(Orduña-Rojas & Robledo 2002, Martín  et al.  2011), therefore field collection of 
macroalgae for spore liberation experiments needs t o be time and target specific. 
 
The combined temperature and dark treatment used in  the preliminary spore 
experiment yielded 4.75 x10 3 spores.g -1 from P. mertensii , however greater carpospore 
liberation was possible using the different inducti on treatments in the large carpospore 
production experiment (Section 3.3.1). Temperature and dark treatments applied 
separately yielded 10 fold the number of spores rel eased, but over an extended period of 
time. Osmotic pressure induction produced the highe st yield of carpospores for  
P. mertensii  across both experiments. This was the opposite to G. chilensis  and Hypnea , 
which liberated higher carpospore numbers using the  temperature and dark treatments 
than the osmotic pressure induction treatment. Hypnea  yielded the greatest number of 
carpospores of the three species when induced by te mperature. Mshigeni (1976) also 
used a combination of temperature and irradiance to  liberate spores from Hypnea 
cervicornis  and Hypnea chordacea . Even though the Polysiphonia-type, triphasic life  
history of these red macroalgae allows the use of e ither carposporophytes or Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 59  tetrasporophytes to release spores for the producti on of sporelings, carpospores were 
used because of their robust vigour, growth rate an d diploid nature of the derived 
tetrasporophyte sporelings (Polifrone  et al.  2006, Mantri  et al.  2009). 
 
The lower numbers of carpospores released by G. chilensis  in the osmotic 
pressure treatment compared to the dark treatment, may be due to a high resistance to 
osmotic changes (Alveal  et al.  1997). Carpospore shedding can be induced by salin ity 
changes, but culture temperature and irradiance hav e been shown to affect carpospore 
liberation in Gracilaria cornea  and G. pacifica  (Orduña-Rojas & Robledo 1999, Garza-
Sánchez  et al.  2000), while temperature and photoperiod, rather t han the induction 
through osmotic shock and drying significantly affe cted G. cornea  carpospore release 
(Guzmán-Urióstegui & Robledo 1999). Dark treatment induced the greatest carpospore 
liberation from G. chilensis  in this study compared to the temperature and osmo tic 
pressure treatments. Photoperiod has been shown to affect G. corticata  carpospore 
release, with the greatest liberation occurring in periods of 20 to 24 h darkness, while 
Gracilaria foliifera  carpospore release was optimal in dark or low ligh t conditions 
(Umamaheswara Rao 1976, Friedlander & Dawes 1984). 
 
Gracilaria chilensis  and Hypnea  thalli remained intact throughout the 
experiment and were placed directly back into cultu re, whereas the P. mertensii  thalli 
degraded during culture and this may have impacted on the release of carpospores. The 
degradation of P. mertensii  in culture made it difficult to use this species i n the 
protoplast production (Section 3.2.2) and fragment propagation (Section 3.2.3) 
experiments. It also has implications for repetitiv e carpospore releases as the other two 
macroalgal species could be placed back in culture and then utilised to induce the 
release of carpospores at a later point in time. Ca rpospore liberation can occur over 
several days after induction, with some Gracilaria  species having a 3 to 4 d delay until 
maximum release (Guzmán-Urióstegui & Robledo 1999, Garza-Sánchez  et al.  2000, 
Mantri  et al.  2009). The delay in spore release and the ability to utilise cultured 
macroalgae would allow carpospore release to be ind uced over multiple days, at various 
times throughout the year without the need for wild , fertile macroalgal thalli harvest. Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 60  The variation in spore liberation between the three  species and the three 
induction treatments create issues when large amoun ts of spore biomass are required to 
seed the vertical PVC plates in the abalone nursery  system. Spore densities of  
200 spore.cm -2 are deemed appropriate to reduce over crowding and  competition for 
light, while also supplying appropriate densities o f macroalgal sporelings within an 
abalone hatchery (Alveal  et al.  1997, Le Gall  et al.  2004). Based on the result that 3 kg 
of fresh alga ( P. palmata ) seeded 1 m 2 in the Le Gall et al.  (2004) study, 21.6 kg of alga 
biomass would be required to seed one of the nurser y tanks used in the abalone  
feeding trial (Section 2.4.1), let alone the tens o f tonnes to seed a commercial  
nursery system. Utilising the mean number of carpos pores isolated from Hypnea   
(67.23 ± 10.19 x10 3 carpospores.g -1) and with a 35 % germination rate, only 1.84 kg of  
carposporophyte material would be required to seed sporelings at 200 sporeling.cm -2 in 
an abalone feeding trial nursery tank. 
 
Acquiring a regular, large supply of fertile algal material may be difficult given 
the high percentage (91.4 %) of vegetative P. mertensii  harvested for the preliminary 
spore experiment and the targeted collection for th e large carpospore production 
experiment (Section 3.3.1). To overcome this, cultu res could be developed and 
maintained to produce the required fertile biomass.  However, the lower overall 
carpospore liberation from G. chilensis  across the three treatments could have been due 
to the macroalga developing cystocarp in culture ra ther than in the wild as with the  
P. mertensii  and Hypnea  collected. If this were the case, then there would  be 
ramifications for utilising cultured algae for carp ospore production. However, complete 
life histories of red macroalgae such as Gracilaria  species have been cultured under 
laboratory conditions, indicating cultured algae do  have potential for carpospore 
production (Guimarães  et al.  1999, Avila  et al.  2011). 
 
If enough fertile algal material can be attained an d carpospores liberated, the 
vertical PVC plates used in the nursery system coul d affect spore settlement rates. Red 
algal propagules are non-motile and the majority of  germination experiments are 
conducted on horizontal surfaces (Fletcher & Callow  1992, Buschmann  et al.  1999, Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 61  Orduña-Rojas & Robledo 1999), which would most like ly produce higher settlement 
rates compared to settlement on the vertical PVC pl ates. To overcome this settlement 
problem, gentle aeration of the water could maintai n the spores in the water column for 
a sufficient period of time to allow attachment to the PVC plates. Even with a lower 
settlement rate, the ability of carpospores to sett le and attach to the PVC plates 
unassisted in the nursery system would allow red ma croalgae to be provided to juvenile 
abalone. This process would require very few consum ables, while equipment for spore 
cultivation is relatively simple (Alveal  et al.  1997), making it a cheap and easy method 
for commercial abalone farms to seed red macroalgae  onto the PVC plates in the 
nursery system. 
 
The spore liberation from Hypnea  would be sufficient to produce a sporeling 
diet, and to guarantee this level of release multip le induction treatments could be 
performed over an extended period of time. Overall,  with the required amount of 
suitable fertile red macroalga, appropriate inducti on treatments and culture conditions, 
carpospores can be used to create an alternative di et for juvenile abalone in the later 
nursery phase. 
 
3.4.2 Red Macroalgal Protoplast Production 
Protoplast production as a propagation method can b e used on a variety of 
Rhodophyta species as indicated by the isolation of  protoplasts from all four macroalgae 
used in this study (Section 3.3.2). However, G. flagelliformis , Gracilaria , Hypnea  and 
Laurencia  yielded protoplasts with varying degrees of succes s. For example, 
immediately after isolation the number of protoplas ts obtained ranged from  
5.52 x10 5 protoplasts.g -1 for Laurencia  up to 2.88 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1 for Gracilaria . 
The protoplast yields from the two Gracilaria  species tested are comparable  
to that of other Gracilaria  species studied; including G. asiatica , which has  
produced 4 – 8 x10 5 protoplasts.g -1 (Yan & Wang 1993), while G. lemanaeformis   
and G. tikvahiae  yielded 3 – 10 x10 5 protoplasts.g -1 (Cheney  et al.  1986), and  
G. lemanaeformis , G. sordida , G. tenuistipitata  and G. verrucosa  yielded from  
10 5 to 10 7 protoplasts.g -1 (Björk  et al.  1990, Mollet  et al.  1995). The range in protoplast Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 62  yields for a variety of different Gracilaria  species, across numerous studies all using 
slightly different enzyme mixtures to digest the th alli has been summarised in Gupta et 
al.  (2011). Some macroalgal species from other red alg al Families have been  
shown to produce slightly higher numbers of viable protoplasts, with Bangia 
atropurpurea  yielding 2.85 x10 7 protoplasts.g -1 (Araki  et al.  1994), P. palmata   
4 – 6 x10 7 protoplasts.g -1 (Liu  et al.  1992) and Grateloupia sparsa  and Grateloupia 
turuturu  yielding up to 1 and 1.5 x10 7 protoplasts.g -1, respectively (Chen & Chiang 
1994, Lafontaine  et al.  2011). Morphologically simpler algae can produce a  very wide 
range in the numbers of protoplasts isolated, start ing from similar values to that 
recorded for the four red macroalgae species used i n this study. For example,  
protoplast yields from species of the green alga Monostroma  can range  
from 10 – 100 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1, while Enteromorpha  species have produced  
4 – 95 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1 and Ulva  species 4.5 – 88 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1 (Rusig & 
Cosson 2001, Uppalapati & Fujita 2002, Reddy  et al.  2006). Other research on Ulva  
species has reported 3.23 x10 7 protoplasts.g -1 for U. fasciata  (Chen & Shih 2000), up to  
10 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1 for U. conglobata , 6 x10 6 protoplasts.g -1 for U. pertusa  (Reddy  
et al.  1989) and more than x10 7 protoplasts.g -1 for U. rigida  (Björk  et al.  1992). 
 
In the Initial Enzyme Experiment (Section 3.2.2) di ssolving all the enzymes in 
deionised water as an osmotic treatment enhanced pr otoplast isolation, producing 
significantly greater numbers of protoplasts than u sing sterile seawater as an enzyme 
base. The two enzyme solution bases, sterile seawat er and deionised water, were tested 
to determine if individually they could increase pr otoplast yields compared with the 
commonly used enzyme base of 60 % seawater, 40 % de ionised water (Cheney  et al.  
1986, Björk  et al.  1990, Yan & Wang 1993, Yeong  et al.  2008). Due to the increase in 
protoplast yield, the osmotic treatment base was us ed in the Protoplast Isolation from  
3 Red Macroalgal Species experiment (Section 3.2.2) . 
 
Despite all four macroalgae tested producing compar able numbers of protoplasts 
to the literature, no protoplast division was evide nt in any of the cultures. Even though 
deionised water as the enzyme base produced a great er number of protoplasts, this Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 63  treatment could have affected cell division and pla ntlet development. To overcome this, 
either more work needs to be done to determine the optimum level of osmotic stabiliser, 
as it has been found that protoplasts are unable to  be isolated without the addition of an 
osmotic stabilizer (Araki  et al.  1998), or by simply reverting back to the common 
enzyme base of seawater and deionised water in a ra tio of 60:40. 
 
Protoplast production as a propagation method only requires small amounts of 
red macroalgal biomass to produce plantlets, as 2.8 8 ± 0.87 x10 6 protoplasts were 
produced from 1 g of Gracilaria . This removes the limitations associated with 
collection of reproductive plants for spore product ion, as fertile thalli were not required 
to produce protoplasts. Substituting the density of  200 sporelings.cm -2 (Alveal  et al.  
1997, Le Gall  et al.  2004) identified in Section 3.1.1 for protoplasts,  the amount of red 
macroalgal material required for protoplast isolati on to seed one of the abalone feeding 
trial nursery tanks (Section 2.4.1) can be determin ed. Given the number of protoplasts 
isolated from 1 g of Gracilaria  and a hypothetical, low regeneration rate of 1 % t o take 
into account the high variability of plantlet devel opment, only 1.5 kg of fresh material 
would be required. This amount of red macroalgal th alli was less than the 1.84 kg of 
carposporophyte material (Section 3.4.1) needed to seed an abalone feeding trial nursery 
tank with plantlets at the same density, through sp ore liberation. 
 
Given the lack of protoplast cell division and subs equent formation of whole 
plantlets, protoplast production appears significan tly limited for use in culturing a diet 
for juvenile abalone; specifically when compared to  carpospore production, as 
carpospores can readily attach and form sporelings on substrata. For protoplast isolation 
to be useful in abalone aquaculture at least a smal l percentage of protoplasts need to 
exhibit cell division, form into callus-like cell m asses and subsequently produce whole 
plantlets. Even though plantlet formation has been shown to occur in other studies, it 
can be highly variable and in more complex macroalg ae this process can take 
considerable time, with species such as Gracilaria changii  and G. asiatica  requiring up 
to 2 – 3 months to produce plantlets (Yan & Wang 19 93, Yeong  et al.  2008). This 
would require an extensive culturing procedure to b e developed at an abalone farm with Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 64  protoplasts produced and cultured in separate syste ms to the abalone, until they are 
developed enough to self-attach to the PVC plates i n the abalone nursery system. If the 
protoplasts cannot self-attach through callus forma tions and develop into plantlets, 
artificial adhesion protocols would need to be deve loped to aid the attachment process. 
Procedures such as immobilising the protoplasts in beads of calcium alginate to create a 
seed stock facilitating macroalgal culture (Rusig &  Cosson 2001); or immobilising the 
plant material in alginate beads before being treat ed with the protoplast isolation 
enzyme, to form the protoplasts inside the alginate  (Aoyagi & Tanaka 1999), could be 
adapted to artificially adhere the macroalgal proto plasts onto the PVC plates in the 
nursery system. 
 
The propagation method of protoplast production rem ains very specialised and 
with the high costs of enzymes, it’s both an extrem ely time consuming and costly 
procedure, even without having to incorporate addit ional artificial adhesion protocols. 
Given that specialised culture equipment, laborator y facilities and skilled technicians 
are required to produce protoplasts, it would be di fficult to incorporate protoplasts into a 
macroalgal diet for juvenile abalone in the nursery  system. Even though protoplast 
isolation can be extremely useful for creating sing led celled cultures of macroalgae for 
laboratory studies on physiological, developmental,  genetic improvement and metabolic 
engineering (Reddy  et al.  2008a); the variability in the number of protoplas ts isolated, 
inadequate regeneration rate into plantlets, time a nd costs associated, makes it 
commercially unviable to use protoplast propagation  methods at an abalone farm. 
Therefore, protoplast production was not explored f urther to create an alternative diet 
for juvenile abalone in the later nursery phase. 
 
3.4.3 Vegetative Propagation of Red Macroalgae 
In the Preliminary Vegetative Fragment Experiment, Gracilaria  was only able to 
produce positive growth over the 2 weeks in the 15 ± 2 oC, 75 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 
culture treatment and the 18 ± 2 oC, 75 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 culture treatment (Section 
3.3.3). This indicates an irradiance of 350 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 was unsuitable for 
Gracilaria  fragment culture. Given the culture treatment of 1 5 ± 2 oC and 75 µmol Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 65  photons.m -2.s -1 produced the highest Gracilaria  fragment growth rate of 4.42 %.day -1, 
these conditions were used for the Vegetative Fragm ent Experiment (Section 3.2.3). 
These results compare with the indoor cultivation c onditions of 10 – 14 oC and an 
irradiance of 50 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 recommended for G. skottsbergii  fragments 
(Buschmann  et al.  2004). 
 
Gracilaria  produced negative growth rates in all treatments d uring the first week 
of the Preliminary Vegetative Fragment Experiment, while slow growth rates were 
recorded during the first week of the Vegetative Fr agment Experiment (Section 3.3.3). 
This was due to degradation of the excised section on the macroalga fragments edge 
while wound healing occurred. A similar decrease in  biomass has also been recorded for 
G. skottsbergii  fragments, where the exposed margin of the fragmen ts degraded during 
the first 2 weeks, before specific growth rates of up to 1 %.day -1 were attained 
(Hernández-González  et al.  2007). Gelidium  sp. has also exhibited slower growth rates 
for 1 – 2 mm fragments during the first 2 weeks of culture compared to the following  
4 weeks, indicating a period of wound healing (Titl yanov & Titlyanova 2006). Hypnea  
however, recovered quickly from being cut into frag ments in the Vegetative Fragment 
Experiment (Section 3.3.3), as the first week of gr owth was not substantially lower than 
other weekly growth rates. 
 
Gracilaria  and Hypnea  fragments were both able to maintain growth rates of 
over 0.035 µg.day -1 throughout the 11-week culture period. Comparable growth rates 
for G. chilensis  fragments can theoretically be achieved when the s pecific growth versus 
fragment length curve presented by Santelices & Var ela (1995) was extrapolated to 
include an initial fragment size of 5 – 7 mm. The a bility of the Gracilaria  and Hypnea  
fragments to produce viable cultures was further hi ghlighted by the high fragment 
survival (>98.5 %) throughout the experiment. 
 
Laurencia  had variable survival, ranging from a maximum of 7 5 % during the 
culture period to 12.5 % in the first week. The ext remely low survival in the first week Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 66  indicated Laurencia  had limited ability to heal the wound created by f ragmentation, 
while the increase in survival to 40 – 75 % for the  remainder of the culture period 
showed the extended time frame wound healing can ta ke. This has also been shown in 
Laurencia  sp. explants (fragments 10 mm) that developed call us formations in the 
wounds and then buds after 30 d (Robaina  et al.  1990). The constant mortality of 
Laurencia  fragments had a detrimental effect on growth rates  and resulted in the high 
variability and multiple, negative weekly growth ra tes. 
 
One potential cause of the Laurencia  fragment mortality could be secondary 
metabolites, which are natural compounds produced b y marine algae that are not 
necessary for the survival of cells themselves but responsible for a wide range of 
properties (e.g. Cabrita  et al.  2010). Rhodophyta species produce suites of haloge nated 
secondary metabolites with Laurencia  particularly well know for their production  
(e.g. Fenical 1975, Erickson 1983). In fact, specif ic Laurencia  species have been 
reported to produce such a diversity of secondary m etabolites that it causes geographic 
variations, where morphologically similar but chemi cally distinct populations can be 
found (e.g. Fenical 1976, Masuda  et al.  1997). This diversity also extends to potentially 
toxic, bioactive secondary metabolites that accumul ate in refractile inclusions and when 
the fragments are cut, causing the cells to rupture , the toxic secondary metabolites are 
released into the culture medium. This process coul d have implications for the growth 
and survival of fragments within media and subseque ntly explain the performance of the 
Laurencia  fragments in culture. 
 
The culture temperature of 15 ± 2 oC used in this vegetative fragment experiment 
(Section 3.2.3) could be another possible reason fo r the limited growth rates of 
fragments cut from Laurencia  thalli. Various Laurencia  species have shown growth and 
bud regeneration from small fragments (<10 mm) in c ulture at temperatures ranging 
from 10 to 32 oC. However, these studies all produced very limited  Laurencia  fragment 
growth at culture temperatures (10 to 16 oC) similar to that of the 15 oC used in this 
experiment, while maximum fragment growth rates whe re achieved at much higher 
temperatures of between 25 and 30 oC (Kuwano  et al.  1998, Nishihara  et al.  2004, Shen  Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 67  et al.  2010, Sudatti  et al.  2011). This indicates that higher culture temperat ures should 
be utilised to optimise fragment culture of Laurencia , however, this may not be possible 
when the fragments are incorporated as a diet for t he temperate water species (<18 oC) 
of greenlip abalone. 
 
Fragments of both Hypnea  and Gracilaria  were able to attach to the bottom of 
the culture flask through the production of new cel ls at the cut edge during the wound 
healing process. This natural attachment process ha s considerable benefits, as the ability 
for self-adhesion to a substratum allows the red ma croalgal fragments to attach directly 
to the vertical PVC plates in the nursery system, c reating a simple low maintenance diet 
for juvenile abalone. However, the natural attachme nt only occurred in a few fragments 
throughout the 11-week culture period. Given it can  take at least 2 – 3 d to produce cells 
at the cut margins, let alone 2 to 3 weeks to compl ete wound healing and show signs of 
growth (Titlyanov & Titlyanova 2006, Hurtado & Bite r 2007), this would be an 
extremely inefficient means of adhering fragments t o the vertical plates. Even with this 
natural attachment to substrata in culture, the pro cess needs to be artificially accelerated 
so that all of the fragments used to seed the verti cal PVC plates in the abalone nursery 
system are able to attach and grow. Otherwise, subs tantial biomass of the algal 
fragments will not attach to the plates and the per centage that does, would take an 
extremely long time to produce a patchy algal distr ibution over the plates. Therefore, 
appropriate adherence protocols need to be develope d to enable any red macroalgal 
fragments to be utilised as a juvenile abalone diet  in the nursery system. 
 
Given fragments can be excised from any part of any  phenotype it removes the 
problems associated with Rhodophyta triphasic life history and allows cultured algal 
biomass to be utilised. An important benefit of fra gment regeneration and growth was 
that macroalgal biomass can be easily cultured and this would reduce the reliance on 
collection from wild populations. It could also all ow the biochemical composition of the 
algae to be manipulated by nutrient enrichment in c ulture, potentially providing juvenile 
abalone with a consistent, nutritionally superior r ed macroalgal diet. Abalone farms 
within Asia, South America and South Africa, that h ave access to large, reliable Chapter 3 – Propagation of Rhodophyta Species 
 68  quantities of algae (Zemke-White & Ohno 1999, Lünin g & Pang 2003) could either 
culture on site or use wild harvest material to cul ture fragments. In Australia the use of 
integrated polyculture systems within the abalone f arm would allow sufficient nutrient 
enriched, appropriate red macroalgal species to be cultured on site, subsequently 
reducing reliance on wild harvest while also helpin g to treat effluent discharge (Neori  et 
al.  2004). 
 
Based on the survival and growth rates obtained in the Vegetative Fragment 
Experiment (Section 3.3.3), Hypnea  and Gracilaria  were both propagated successfully 
by vegetative fragmentation and are considered suit able for utilisation in juvenile 
abalone nutrition. By developing an appropriate art ificial adhesion protocol that can 
facilitate the attachment of algae to the PVC plate s in the nursery system, vegetative 
fragments of adult red macroalgal thalli could be u sed as an alternative diet for juvenile 
abalone in the later nursery phase. 
 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 69  CHAPTER 4 
MACROALGAL FRAGMENTS AS A DIET FOR JUVENILE 
GREENLIP ABALONE 
4.1 MACROALGAL FRAGMENT ARTIFICIAL ADHESION PROTOCO LS 
4.1.1 Introduction 
Of the three algal propagation methods examined, ca rpospore liberation and 
vegetative propagation were identified as suitable methods for incorporating red 
macroalgae into a diet for juvenile greenlip abalon e in the nursery system (Section 3.4). 
However unlike carpospore liberation, which allows a large, consistent biomass of 
macroalgae to naturally attach to a substratum, veg etative propagation through 
fragmentation of macroalgal thalli requires some fo rm of artificial adhesion to attach the 
fragments onto the vertical PVC plates used in the commercial abalone nursery system. 
 
Immobilisation techniques used for microorganisms a re artificial fixing/adhesion 
processes that could be adapted to attach the small , red macroalgal fragments onto the 
PVC plates. Active immobilisation includes the use of flocculent agents, chemical 
attachment or gel entrapment; with the latter the m ost extensively used technique for 
algal immobilisation (Moreno-Garrido 2008). Natural  polysaccharides are the most 
appropriate gel entrapment, algal immobilisation te chnique, when compared to synthetic 
polymers and proteins, given the compounds are deri ved from algae and this artificial 
adhesion process was being adapted to produce a die t consumable by juvenile abalone. 
Of the three natural polysaccharides, two (agar and  carrageenan) are obtained from 
Rhodophyta species, while the third (alginate) can be extracted from Phaeophyceae 
species (Moreno-Garrido 2008). 
 
Two of these algae-derived polysaccharides, alginat e and agar are common 
gelling agents used to bind dietary nutrients in ar tificial feeds for abalone consumption. 
Combinations of these two binders can be used, whil e a mixture of agar and gelatine has Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 70  been shown to provide the best water stability of s even different binders over a 24 h 
period (Knauer  et al.  1993). Concentrations of the two binders (alginate  and agar) can 
affect the dietary intake of nutrients by abalone f rom artificial diets, and when used as 
the primary binder they form an expensive component  of the aquaculture feed, which 
can be prohibitive to low cost feed production (Fle ming  et al.  1996, O'Mahoney  et al.  
2011). Both of these gelling agents have also been used to adhere artificial diets onto 
vertical plates, to try and improve settlement and growth rates of postlarval abalone 
(Stott  et al.  2002, 2004b). These artificial adhesion protocols can therefore, be adapted 
to seed fragments of cultured red macroalgae onto t he PVC plates in the abalone nursery 
system. 
 
Substantial work has already been done on the immob ilisation of living cells, 
with the calcium alginate gel matrix one of the mos t widely used techniques (Smidsrød 
& Skjåk-Braek 1990). Generally the immobilisation p rocess consists of mixing the plant 
material with sodium alginate and then calcium chlo ride to form beads of an insoluble 
calcium alginate gel matrix. This method has been s uccessfully used to immobilise a 
range of microalgae, which can then be cultured for  extended periods in the alginate 
matrix (Hertzberg & Jensen 1989, Faafeng  et al.  1994, Romo & Pérez-Martínez 1997). 
Given the algal cells retain their respiratory and photosynthetic activities after 
immobilisation, the long-term storage of algal cell s can greatly improve stock culture 
management (Romo & Pérez-Martínez 1997, Chen 2001).  This has significant 
applications for the aquaculture industry as the im mobilisation technique could allow 
facilities to easily maintain large-volume algal cu ltures for extended periods of time, 
before inoculating tanks with the immobilised algal  beads that slowly leak/release the 
algal material to supply food for the farmed specie . This methodology has already been 
trialled for use in oyster and clam aquaculture (Le beau  et al.  1998, Chen 2003), and 
could aid in the culture and presentation of the re d macroalgal fragments as a juvenile 
abalone diet on the PVC plates in the nursery syste m. 
 
To create the alginate beads that immobilise fragme nts of red macroalgae, the 
fragments are gently mixed with a sodium alginate s olution (2 – 3 % w/v) at room Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 71  temperature and then the alginate/algae mixture gel led by contacting with the calcium 
chloride solution (1 % w/v). The gelled alginate wo uld then be left for 30 min to 1 h so 
that solidification can occur and the immobilised m acroalgal fragments then transferred 
into culture medium and monitored to detect regener ation. However, to adhere the 
fragments of red macroalgae onto the PVC plates in the nursery system, the gelling 
methodology has to be altered to incorporate the pl ates when the alginate/algae mixture 
and the calcium chloride solution bond together. Th is would allow the insoluble calcium 
alginate gel matrix with the fragments suspended in side, to cover the surface of the 
plates and remained attached (Stott  et al.  2002, 2003a, 2003b). Various physical 
methods could achieve this before the alginate was exposed to the calcium chloride 
solution; including painting and dipping the sodium  alginate/algae mixture onto the 
plates or via mechanical means such as Chromatograp hy plate spreaders. The 
concentration of sodium alginate and calcium chlori de, and their effects on wound 
healing of the fragments cut edges are an important  component of the adherence 
method. Particularly, given that when protoplasts a re immobilised in alginate the 
prevention of cell wall regeneration can be importa nt for long term processes (Tanaka  et 
al.  1996, Aoyagi  et al.  1998). Fragment regeneration in the alginate matri x would 
provide a substantial biomass of red macroalgal mat erial on the plates in the abalone 
nursery system. 
 
The second alternative adherence method would be to  suspend the fragments of 
cultured macroalgae within the gelling agent, agar.  Agar a sulphated galactan, without a 
protein source can be consumed by juvenile abalone,  however it leads to reduced 
growth and survival compared with other standard ar tificial diets (Ismail  et al.  2009). 
The agar containing the suspended macroalgal fragme nts can be adhered to the PVC 
plates by either, dipping the plates in the agar/fr agment mixture or by spraying the 
agar/fragment mixture onto the plates. A method of spraying an agar/artificial diet 
mixture, utilising an agar concentration of approxi mately 1 %, could be adapted to suit 
fragments of cultured macroalgae (Stott  et al.  2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d). This spray 
method has been used to test the effect of various refinements in artificial diets on the 
development and nutrition of postlarval abalone (Ch ao  et al.  2010). 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 72  The adhesion of macroalgal fragments to an artifici al substratum was examined 
by utilising the two algae-derived polysaccharide g el entrapment agents, calcium 
alginate gel matrix and agar. Protocols were then d eveloped to incorporate the preferred 
gelling agent into a commercial application method to create a diet for juvenile greenlip 
abalone, by adhering fragments of cultured red macr oalgae onto the PVC plates 
currently used in the nursery system. 
 
4.1.2 Material and Methods 
Comparison of Two Gelling Agents Adhesion 
Algal Material 
The unicellular red alga, Porhyridium purpureum  was used as a test algal 
substitute with both the alginate and agar gelling agents to determine which agent was 
most suitable for adhering algal biomass onto the P VC plates used in the abalone 
nursery system. Porhyridium purpureum  was cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks with 1 L of 
f/2 medium (Section 2.2, DFSW) at 18 ± 2 oC on a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1, then harvested and concentrated by filtration to 9.1 x 10 5 cell.mL -1. 
 
Alginate Gelling Agent 
Intermediate sized PVC plates (20 x 15 cm) were imm ersed in 1 %  
(w/v, DFSW) calcium chloride solution for 30 min. T wo hundred and fifty millilitre of 
P. purpureum  cell suspension was gently mixed with a sodium alg inate solution  
(250 mL, 6 % w/v, DFSW), once it had cooled to room  temperature (25 – 27 oC). The 
alginate/algae mixture with a sodium alginate conce ntration of 3 % was then sprayed 
using a Canyon hand held sprayer onto the PVC plate s pre-soaked in the CaCl 2 solution. 
The plates with the adhering alginate/algae mixture  were then left to dry for 30 min and 
the procedure repeated on the same plates, giving t hem 2 coats of the mixture. 
 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 73  Agar Gelling Agent 
An agar/algae mixture was created by combining 250 mL of 2 % agar solution 
(DFSW) with 250 mL of the P. purpureum  cell suspension, producing a mixture with  
1 % agar concentration. The agar solution was first  allowed to cool to room temperature 
(25 – 27 oC) and once the algal culture had been added to the  agar the resultant mixture 
was sprayed using a Canyon hand held sprayer onto t he intermediate PVC plates  
(20 x 15 cm). The plates with the agar/algae mixtur e adhering were then allowed to 
harden for 30 min and the procedure repeated on the  same plates, giving them 2 coats of 
the mixture. 
 
Gelling Agent/Algae Mixture Culture 
The PVC plates seeded with the alginate/algae mixtu re and the agar/algae 
mixture were placed vertically in a 50 L aquarium w ith f/2 medium (Section 2.2, 
CCFSW) and no aeration, at 18 ± 2 oC on a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1. The two sets of plates were monitored for 6 d to determine the rate of 
gelling agent/algae deterioration, as measured by t he percentage cover of agent and the 
density of P. purpureum  (cells.cm -2) adhered to the plate, both counted within a 
microscope field of view (40x magnification). Direc tly after application the two gelling 
agent percentage covers and algal densities were bo th compared by an Independent  
t-test; paired two samples for means, while a Repea ted Measures Analysis of Variance 
examined the reduction in gelling agent cover over time. 
 
Development of an Agar Adhesion Protocol 
Application by Dipping 
Gracilaria flagelliformis  thalli were harvested from the Leeuwin collection site 
(Section 2.1) and used as a test algal substitute i n developing the agar artificial 
application protocols for adhering macroalgal fragm ents onto the PVC plates. Adult 
thalli of G. flagelliformis  were blended in a commercial food processor to pro duce 
fragments of less than 1 mm in size. The amount of agar powder (Becton Dickinson, 
U.S.A.) dissolved in 1 µm filtered seawater (ICF) was dictated by the volum e ratio of Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 74  agar to algae fragments (i.e. 1:1 or 2:1). One litr e of macroalgal fragments was prepared 
from 800 g blotted wet weight G. flagelliformis  and added to 1 L of 2 % agar solution at 
38 oC, giving the combined mixture a 1 % agar concentra tion. A dipping method was 
utilised as the Canyon hand held sprayer’s nozzle w as too fine to accommodate the  
G. flagelliformis  fragments. Therefore, the resultant agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment 
mixture was placed in a tray and the intermediate P VC plates (20 x 15 cm) hand dipped 
into the mixture, then the mixture allowed to set o n the plates for 2 h. 
 
Ten intermediate plates with the agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment mixture 
adhered, were stood vertically inside a glass aquar ium (50 L) with flow through 
seawater (2 L.min -1, ICF) being aerated by two airlines at the bottom.  Measuring both 
the density of algal fragments and the percentage c over of agar after a week assessed the 
mixtures stability. The presence and absence of juv enile abalone (50 Haliotis laevigata  
of ≈16 mm shell length per aquarium) were examined as t o the effect of abalone on the 
removal of the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture, in 12 replicate aquariums as described 
above. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was con ducted to compare the rate of 
the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture removal from the plates between treatments . 
 
Application by Spraying 
For the spray application a 3.5 mm gravity fed, pot  spray gun powered by 
compressed air was used, as it had a larger nozzle size and a faster application rate than 
the Canyon hand held sprayer. A 400 mL volume of 1. 5 % agar solution at 35 oC had 
200 mL of G. flagelliformis  fragments added (2:1 ratio agar:algae), to give an  agar/algae 
mixture with a 1 % agar concentration. The agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture was then 
applied to the intermediate PVC plates (20 x 15 cm)  using the 3.5 mm pot spray gun. 
 
Given the results of spraying the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture with a 1 % agar 
concentration (Section 4.1.3), different agar conce ntrations were trialled. Two 
concentrations of pure agar solution (0.5 % and 0.7 5 %) at 35 oC were sprayed onto 
intermediate PVC plates with the 3.5 mm pot spray g un. Agar and G. flagelliformis  Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 75  fragments were mixed together to produce two separa te agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixtures 
with 0.5 % and 0.75 % agar concentrations (2:1 rati o agar:algae), then both sprayed 
onto intermediate PVC plates. An abalone feeding tr ial using the aquarium system 
described above (Section 4.1.2) was set up to test the effectiveness of the spraying 
application in adhering the agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment mixture to the PVC plates. 
An agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture at the most effective agar concentration ( 0.75 % with 
a 2:1 ratio at 35 oC, Section 4.1.3) was prepared and sprayed using th e 3.5 mm pot spray 
gun onto the intermediate PVC plates. 
 
Ambient temperature affected the spraying procedure  over time; so three 
concentrations of pure agar solution (0.5 %, 0.75 %  and 1 %) were examined at two air 
temperatures. Spraying occurred at an ambient air t emperature of 23 oC and an increased 
air temperature of 28 oC. Placing the air compressor within a controlled t emperature 
room allowed the air temperature to be increased. A gar solutions and G. flagelliformis  
fragments were combined at a 2:1 ratio, producing a gar/ G. flagelliformis  mixtures with 
agar concentrations of 0.5 %, 0.75 % and 1 %. These  three mixtures were then sprayed 
at the ambient (23 oC) and increased (28 oC) air temperatures onto the intermediate PVC 
plates. 
 
A 5 mm undercoat (direct fed) spray gun was also te sted to spray larger 
macroalgal fragments and reduce solidification of t he agar at lower temperatures. Three 
mixtures of agar and G. flagelliformis  fragments (approximately 2 – 3 mm) were 
produced at a 2:1 ratio, with the mixtures having a gar concentrations of 1 %, 1.25 % 
and 1.5 %. The spraying was conducted at an air tem perature of 24 oC with a 
compressed air temperature of 20 oC. 
 
4.1.3 Results 
Comparison of Two Gelling Agents Adhesion 
The initial percentage cover of agar on the interme diate PVC plates was over  
50 % greater than the initial percentage cover of a lginate on the plates (Figure 10). The Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 76  agar percentage cover was significantly higher than  the alginate cover (t (df 19) =2.09, 
p<0.05) and in turn produced a significantly higher  algal density adhered to the plates 
directly after application (t (df 19) =2.09, p<0.05). The decrease in cover of the agar a nd 
alginate gelling agents over the 6 d trial without abalone present was approximately  
15 % and 12 %, respectively. This decrease recorded  in the cover of both gelling agents 
was positively correlated (R=0.902, p<0.05), with F igure 10 showing the mixtures 
deteriorated at a similar rate over time. Consequen tly, the percentage cover of agar was 
significantly higher than the percentage cover of a lginate throughout the 6 d trial  
(F (df 1,5) =3760, p<0.05). Given agar’s greater adhesion prope rties, it was utilised as the 
preferred gelling agent to establish commercial app lication protocols to adhere 
fragments of red macroalgae to the PVC settlement p lates in the abalone nursery 
system.

 77  Development of an Agar Adhesion Protocol 
Application by Dipping 
The agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment mixture was easily applied to the 
intermediate PVC plates by manual dipping, however the mixture tended to clump and 
did not spread evenly across the plates. The uneven  horizontal coverage also showed 
considerable variation in the thickness of the mixt ure and contributed to its rapid 
removal (Table 9), whereby large sections “peeled” off the plates (Figure 11). Grazing 
by abalone on the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture only marginally increased the rate of 
removal (Table 9), but importantly the mixture was still consumed and produced an 
abalone growth rate of 25.96 ± 4.15 µm.day -1. There were significant, positive 
correlations between the treatments with abalone an d without abalone (control) for the 
removal of both agar (R=0.999, p<0.05) and algae (R =0.986, p<0.05) from the plates. 
This may suggest that the presence of abalone had o nly a minor effect on the 
deterioration of the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture, which could also be implied by the 
removal of the G. flagelliformis  fragments significant, positive correlation with t he 
removal of agar regardless of the treatment (contro l (R=0.982, p<0.05) and abalone 
(R=0.999, p<0.05)).

plates (20 x 15 cm) by the dipping application. The  circles identify areas of the plate 
where the mixture has “peeled off”. 
 
Application by Spraying 
The agar concentration in the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture used in the dipping 
application (1 %) was maintained, but the ratio of agar to algae was altered to 2:1 in an 
attempt to improve adhesion of the mixture. This mi xture solidified inside the chamber 
of the 3.5 mm pot spray gun and application was not  possible (Table 10). Therefore, by 
reducing the mixtures agar concentration to 0.5 % a nd 0.75 %, it allowed the mixtures 
to be sprayed onto the plates (Table 10). As the mi xture of agar and G. flagelliformis  
fragments (2:1 ratio) with an agar concentration of  0.75 % could be sprayed, it was to be 
used in an abalone feeding trial in the glass aquar ium system. However, after spraying 
half of the 120 intermediate PVC plates the mixture  began to solidify in the 3.5 mm pot 
spray gun as the ambient temperature decreased. The refore, the abalone feeding trial 
was not conducted, as the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture could not be adhered to the 
required number of plates. 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 79  To overcome the mixture solidification in the 3.5 m m pot spray gun, three 
concentrations of pure agar solution (0.5, 0.75 and  1 %) were sprayed at two air 
temperatures (23 and 28 oC), resulting in all three-agar solutions able to b e sprayed 
(Table 11). Three agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixtures (2:1 ratio) with agar concentrations of 
0.5 %, 0.75 % and 1 % were also sprayed, however th e 0.75 % and 1 % solidified at the 
ambient (23 oC) temperature (Table 11). As the concentration of agar within the  
agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture increased, the air temperature coming out of the 
compressor only had to decrease to around 20 – 21 oC to cause solidification. 
 
Maintaining an air temperature of 28 oC around the compressor was difficult, 
when using the 3.5 mm pot spray gun to spray mixtur es at higher agar concentrations 
without solidification of the mixture occurring. Th erefore, a 5 mm undercoat spray gun 
was tested as an alternative application device to reduce blockages while spraying. The 
larger diameter nozzle on the 5 mm undercoat spray gun also allowed larger macroalgal 
fragments to be sprayed, as evident when comparing the fragments in Figure 12 a and b. 
Three agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment mixtures (2:1 ratio) with agar concentrat ions of  
1 %, 1.25 % and 1.5 % were successfully sprayed usi ng the 5 mm undercoat spray gun 
at 24 oC ambient temperature (20 oC air compressor temperature) (Table 12). However, 
the agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture with a 1.5 % agar concentration did result  in a few 
blockages that could be removed, but slowed the spr aying process considerably.

 82  4.1.4 Discussion 
Agar was shown to be the most appropriate gelling a gent compared to a calcium 
alginate gel matrix for adhering a test algal cultu re to artificial substrata. There was over 
50 % greater cover of agar than alginate on the int ermediate PVC plates at application 
and this was maintained over a 6 d period. The grea ter agar cover meant that 
approximately 3 times the amount of algal biomass c ould be adhered to the plates 
during application. The agar/algae mixture was also  considerably easier to apply to the 
PVC plates, as the application process only require d one solution to be prepared and 
once this agar solution had cooled, the algal cultu re could be added and the resultant 
mixture applied directly to the plates. The origina l application process for the 
alginate/algae mixture was to combine the sodium al ginate solution with the algal 
suspension then spray or brush this onto the plates . The plates were to then be dipped in 
the calcium chloride solution to form the insoluble  calcium alginate gel matrix, which 
would adhere the algal culture to the plates (Stott  et al.  2002, 2003a, 2003b). This 
method proved difficult as the sodium alginate and algal mixture (3 % alginate) “ran 
off” the plates and could not be exposed to the cal cium chloride solution. To overcome 
this “run off” the method utilised in the Compariso n of Two Gelling Agents Adhesion 
experiment (Section 4.1.2), of pre-soaking the PVC plates in the CaCl 2 solution before 
spraying the sodium alginate/algae mixture onto the  plates, allowed the alginate/algae 
mixture to bond with the CaCl 2 solution, adhering the algae onto the plates. Stot t et al.  
(2002) found that a 2 % sodium alginate/artificial diet mixture painted onto corrugated 
plates and dipped into a 5 % calcium chloride solut ion maintained adhesion for 2 d in 
seawater. The viscosity produced by the artificial diet combined with sodium alginate 
may have reduced the “run off” before the plates we re dipped into the calcium chloride, 
when compared to the highly fluid sodium alginate/a lgae mixture used in this particular 
experiment. However, one of the main limitations fo r the use of calcium alginate 
matrixes has been the loss of stability in seawater  (Moreno-Garrido 2008), which would 
contribute to the short time period it can adhere a lgae to the plates when placed in 
abalone culture. The ease of application combined w ith the higher gelling agent 
percentage cover and algal abundance, indicated the  adherence of algal biomass to PVC 
plates was best achieved with agar as the gelling a gent. 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 83  Suitable artificial adhesion protocols were develop ed using the agar gelling 
agent with live macroalgal fragments; given fragmen t culture was identified as an 
appropriate propagation method for incorporating re d macroalgae into the abalone 
nursery system (Section 3.4.3). The application met hod of hand dipping the 
intermediate PVC plates into the agar/ G. flagelliformis  fragment mixture was very 
simple to use, while also easily scaled up to allow  mass application of the mixture. Due 
to the uneven cover produced, the combination of ae ration and water flow in the 
aquariums caused large sheets of the mixture to “pe el off” the plates. Abalone grazing 
did not really affect the rate of removal, as the a gar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture was 
removed too quickly for the abalone to consume the macroalgal fragments while 
attached to the plates. Importantly, the abalone di d consume the macroalgal fragments 
and agar when it was on the bottom of the tank, pro ducing a growth rate of  
25.96 µm.day -1. Research by Stott et al.  (2003b) has demonstrated that a combination of 
artificial diet and alginate binder produced signif icantly larger postlarval abalone when 
the same amount was placed on the bottom of a cultu re vessel, compared to when the 
alginate binder attached the artificial diet to pla tes. Agar by itself can be consumed by 
Haliotis midae  (4 – 6 mm shell length) when fed as a control diet  for testing artificial 
diets and produced an abalone growth rate of 7 µm.day -1, indicating agar was not 
detrimental but must have a protein source added to  produce commercially viable 
abalone growth (Ismail  et al.  2009). 
 
To reduce the amount of agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture peeling off the plates, a 
compressed air, gravity fed spray gun (3.5 mm) was used to provide a more even 
coverage. The force at which the diet was sprayed a lso helped in producing a stronger 
adherence onto the plates. Stott et al.  (2004a, 2004b, 2004d) had to regularly re-apply  
(2 d) an agar/artificial diet mixture when using a hand held fine mist sprayer, to 
maintain sufficient artificial diet biomass on the plates for postlarval abalone. This  
re-application rate would not be feasible on a larg e-scale, hence the use of the 
compressed air spray gun to cover greater surface a reas, more efficiently, while 
producing a stronger adhesion. 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 84  The agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture (2:1 ratio) with a 1 % agar concentration used 
in the dipping experiment blocked the nozzle of the  spray gun. Pure agar solution could 
be sprayed easily and the agar/algae mixture with t he lower agar concentration of  
0.75 % (2:1 ratio) could also be sprayed effectivel y. When the mixture was sprayed over 
a long period of time both the mixture and the ambi ent temperatures decreased, 
resulting in the mixture solidifying in the spray g un. Given agar is a thermo-reversible 
gel the application temperature was critical in the  adhesion protocol, as the mixture has 
to be sprayed before the agar solidifies at tempera tures of between 35 and 40 oC 
(Moreno-Garrido 2008). However, the temperature of the agar cannot be too warm, as 
the live macroalgal fragments could be damaged duri ng the short thermal shock before 
application. To compensate for this, the ambient ai r temperature was raised to produce a 
warmer air compressor temperature rather than using  agar at a higher temperature, 
which allowed an agar/ G. flagelliformis  mixture with up to a 1 % agar concentration to 
be sprayed. Maintaining an air compressor temperatu re of around 28 oC was difficult and 
furthermore, the G. flagelliformis  fragments were not regenerating in the agar, most 
likely due to the small size of the fragments (1 mm ) needed when using the 3.5 mm pot 
spray gun. To overcome both of these limitations a 5 mm undercoat (direct feed) spray 
gun was utilised. The bigger diameter nozzle allowe d larger fragments (2 – 3 mm)  
and mixtures with higher agar concentrations (1.25 %) to be sprayed at lower 
temperatures. 
 
The method for adhering red macroalgal fragments to  PVC plates with agar was 
refined from a dipping to a spraying application pr ocedure. For the spraying method, the 
agar/algae mixtures agar concentration, macroalgal fragment size and the temperature at 
which it was sprayed were critical. The final proto col required fragments of macroalgae 
to be combined with a pure agar solution of 1.875 %  at a 2:1 ratio of agar to algae, 
producing a mixture with 1.25 % agar concentration.  This agar/macroalgal fragment 
mixture could then be sprayed using a 5 mm undercoa t spray gun onto the PVC plates, 
allowing an alternative diet of high biomass red ma croalgal fragments to be trialled in 
the nursery system for juvenile greenlip abalone. 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 85  4.2 LAURENCIA  FRAGMENT / AGAR DIET FEEDING TRIAL 
4.2.1 Introduction 
Vegetative propagation by fragmentation was identif ied (Section 3.4.3) as a 
possible method for producing high red macroalgal p lantlet biomass to accommodate 
the intense grazing pressure of juvenile Haliotis laevigata  (>5 mm shell length). Due to 
the plate design of the nursery system currently us ed by Australian abalone farms, 
protocols were developed to facilitate the artifici al adhesion of red macroalgal 
fragments onto the PVC plates (Section 4.1), genera ting an alternative juvenile abalone 
diet for the later nursery phase. 
 
The use of macroalgal thalli fragments to produce p lantlets by vegetative growth 
removes the need for spore production and therefore  the variability in collection of 
fertile macroalgal material. Vegetative propagation  has been a common method of 
commercial macroalgal production and the vertical P VC nursery plates provided a 
unique substratum on which to seed the macroalgal f ragments. A protocol utilising an 
agar solution (1.875 %) combined with macroalgal fr agments at a 2:1 ratio, applied 
using a 5 mm undercoat (direct fed) compressed air spray gun, allowed thalli of adult 
red macroalgae to be seeded onto the vertical plate s on which the juvenile abalone 
reside. Small thalli fragments (2 – 3 mm) could the n attach and grow into plantlets, 
creating a 3-dimensional red macroalgal diet with g reater algal biomass than the current 
2-dimensional, commercial nursery diet consisting o f the green alga Ulvella lens  plus 
the diatom Navicula  cf. jeffreyi . 
 
In the Vegetative Fragment Experiment (Section 3.3. 3), Gracilaria  sp. and 
Hypnea  sp. were both successfully established as fragment  cultures. However, on a 
large-scale neither of these macroalgae could be pr ocessed via mechanical means into 
the small fragment size required, and therefore had  to be cut by hand, which 
significantly reduced the efficiency of producing t he diet. The increased fragment size 
of Gracilaria  and Hypnea  due to manual cutting, caused extensive problems f or the 
artificial adhesion protocol developed (Section 4.1 ), as the fragments would continually Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 86  block the 5 mm undercoat spray gun and very little agar/algae mixture could be applied 
effectively to the PVC plates. Even though both Gracilaria  and Hypnea  fragments were 
able to produce growth rates of over 0.035 µg.day -1 and survival rates greater than  
98.5 % in the Vegetative Fragment Experiment (Secti on 3.3.3), this did not translate 
into suitability for the agar artificial adherence protocols. Subsequently, these two red 
macroalgae were unable to be adhered onto the verti cal PVC plates used in the abalone 
nursery system. Neither macroalga could be harveste d in sufficient biomass near the 
abalone feeding trial location, further limiting th e ability of the algae to be utilised in the 
experimental juvenile abalone nursery diet. 
 
To integrate red macroalgae by vegetative propagati on into the current nursery 
system, Laurencia  sp. was utilised. Even though it had variable grow th rates and an 
average survival of only 53.3 % (Section 3.3.3), th e Laurencia  thallus was extremely 
suited to large-scale production of fragments. The artificial adherence protocols 
developed also suited Laurencia  thalli, just as Laurencia okamurai  has shown bud and 
callus regeneration when fragments (<5 mm) where cu ltured on solid medium with 
greater than 0.5 % agar (Robaina  et al.  1990, Shen  et al.  2010). Furthermore, Laurencia  
could also be harvested in the biomass required for  the juvenile abalone feeding trial 
from a collection site close to the trials location  (Mistaken Island, Section 2.1). To test 
the vegetative propagation method by fragmentation and the artificial adherence 
protocols developed, fragments of Laurencia  adhered to the PVC plates with agar were 
used as an alternative red macroalgal diet for juve nile abalone in the later nursery phase. 
 
Different system designs are another management str ategy currently employed 
by abalone aquaculture, where juvenile abalone are weaned early onto an artificial diet 
in a growout system. This strategy of utilising an artificial diet was compared to the 
dietary value of two nursery system diets, the frag mented red macroalga, Laurencia  
adhered (sprayed) to the vertical PVC plates with a gar, and the current commercial 
nursery ( U. lens  plus N.  jeffreyi ). All three of these diet treatments were evaluate d for 
their ability to maintain juvenile greenlip abalone  ( H. laevigata ) growth and survival 
throughout the later nursery stage. Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 87  4.2.2 Feeding Trial Experimental Design 
Location 
The juvenile abalone feeding trial was conducted at  the commercial abalone 
farm Great Southern Marine Hatcheries in Albany, We stern Australia between May and 
August 2005. Greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata ) were spawned in October 2004 and 
the juveniles grown in Great Southern Marine Hatche ries’ nursery system until required. 
 
Algal Culture – Diets 
Laurencia  sp. Fragments Adhered with Agar Diet 
Laurencia  sp. thalli were harvested from the Mistaken Island  collection site 
(Section 2.1) and placed in a conical tank with flo w through seawater under strong 
aeration, outdoors exposed to natural irradiance. T o prepare the diet, Laurencia  thalli 
were cut into 2 – 3 mm fragments using a commercial  food processor, with 1.8 kg 
blotted wet weight of thalli needed to produce 2 L of fragments (Figure 13). Agar was 
used as the adhesion substance (Section 4.1.3) and 75 g was dissolved in 4 L of 1 µm 
filtered seawater (1.875 %, ICF). Once the agar had  cooled to less than 40 oC, 2 L of 
fragmented Laurencia  was added (2:1 agar:algae) resulting in a mixture with an agar 
concentration of 1.25 %. The mixture was then spray ed onto 60 clean PVC settlement 
plates (60 x 26 cm) using the 5 mm undercoat compre ssed air spray gun (Figure 13). 
The plates were allowed to set for 1 h and then dis tributed into a nursery tank filled with 
5 µm filtered seawater (ICF) non-flow through, receivi ng no aeration for the first 24 h. 
This process was performed for the 3 replicate nurs ery tanks and the Laurencia /agar 
diet was re-applied during the trial to maintain su fficient algal biomass. The  
re-applications of the Laurencia /agar diet were performed as described above, with the 
diet sprayed onto clean PVC plates with no abalone present and then placed into the 
nursery tank, while at the same time the old plates  were removed. 
 
Commercial Nursery Diet ( Ulvella lens  plus Navicula  cf. jeffreyi ) 
The construction of the commercial nursery diet fol lowed the protocol discussed 
in the General Materials and Methods Section 2.4.4.   
Figure 13: The artificial adhesion protocol in a sc hematic diagram to demonstrate the combination of t he Laurencia  sp. fragments and agar, to

 Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 89  System Design 
The nursery and weaner systems complied with the se t up and maintenance 
outlined in General Material and Methods Section 2. 4 with some minor alterations. All 
tanks were flow-through with 5 µm filtered seawater (ICF) and 60 x 26 cm PVC plates  
used in the nursery system. Each of the 6 nursery t anks were stocked with 2400 juvenile 
greenlip abalone (8 mm shell length) averaging 40 j uveniles per plate (128 abalone.m -2), 
while each weaner tank (3 replicates) was stocked w ith 6000 juvenile abalone  
(8 mm shell length, 1910 abalone.m -2) fed the artificial diet (Section 2.4.2). The feed ing 
trial was for a period of 12 weeks with the baskets  containing the PVC plates in the 
nursery system rotated 180o about the horizontal fortnightly, and the three co mmercial 
nursery diet tanks re-inoculated with N. jeffreyi  and MAF (Section 2.2.2) added, 
weekly. 
 
Measurements 
Measurement of the feeding trial parameters followe d those outlined in General 
Material and Methods Section 2.4.5. Abalone were me asured by shell length, fortnightly 
and weight, monthly using a sub-sample of 50 juveni les per tank in the nursery system 
and 100 juveniles per tank in the weaner system. Th e Laurencia  fragments were 
counted as the number of fragments per cm 2 at the beginning and end of each 
application, while the U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  were counted fortnightly during the trial. 
 
Data Analysis 
Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance compared aba lone growth rates 
throughout the 12-week feeding trial. The abalone i nitial shell length, final shell length, 
total trial growth rate, specific growth rate, weig ht gain and survival were all examined 
by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). If signifi cant differences between diets 
were observed (p<0.05) the Tukey Post-Hoc test for multiple comparisons of means was 
applied. The variation between each application of the Laurencia /agar diet expressed by 
both the Laurencia  fragment removal and agar removal were also assess ed by analysis 
of variance (one-way ANOVA). The relationship betwe en abalone growth rates and 
survival, as well as the relationship between the d ensity of Laurencia  fragments and Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 90  agar removed from the plates were both explored thr ough a Pearson Product Moment 
Correlation analysis. 
 
4.2.3 Results 
Abalone Growth 
The juvenile H. laevigata  had an initial shell length of 8.13 ± 0.04 mm (Fig ure 
14), with no significant difference between the she ll lengths of abalone stocked onto the 
three diets (F (df 2,6) =2.14, p=0.199). The juvenile abalone increased in size on all diets as 
they actively fed, with the Laurencia /agar diet producing abalone of 11.29 ± 0.10 mm 
shell length, compared to 11.80 ± 0.20 mm for the c ommercial nursery diet and  
12.80 ± 0.05 mm for the artificial diet (Figure 14) . At the conclusion of the growth trial 
the juveniles feeding on the artificial diet were s ignificantly larger than the abalone 
consuming the Laurencia /agar diet and the commercial nursery diet (F (df 2,6) =35.327, 
p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05). 
 
Monthly growth rates (shell length) of juvenile aba lone feeding on the two algal 
nursery diets followed a similar profile, increasin g to a maximum of 51.47 µm.day -1 in 
the second month on the Laurencia /agar diet and 59.89 µm.day -1 on the commercial 
nursery diet, then decreasing during the last month  (Table 13). The abalone consuming 
the artificial diet had a significantly slower grow th rate than those on the commercial 
nursery diet for the first month of the trial. The growth rate then increased rapidly 
during the second month, resulting in a significant ly faster growth rate for the last 
month of the trial than that achieved by the abalon e on the Laurencia /agar diet and the 
commercial nursery diet (Table 13). The ability of the artificial diet to produce larger 
and faster growing abalone was also demonstrated by  the significantly faster total 
feeding trial growth rate of 57.23 ± 1.47 µm.day -1, compared to 36.68 ± 0.94 and  
42.82 ± 2.44 µm.day -1 obtained on the two nursery algal diets over the 1 2-week trial 
(Table 13). The specific growth rates for the abalo ne consuming the two nursery algal 
diets also exhibited similar profiles, with the com mercial nursery diet peaking at 0.51 % 
length.day -1 during week 8 and finishing at 0.44 % length.day -1 (Figure 15). Both the 
maximum and final specific growth rates of the abal one on the commercial nursery diet Chapter 4 – Macroalga1 Fragment Diet 
 91  were only slightly higher than those on the Laurencia /agar diet. The artificial diet 
initially produced a lower specific growth rate tha n the nursery algal diets, but by the 
end of the trial the abalone specific growth rate w as significantly faster than on both the 
Laurencia /agar diet and the commercial nursery diet (F (df 2,6) =29.762, p<0.05 (Tukey, 
p<0.05)) (Figure 15). 
 
The average daily weight gain per individual abalon e feeding on the artificial 
diet was nearly 2 times that of the abalone on the commercial nursery diet and 
approximately 2.5 times greater than the abalone on  the Laurencia /agar diet (Table 14). 
Subsequently, the abalone weight gain on the artifi cial diet was significantly greater 
than on both the commercial nursery and Laurencia /agar diets. The commercial nursery 
diet was also able to produce significantly greater  weight gain in juvenile abalone than 
the Laurencia /agar diet (Table 14).

 94  Abalone Survival 
The juvenile abalone had a survival of 77.5 % on th e commercial nursery diet, 
while the survival on the artificial diet was appro ximately 4 % lower and the survival of 
abalone on the Laurencia /agar diet was 6.5 % lower again (Table 14). Even t hough the 
survival of juvenile abalone on the Laurencia /agar diet was lower than the survival on 
the other two diets, it was not significantly diffe rent. The change in survival of abalone 
during the trial was significantly, negatively corr elated with the monthly abalone growth 
rate, particularly for the abalone feeding on the a rtificial diet (R=-0.99, p<0.05) and to a 
lesser extent the abalone on the commercial nursery  diet (R=-0.65, p<0.05) and the 
Laurencia /agar diet (R=-0.62, p<0.05). 
 
Algal Consumption 
The density of Laurencia  fragments removed was positively correlated with t he 
percentage cover of agar removed throughout the fee ding trial (R=0.92, p<0.05). At the 
beginning of the trial the diet “peeled” of the pla tes due to problems with adhesion 
rather than the abalone grazing pressure, and there fore regular re-application was 
required. The dramatic decrease in the amount of ag ar removed after the 3 rd  application 
was evident by the significant difference between t he first 3 applications and all the 
remaining applications apart from the 6 th  application (Figure 16). This decrease in 
removal was associated with the agar no longer “pee ling” off the plates but staying 
attached for the required application period and co nsequently, allowing the Laurencia  
fragments to be consumed by juvenile abalone on the  plates (Figure 17). The change in 
adhesion at application 4 with the diet no longer “ peeling” off the plates, was attributed 
to the plates being sprayed from a greater distance , which reduced clumping and 
increased the evenness of the diets cover. Given th e variation in adhesion strength of the 
diet during the trial, the agar cover removal and c onsequently the density of Laurencia  
fragments removed were both significantly different  between individual applications 
((F (df 10,22) =15.55, p<0.05) and (F (df 10,22) =25.451, p<0.05)) (Figure 16). Even after the 
improved adherence from the 4 th  application on, the resistance to grazing of the 
Laurencia /agar diet was still low, so regular applications w ere required to maintain 
sufficient algal biomass. Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet

Juvenile abalone actively grazed on the U. lens , as evident by the grazing tracks 
through the alga cover on the settlement plate in F igure 18. The percentage cover of  
U. lens  decreased by over 25 % during week 2 to 4 and then  by 17 % between week 6 to 
8 (Figure 19), indicating substantial juvenile abal one grazing pressure. The time periods 
following these decreases had reduced rates of decl ine and between week 4 and 6 there 
was actually a slight increase in U. lens  cover. During these two periods U. lens  spore 
release events occurred, which was demonstrated in Figure 20 at week 6 of the trial by 
the “negative” consumption rate, due to the rate of  U. lens  production being greater than 
it’s consumption by abalone resulting in an increas e in U. lens  biomass. Overall the 
commercial nursery diet had approximately 70 % of t he U. lens  cover grazed by the 
juvenile abalone during the 12-week feeding trial, even though two spore release events 
occurred. Navicula cf.  jeffreyi  density showed a regular decrease over the 12 week s and 
was reduced to less than 20 x10 4 diatom.cm -2 by the end of the trial, which was only  
15 % of the starting density (Figure 21). After wee k 2 the consumption rate of  
N. jeffreyi  fluctuated between 80 and 145 x10 3 diatom.abalone -1.day -1, indicating that 
even with a steady decline in overall density the c onsumption rate of diatoms by 
juvenile H. laevigata  can still vary (Figure 22).

4.2.4 Discussion 
The growth in shell length and survival of juvenile  H. laevigata  on the 
experimental macroalgal diet of Laurencia  fragments adhered to PVC plates using agar, 
was comparable to the current commercial nursery di et consisting of U. lens  and  
N. jeffreyi . The abalone feeding on the Laurencia /agar diet had similar, but slightly 
slower growth rate and specific growth rate profile s throughout the trial. This resulted in 
slightly smaller abalone (0.5 mm shell length diffe rence) at the end of the 12-week trial, 
but there was no significant difference between the  two nursery diets for growth 
parameters based on shell length. Both diets exhibi ted a decrease in growth rates and 
specific growth rates after week 8 of the trial. Th is could indicate that, at an appropriate 
abalone stocking density ( ≈128 abalone.m -2), neither of the nursery algal diets can 
supply sufficient biomass to sustain adequate abalo ne growth once the juveniles reach 
over 10 mm shell length. 
 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 100  The commercial nursery diet was able to produce sig nificantly greater abalone 
weight gain (1.62 µg.day -1) than the Laurencia /agar diet (1.19 µg.day -1). The greater 
abalone weight gain combined with a 10 % higher sur vival rate on the commercial 
nursery diet compared to the Laurencia /agar diet has implications regarding the biomass 
of juvenile abalone able to be produced in the nurs ery system. These implications will 
subsequently affect the abalone biomass harvested a nd weaned onto artificial diets in 
the growout system and therefore, the carrying capa city and overall production of the 
abalone farm. 
 
Harvesting abalone that are greater than 8 mm shell  length from the nursery 
system and weaning them onto artificial diets in a growout system, could be an 
appropriate strategy to improve growth in juvenile greenlip abalone. The artificial diet 
utilised in the weaner system was able to produce a balone of significantly greater size, 
growth rate, specific growth rate and weight gain a t the end of the 12-week feeding trial, 
compared to either of the algal diets in the nurser y system. The abalone growth rate on 
the artificial diet increased rapidly throughout th e trial, reaching 70.84 µm.day -1 during 
the last month. Juvenile abalone (3 to 18 mm shell length) of different species have 
regularly achieved growth rates of up to 85 µm.day -1 on various artificial diets during 
long-term feeding trials (>3 months) (Fleming  et al.  1996, Daume  et al.  2007, Dlaza  et 
al.  2008). 
 
The commercial nursery diet in this trial produced a juvenile abalone growth rate 
of 59.89 µm.day -1 at week 8, with an overall trial growth rate of 42 .82 µm.day -1. These 
growth rates are comparable to those attained in tw o feeding trials using the same 
commercial nursery diet, similar size juvenile abal one and stocking density (Daume  et 
al.  2007). However, juvenile H. laevigata  growth rates of up to 70 – 80 µm.day -1 have 
been recorded over a 16-week feeding trial (Daume &  Ryan 2004). Even though the 
maximum specific growth rate (0.51 % length.day -1 at week 8) achieved by the abalone 
consuming the commercial nursery diet in this trial  was comparable to that  
(0.48 % length.day -1) recorded by Daume et al.  (2007), the weight gained by the 
abalone in this trial was only slightly less but ac hieved in about half the time. Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 101  The juvenile abalone in this feeding trial were har vested from an U. lens  and  
N. jeffreyi  diet in the source nursery system at Great Souther n Marine Hatcheries, 
consequently producing a significantly faster growt h rate on the commercial nursery 
diet than the artificial diet during the initial st age of the trial. The first month of abalone 
growth rates were low on the Laurencia /agar diet and the artificial diet, which can be 
accounted for by a weaning period between the sourc e diet and the experimental diets 
(Fleming  et al.  1996). Taking this weaning period into account, th e Laurencia /agar diet 
was still able to produce juvenile abalone growth r ates comparable to the current 
commercial nursery diet, while the artificial diet produced significantly higher growth 
rates. 
 
The weaning period also had implications on abalone  survival between the diet 
treatments, with the survival of the abalone on the  commercial nursery diet (77.5 %) 
higher than those on the Laurencia /agar diet (67.1 %) and the artificial diet (73.6 % ). 
This relationship between survival of juvenile abal one on U. lens  diets in the nursery 
system (70 – 80 %) and artificial diets in the wean er system (60 – 70 %) has also been 
identified by other juvenile H. laevigata  (3 – 15 mm shell length) feeding trials (Daume 
& Ryan 2004, Daume  et al.  2007). The mortality for juvenile abalone fed the artificial 
diet in this trial predominately occurred in the in itial stages due to the husbandry stress 
of harvesting and weaning, which also corresponded to a period of slow growth. The 
mortality for juvenile abalone on the commercial nu rsery diet was low at the start, but as 
growth rates decreased when food became a limiting factor towards the end of the trial, 
the mortality increased. Juvenile abalone growth ra tes are negatively correlated against 
survival, with the predominate mortality periods oc curring at either end of the later 
nursery phase. 
 
The consumption of algae in the commercial nursery diet was extensive, with 
the U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  reduced to 30 % and 15 % of their original cover a nd density, 
respectively. The two U. lens  spore release events were critical in the algal co ver not 
decreasing even further during the trial. The N. jeffreyi  consumption rate was 
maintained ( ≈100 x10 3 diatom.abalone -1.day -1) throughout the entire trial and did not Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 102  decrease as the abalone grew to larger sizes, which  are not usually associated with the 
consumption of diatoms (Kawamura  et al.  1995, Kawamura 1996). Despite the U. lens  
spore release events providing additional algal cov er and the constant consumption of 
N. jeffreyi , food availability still became limited and the al gal biomass could not support 
the faster growth rates (week 8) for the duration o f the 12-week feeding trial. To 
overcome this, new seeded plates of U. lens  could be introduced to accommodate the 
intensive grazing pressure of the juvenile abalone and maintain the abalone in the 
nursery system for the entire later nursery phase ( Fleming 1995b, Daume  et al.  2004). 
 
The uniqueness of the Laurencia /agar diet makes it difficult to compare with 
other juvenile abalone nursery feeding trials. Alth ough, a procedure utilising an 
artificial diet attached to plates has been develop ed for postlarval settlement and growth 
(Stott  et al.  2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d). A study incorporating  alginate as the gelling 
agent for adhering artificial diets to plates recor ded growth rates of approximately  
25 µm.day -1 for Haliotis discus discus  postlarvae ( ≈400 µm shell length), while the 
same artificial diet and alginate gelling agent not  attached to the plates, increased the 
growth rate by a further 10 µm.day -1 (Stott  et al.  2003b). Higher postlarval growth rates 
of 40 – 50 µm.day -1 have been recorded using the agar (1 %) adhesion m ethodology 
with artificial diets as the food source (Stott  et al.  2004b, 2004d). A recent study using 
artificial diets supplemented with emulsified fish oil and adhered to plates with a 1.5 % 
solution of agar has shown Haliotis diversicolor supertexta  growth rates of over  
70 µm.day -1 are achievable in shaded conditions, while unshade d conditions produced 
abalone growth rates reaching 90 µm.day -1 (Chao  et al.  2010). All of these studies 
utilised artificial diets instead of live macroalga e, which allowed the artificial diet/agar 
mixtures to be sprayed at much higher temperatures.  This makes the application process 
significantly easier than with the Laurencia /agar diet, as the agar temperature while 
spraying can be further from its solidification poi nt. However, these artificial diet/agar 
mixtures still required re-application onto the pla tes at least every 2 to 7 d. Until the 
Chao et al.  (2010) study, all of the abalone growth rates reco ded were similar to that 
attained on the Laurencia /agar diet. Substantial points of difference occur between all of 
those studies and this feeding trial, as the growth  rates recorded were for postlarval Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 103  abalone consuming artificial diets and not the cons umption of a macroalgal fragment 
diet by juvenile abalone greater than 8 mm shell le ngth. 
 
The removal of the juvenile abalone feed ( Laurencia  fragments) from the plates 
positively correlated with the removal of agar. The  first few weeks saw a majority of the 
diet “peel” off the plates, but as the trial contin ued the agar removal and subsequently 
the macroalgal removal decreased dramatically. From  application 4 on, the removal of 
both agar and macroalgal fragments was a representa tion of abalone consumption rather 
than the diet “peeling” off the plates. Visible gra zing tracks through the agar and 
observations of the juveniles eating the fragments indicated the abalone were able to 
readily consume the diet. 
 
Even though the adhesion of the Laurencia /agar diet to the PVC plates improved 
after the 3 rd  application, the inability of the diet to remain o n the plates for the duration 
of the trial meant that re-application at regular i ntervals was still required. During the 
nursery feeding trial 5.4 kg of Laurencia  was used in each application to inoculate  
180 PVC settlement plates (0.03 kg.plate -1). This translated into 59.4 kg of Laurencia  
and 2.475 kg of agar costing US$195 being consumed over the entire 12-week trial. To 
use this diet on a commercial scale for the product ion of juveniles from 5 to 15 mm 
shell length, the amount of Laurencia  and agar required would be considerably greater. 
If the juvenile abalone are able to maintain the ma ximum growth rate of 51.47 µm.day -1 
over the 10 mm increase in shell length, then the n umber of Laurencia /agar applications 
(A) can be calculated by Equation 6.

where GI  was the growth interval ( µm shell length), GR  was the growth rate

 Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 104  The Laurencia /agar would need to be applied 27.6 times to produc e the 10 mm 
of shell length growth, assuming that the diet will  be re-applied on a weekly basis. If a 
commercial abalone farm can produce 500,000 juvenil e abalone to 15 mm in shell 
length while stocking at 128 abalone.m -2, the farm would require at least 35 nursery 
tanks with 360 plates per tank. If the plates are a pplied with 0.03 kg.plate -1 of 
Laurencia , then the biomass of red macroalga required by the  abalone nursery can be 
determined using Equation 7. 
 
 ( ) APl plate A ×× = Biomass  Algae  Equation 7  
where A(plate)  was the amount of algae or agar per plate (kg.plat e -1), Pl  was the 
number of plates used and A was the number of applications. 
 
Over 10 t of Laurencia  thalli would have to be cultured or harvested to p roduce 
the 10 mm of juvenile abalone shell length growth i n the commercial farm. To adhere 
the 10.43 t of macroalgae over the 6 months, 435 kg  of agar would be required at a cost 
of US$34,269 (Equation 7). This biomass of algae, q uantity of agar and cost associated; 
would be completely unattainable and uneconomical f or a commercial abalone farm 
given the juvenile abalone growth and survival reco rded consuming the Laurencia /agar 
diet. 
 
These preliminary calculations do not even factor i n the substantial labour time 
and associated expenses required in creating the Laurencia /agar diet. The 
Laurencia /agar diet took a considerable amount of time (8 h. application -1) to produce, 
given the fragments had to be adhered to the PVC pl ates. The commercial nursery diet 
was a fairly self-sufficient natural diet, as the r elease of U. lens  spores can be induced 
regularly via temperature, light and nutrient enhan cement (Takahashi & Koganezawa 
1988), therefore only routine maintenance during th e nursery phase was required 
(Section 2.4.2). The juvenile abalone weaned onto a n artificial diet had different time 
allocations and costs associated. Labour requiremen ts for the growout system can be Chapter 4 – Macroalgal Fragment Diet 
 105  highly variable and depend on growth rates, stockin g densities, feeding rate and weather 
season. 
 
Even though the Laurencia /agar diet was able to produce comparable shell 
length growth to the current commercial nursery die t, the regular re-application makes 
this diet extremely costly and labour-intensive, th erefore commercially unviable. If the 
protocols developed to adhere macroalgal fragments onto the plates (Section 4.1.3) 
could be refined to utilise the successful fragment  cultures of Gracilaria  and Hypnea  
(Section 3.3.3), the regeneration of macroalgal fra gments to plantlets on the plates could 
be achieved. This would reduce the need for re-appl ication, as the initial application 
could be sufficient to create a lasting diet for ju venile abalone. However, given the scale 
of a commercial abalone farm and expertise required  to construct the diet; the labour, 
algal biomass and material costs may not reduce suf ficiently, for macroalgal fragment 
cultures to be used as an alternative algal diet fo r juvenile abalone during the later 
nursery phase. 
 
Given the faster growth rates (shell length) and su bstantial weight gain of 
abalone feeding on the artificial diet in a weaner system, compared to both algal diets in 
the nursery system, it can be regarded as an import ant management strategy to rear 
juvenile greenlip abalone of over 8 – 10 mm shell l ength. Even though the 
Laurencia /agar diet was able to produce comparable juvenile abalone growth (shell 
length) and survival to the current commercial nurs ery diet, it would be an 
uneconomical diet to use in a commercial abalone fa rm. The inability of the artificial 
adhesion protocol to maintain algal cover on the PV C plates for extended periods of 
time, means the use of red macroalgal fragments to overcome the intense grazing 
pressure of juvenile abalone was extremely limited.  Therefore, alternative algal diets 
will not be feasible if artificial adhesion protoco ls are required to seed the plates 
currently used in Australian abalone nurseries. 
 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 106  CHAPTER 5 
MACROALGAL SPORELINGS AS A DIET FOR JUVENILE 
GREENLIP ABALONE 
Providing adequate algal diets to support the subst antial grazing pressure and 
nutritional requirements of juvenile abalone greate r than 5 mm shell length has become 
a major bottleneck in the intensification of abalon e nurseries (e.g. Krsinich  et al.  2000, 
Daume 2006). The transition of juvenile abalone (5 – 15 mm shell length) feeding on 
natural algal diets in the nursery system onto arti ficial diets in the growout (weaner) 
system, results in highly variable outcomes with re spect to growth and mortality of 
abalone (Daume 2003). To overcome this, macroalgal sporelings have been identified as 
a potential alternative algal diet to maintain abal one in the nursery system throughout 
the later phase of juvenile production. 
 
Sporelings can supply a large biomass of a variety of suitable macroalgal species 
to juvenile abalone by harnessing the algal recruit ment processes through spore 
propagation. Large spore releases can occur from fe rtile thalli and after the algal spores 
settle out of the water column, they can attach to substrata (PVC plates) and germinate, 
creating sporelings. This natural propagation proce ss would allow macroalgae to be 
utilised in the nursery system without any physical  intervention. Subsequently, there 
would be no need for the time consuming and expensi ve artificial adhesion protocols 
utilised for macroalgal fragments, as in the Laurencia  Fragment/Agar Diet Feeding 
Trial (Section 4.2). Juvenile macroalgae (sporeling s) have the potential to provide a 
much greater algal biomass per plate due to their 3 -dimensional morphology, compared 
to the 2-dimensional encrusting green alga Ulvella lens  and the diatom Navicula  cf. 
jeffreyi  currently used in commercial nurseries. This 3-dim ensional growth reduces the 
settlement plate surface area required and has the potential to provide the juvenile 
abalone with sufficient algal biomass at a time whe n they can consume 10 – 30 % of 
their body weight in algae each day (Hahn 1989b). B y utilising spore production a Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 107  relatively cost effective, high algal biomass diet can be developed for juvenile abalone 
in the nursery system. 
 
In natural algal communities, herbivores appear to be a major source of 
mortality for early post settlement stages (sporeli ngs) of macroalgae and can have a 
significant affect on the recruitment of macroalgal  species (Vadas  et al.  1992). This 
could be because juvenile macroalgae have different  structural and nutritional properties 
to adult macroalgal thalli of the same species (Van  Alstyne  et al.  1999). Juvenile 
macroalgae structural properties are smaller, thinn er and more delicate (Van Alstyne  et 
al.  2001), making them at greater risk to grazing by j uvenile abalone with small feeding 
apparatus, than the more robust, larger adult macro algal thalli. Macroalgal sporelings 
may also contain more nutrients (i.e. proteins, lip ids and carbohydrates) on a weight or 
volume basis, however; an increase in nitrogen conc entration does not necessarily 
determine herbivorous predators food choice between  juvenile and adult macroalgae 
(Van Alstyne  et al.  2001). These properties indicate that juvenile mac roalgae could be a 
key food source for herbivores and consequently, ma croalgal sporelings are considered 
important to meet the nutritional requirements of j uvenile abalone as they transition 
from a diatom-based diet to a macroalgae-based diet  at approximately 5 – 10 mm shell 
length (Kawamura  et al.  1998b, Takami & Kawamura 2003). 
 
This chapter describes the results of two large-sca le juvenile greenlip abalone 
(Haliotis laevigata ) feeding trials utilising macroalgal sporelings. T he first trial 
compares sporelings of Ulva  spp. against the current commercial diet of U. lens  plus the 
diatom N.  jeffreyi  (Section 5.1). The second trial compares two abalo ne rearing system 
designs, nursery and weaner, while also examining f ive different diets including;

 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 108  5.1 ULVA  SPORELING DIET FEEDING TRIAL 
5.1.1 Introduction 
The green alga Ulva  may be one such macroalgae that could produce spor elings 
in sufficient biomass to accommodate the grazing pr essure of juvenile greenlip abalone. 
Ulva  has an isomorphic, haplodiplontic life cycle and t he adult thallium can reproduce 
both sexually and asexually, reducing the importanc e of fertilisation in propagation 
(Hoxmark 1975). The spore producing parts of the pl ant are not limited to specific 
reproductive structures and any blade cell can expe l spores, resulting in a large spore 
production capacity (Stratmann  et al.  1996, Hiraoka  et al.  2003). The relatively simple 
means to induce large spore release events through a variety of physical changes, are 
another advantage for utilising Ulva  in commercial cultivation (Nordby 1977, Han  et al.  
2003, Mantri  et al.  2011). 
 
The combination of these factors has led to the dev elopment of Ulva  sporelings 
as a diet for juvenile abalone. A small-scale pilot  study using Ulva  sporelings was able 
to produce abalone growth rates of approximately 33  µm.day -1 (Strain 2003). Given the 
reproductive processes of Ulva  can be conducive to easy culture and juvenile abal one 
actively feed on the sporelings, Ulva  sporelings were considered as an alternative diet 
for juvenile abalone in the later nursery phase. Th e preliminary sporeling diet was 
subsequently converted from small, horizontal plate s into a fully working diet for the 
vertical settlement plates in the nursery system. T he protocols developed during this 
Ulva  sporeling feeding trial have since been utilised t o test different rearing systems for 
juvenile greenlip abalone (Daume  et al.  2007). 
 
A large-scale feeding trial was conducted to determ ine if the experimental 
sporeling diet could accommodate the high grazing p ressure of juvenile greenlip 
abalone through the entire (5 – 15 mm shell length)  later nursery phase. The Ulva  
sporeling diet was compared to the current commerci al nursery diet consisting of the 
green alga U. lens  plus the diatom N. jeffreyi  on the growth and survival of juvenile  
H. laevigata . Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 109  5.1.2 Feeding Trial Experimental Design 
Location 
The juvenile abalone feeding trial was conducted in  a greenhouse at the 
Aquaculture Development Unit, Challenger TAFE in Fr emantle, Western Australia 
between March and August 2004. Greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata ) were spawned 
in December 2003 and the juveniles produced by Grea t Southern Marine Hatcheries in 
Albany, Western Australia. 
 
Algal Culture – Diets 
Ulva  spp. Sporeling Diet 
Ulva  spp. thalli were harvested from the South Mole col lection site (Section 2.1) 
and exposed to a temperature and dark treatment to induce gametogenesis (Strain 2003). 
The Ulva  thalli were arranged in layers between moist newsp apers on trays and then 
refrigerated at 4 oC in complete darkness for 24 h. After a 7 d treatm ent, 10 kg blotted 
wet weight of Ulva  thalli were placed into each of the five, 400 L nu rsery tanks filled 
with f/2 culture medium modified by removing the PI I metals, sodium metasilicate and 
vitamin stock solutions (Section 2.2, 1 µm filtered, ICF). Each tank held three baskets 
of twelve, 60 x 30 cm PVC settlement plates orienta ted horizontally. Only light aeration 
of the non-flow through seawater was used within th e tanks to reduce water motion and 
allow maximum spore attachment. 
 
After 6 d the Ulva  thalli were removed from the tanks and the sporeli ng seeded 
PVC plates redistributed into three, 400 L nursery tanks each containing three baskets of 
20 plates, now orientated vertically. The sporeling s were then cultured over 5 weeks in 
the modified f/2 medium (1 µm filtered, ICF) as described above, which was exch anged 
twice weekly. 
 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 110  Commercial Nursery Diet ( Ulvella lens  plus Navicula  cf. jeffreyi ) 
The commercial nursery diet of U. lens  and N.  jeffreyi  followed the protocol 
discussed in General Materials and Methods Section 2.4.4 with some minor 
adjustments. The U. lens  seed plates were left exposed to sunlight for 5 d to induce the 
release of spores and the same modified f/2 medium (1 µm filtered, ICF) used for the 
Ulva  sporeling diet was exchanged twice weekly. The dia tom N. jeffreyi  was cultured in 
4 Petri dishes rather than the small bags (200 mL) and no large bags were used, instead 
the cultures went from 4 medium bags to a Mexican h at tank. 
 
System Design 
The nursery system was as outlined in the General M aterial and Methods 
Section 2.4.1 with the system maintenance described  in Section 2.4.2. However,  
1700 juvenile abalone of 3.5 to 4 mm shell length w ere stocked in each of the six tanks, 
giving approximately 28 juveniles per 60 x 30 cm pl ate (79 abalone.m -2). The feeding 
trial was for a period of 14 weeks and the three U. lens  tanks were re-inoculated with  
N. jeffreyi  during week 2, 4 and 8, while the plates in all ta nks were rotated 180 o about 
the horizontal in week 3 and 10. The water temperat ure over the trial started at  
20.8 ± 0.13 oC (May), then reduced to 19.7 ± 0.18 oC (June) and finished at 19 ± 0.08 oC 
(July). 
 
Measurements 
Measurement of the feeding trial parameters followe d those outlined in General 
Material and Methods Section 2.4.5. A sub sample of  50 juvenile abalone from  
10 randomly selected settlement plates in each tank , were measured weekly for shell 
length (mm). Ulva  sporeling abundance was determined by counting the  number of 
sporeling blades per cm 2 on the settlement plates and the density of N. jeffreyi  was 
measured on 2 removable 16 cm 2 sample plates, positioned 3 cm from the top and 
bottom of 9 settlement plates in each tank. Both al gal diets were measured at weekly 
intervals during the feeding trial. 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 111  Biochemical Analysis 
The biochemical analysis of the Ulva  sporeling and commercial nursery diets 
was detailed in General Material and Methods Sectio n 2.3. Samples were taken by 
scraping diagonally across the settlement plates th at were used for determining weekly 
algal abundance. Five millilitre of the commercial nursery diet samples were required 
for each of the dry weight, lipid, protein and carb ohydrate analyses. The amount of Ulva  
sporeling diet sample required for each analysis wa s, 0.05 g for dry weight, 0.025 g for 
lipid, 0.0125 g for protein and 0.012 g for carbohy drate. 
 
Data Analysis 
Juvenile abalone growth and density for the two die tary treatments, Ulva  
sporeling and commercial nursery were compared by a nalysis of variance (one-way 
ANOVA). A Univariate Analysis of Variance (Tukey Po st-Hoc) was applied to test for 
differences between mean weekly abalone sizes (shel l length) on the two diets. 
Comparison of the algal species consumption was ach ieved through Bivariate 
Correlation, while analysis of variance (one-way AN OVA) was used for examining the 
biochemical composition. An Independent t-test was utilised to compare the diatom 
consumption at the top and bottom of the settlement  plates during the plate rotation 
(180 o about the horizontal) sequence. 
 
5.1.3 Results 
Abalone Growth 
At the commencement of the feeding trial there was no significant difference 
between the average shell lengths of the abalone st ocked on the Ulva  sporeling diet and 
the commercial nursery diet (F (df 1,4) =0.317, p=0.604). The juvenile abalone grew on 
both diets with the Ulva  sporeling diet producing significantly larger abal one (shell 
length) throughout the first 5 weeks (F (df 1,28) =6.779, p<0.05). During the first 4 weeks 
the mean weekly increase in shell length of the aba lone on the Ulva  sporeling diet was 
0.51 ± 0.1 mm, with each increase shown to be signi ficant (Table 15). The abalone on 
the commercial nursery diet only averaged a weekly increase in shell length of  Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 112  0.41 ± 0.1 mm for the 4 weeks, but were able to mai ntain significant increases in shell 
length until week 7 (Table 15). This extended perio d of significantly greater growth 
resulted in the abalone on the commercial nursery d iet surpassing the size (shell length) 
of the abalone on the Ulva  sporeling diet. This transition can be seen in Fig ure 23 where 
the two growth profiles intersect between week 5 an d 6. The commercial nursery diet 
then proceeded to yield significantly larger abalon e (shell length) from week 6 to the 
end of the feeding trial (F (df 1,46) =24.671, p<0.05). 
 
The growth rates of juvenile abalone were fastest ( reaching nearly 100 µm.day -1) 
on both the Ulva  sporeling diet and the commercial nursery diet dur ing week 3 to 6 of 
the trial (Table 16). The abalone growth rates for the first 2 weeks of the feeding trail 
have been excluded to account for a weaning period.  The Ulva  sporeling diet achieved a 
greater abalone specific growth rate during the ini tial stages of the trial, reaching a 
maximum of 1.5 % length.day -1 at week 4 (Figure 24). After week 8 of the feeding  trial 
abalone shell length was not significantly differen t between adjacent weeks on either 
diet, apart from week 10 for the abalone on the com mercial nursery diet (Table 15), 
which produced a reduction in growth rate (Table 16 ) and specific growth rate (Figure 
24). From Table 16 it was evident that the Ulva  sporeling diet resulted in slightly slower 
growth rates during the entire feeding trial (F (df 1,82) =0.583, p=0.448). Subsequently, the 
specific growth rate of the juvenile abalone throug hout the 14-week trial was not 
significantly affected by diet (F (df 1,82) =1.968, p=0.164), with both diets producing 
abalone specific growth rates of approximately 1 % length.day -1 by the end of the trial 
(Figure 24). The juveniles consuming the Ulva  sporeling diet were smaller in shell 
length at the completion of the trial with an avera ge of 9.61 ± 0.1 mm, compared to the 
10.29 ± 0.1 mm the abalone on the commercial nurser y diet achieved (Figure 23). The 
final abalone shell lengths were significantly diff erent, indicating that the commercial 
nursery diet produced significantly larger abalone over the 14-week feeding trial  
(F (df 1,4) =8.218, p<0.05).

Abalone Survival 
In conjunction with growth, mortality and subsequen tly abalone density are 
important in comparing the two diets’ effectiveness  as a nutrition source for juvenile 
abalone. Weekly mortality on both diets exhibited s imilar profiles with the commercial 
nursery diet producing an average of 91 mortalities  in week 3, but thereafter the Ulva  
sporeling diet recorded slightly higher mortalities  until week 10 (Table 17). Calculating 
the progressive abalone density from the weekly mor tality, it was found that there was 
no significant difference in abalone density betwee n the two diets (F (df 1,82) =0.569, 
p=0.453). Even though the survival of abalone at th e end of the 14-week trial was lower 
on the Ulva  sporeling diet (38.2 %) compared to the commercial  nursery diet (46.9 %), 
the difference was not significant (F (df 1,4) =3.911, p=0.119).

Algal Consumption 
The juvenile abalone consumed entire Ulva  sporelings (i.e. both blade and 
attachment regions) as demonstrated by the sections  of cleared settlement plate in 
Figure 25. During the first month of the feeding tr ial consumption of sporelings peaked 
at 500 sporeling blade.abalone -1.day -1, but by week 6 the consumption had decreased to 
100 sporeling blade.abalone -1.day -1. Consumption gradually increased after that  
(week 6), doubling by the end of the feeding trial (Figure 26). During the last 2 months 
there was a significant, positive correlation betwe en the increase in Ulva  sporeling 
consumption and the increase in abalone shell lengt h (R=0.583, p<0.05). 
 
The consumption of U. lens  followed a similar trend and was significantly, 
positively correlated (R=0.422, p<0.05) to the Ulva  sporeling consumption, but with a 
reduced rate of decline after the initial period of  high consumption (Figure 27). 
Consumption of U. lens  also correlated significantly with the growth rate   
(R=0.544, p<0.05) and subsequently the specific gro wth rate (R=0.618, p<0.05) of the 
juvenile abalone. Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 117  Diatom consumption showed a similar profile to that  of the Ulva  sporelings and 
U. lens  consumption, including the slow increase after wee k 7 (Figure 28). However, 
the diatom consumption was “negative” or zero diato m.abalone -1.day -1 for week 7 to 12, 
because the diatoms divided (reproduced) faster tha n they were consumed by the 
abalone. Diatom consumption did not correlate with either the Ulva  sporeling or the  
U. lens  consumption, nor did it relate to abalone growth. During the feeding trial  
N. jeffreyi  was re-inoculated and the PVC plates rotated as il lustrated in Figure 28 and 
Table 18, with the consumption of diatoms correspon ding to the plate rotation rather 
than the re-inoculation. The diatom consumption by abalone on the intermediate sample 
plates at the top and bottom of the settlement plat es were statistically different  
(t (df 41) =-2.986, p<0.05), indicating that rotating the sett lement plates had a considerable 
effect on the consumption of N. jeffreyi . 
 
Two other species of diatom, Melosira  cf. moniliformis  and Synedra  sp. 
contaminated the Ulva  sporeling diet treatment at various stages (Table 18). These 
diatoms were present throughout the 14-week period,  however they only bloomed at the 
top of the plates on three separate occasions (star t, week 11 and week 13). The 
contamination was quickly removed by physical detac hment (abrasion) from the 
substratum and then siphoning the nursery tank cont ents.

Biochemical Composition of Algal Diets 
The approximate biochemical composition of the Ulva  sporeling diet and the 
commercial nursery diet has been shown in Table 19.  Even though the lipid, protein and 
carbohydrate contents were slightly higher in the Ulva  sporeling diet, these were not 
significantly different to the commercial nursery d iet biochemical composition. 
However, the Ulva  sporeling diet’s ash weight by deduction (15.64 %)  was significantly 
lower than the commercial nursery diet’s ash weight  by deduction (35.5 %) (Table 19).

 121  5.1.4 Discussion 
The alternative juvenile macroalgal diet of Ulva  sporelings was comparable to 
the current commercial nursery diet consisting of U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  for the growth 
and survival of juvenile H. laevigata . The two diets produced similar abalone growth 
rates and specific growth rates, but the commercial  nursery diet did result in 
significantly larger abalone at the completion of t he 14-week feeding trial. Juveniles 
feeding on the commercial nursery diet reached 10 m m shell length in less than  
13 weeks, whereas on the Ulva  sporeling diet the juveniles only reached 9.61 mm shell 
length at week 14. Daume & Ryan (2004) found that f or H. laevigata  of a similar initial 
size (4 mm shell length) it took less than 15 weeks  to reach 10 mm shell length on just 
U. lens  with a stocking density of approximately 50 animal s per plate. 
 
The transition at week 5, between the Ulva  sporeling diet and commercial 
nursery diet producing significant larger abalone, indicates that Ulva  sporelings were a 
better diet for H. laevigata  in the size range of 3.5 to 6.5 mm shell length. T he failure to 
sustain a growth advantage through to week 14 signi fies better performance of the 
commercial nursery diet for H. laevigata  in the size range of 6.5 to 10 mm shell length. 
The Ulva  sporeling diet can therefore, be considered an acc eptable commercial diet for 
juvenile greenlip abalone (<6.5 mm shell length) an d employed as either an alternative 
or in conjunction with the current commercial nurse ry diet. The use of Ulva  sporelings 
for smaller juvenile abalone could allow the diet t o be incorporated from the start of the 
nursery phase (settlement). Green macroalgal specie s including Ulva australis  and Ulva 
compressa  have been shown to induce good settlement rates fo r Haliotis rubra  (Huggett  
et al.  2005), while settlement and early growth of Haliotis tuberculata coccinea  can be 
possible on a combination of diatom species inocula ted with Ulva rigida  sporelings and 
U. lens  (Courtois de Vicose  et al.  2012). 
 
Growth rates of H. laevigata  fed the Ulva  sporeling diet were not significantly 
different from those produced on the commercial nur sery diet. The growth rate profile 
was similar to that obtained by Daume & Ryan (2004)  utilising U. lens , where once the 
first 2 weeks were removed the next 6 weeks gave ab alone growth rates of 84 µm.day -1 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 122  and the final 6 weeks, 63 µm.day -1. This decline in growth rate over time was also 
present, all be it at a slightly faster rate betwee n the first 2 months of a trial using 6 mm 
shell length juvenile H. laevigata  at the same stocking density, feeding on U. lens  
(Daume  et al.  2007). Haliotis varia  of 3 – 4 mm shell length have also shown a 
decreasing trend in growth rates from 88 to 25 µm.day -1 over 129 d when fed small 
pieces of Ulva lactuca  (Najmudeen & Victor 2004). 
 
The growth rates during the first 2 weeks of this t rial were excluded from the 
analysis in Table 16 as any nutrient deficiency in a diet may be masked by the ability of 
the abalone to utilise its own stores (Fleming  et al.  1996). As the juvenile abalone were 
taken off an U. lens /naturally occurring diatom diet, the weaning proce ss was 
considered minimal compared to the recommendation o f approximately 50 d (Day & 
Fleming 1992). However, it was important to run the  subsequent trial (Multi Diet and 
System Feeding Trial, Section 5.2) for as long as p ossible to detect any effects of 
nutrient limitation, and determine the capacity of an algae diet to maintain acceptable 
abalone growth throughout the later nursery phase. 
 
The Ulva  sporeling diet was able to produce abalone growth rates of nearly  
100 µm.day -1 during week 3 to 6 of the feeding trail. This was comparable to the growth 
rates of 3 – 4 mm shell length Haliotis discus discus  attained over 4 weeks on a variety 
of macroalgal species sporelings, including the bro wn algae Colpomenia sinuosa  and 
Ectocarpus siliculosus  as well as the green alga Enteromorpha  spp. (Maesako  et al.  
1984). Takami et al.  (2003) also showed that Haliotis discus hannai  of approximately 
1.8 – 2.2 mm and 2.8 – 2.9 mm shell length could re ach growth rates of  
80 and 100 µm.day -1 on juvenile sporophytes of the kelp Laminaria japonica . 
 
The juvenile abalone specific growth rates reached over 1.3 % length.day -1 and 
finished at 1 % length.day -1 on both the Ulva  sporeling and commercial nursery diets, 
with no significant difference between them. The Ulva  sporeling diet did produce a 
specific growth rate of 1.5 % length.day -1 at week 4 but then slowly declined. Other Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 123  studies have also found that Ulva  spp. can produce adequate abalone specific growth 
rates. For example, Corazani & Illanes (1998) repor ted that H. discus hannai  had a 
higher specific growth rate (0.69 % length.day -1) utilising adult U. rigida  than other 
macroalgal diets, while Haliotis rufescens  achieved the lowest specific growth rate. This 
was comparable to the 0.71 % length.day -1 achieved by H. discus hannai  on an Ulva  
diet (Uki & Watanabe 1992). Ulva lactuca  has been found to have reasonable dietary 
value for Haliotis tuberculata  (1.16 % length.day -1) but was significantly lower for  
H. discus hannai  (0.75 % length.day -1) (Mai  et al.  1996). Haliotis iris  was only able to 
achieve specific growth rates of 0.1 % length.day -1 on U. lactuca  (Stuart & Brown 
1994), while Simpson & Cook (1998) found that the s uitability of Ulva  as a feed was 
dependent on the abalone species. 
 
The nutritional quality of the Ulva  being used in the present study was not 
manipulated by nutrient enrichment using a nitrogen  source to increase the Ulva  protein 
content during the 14-week feeding trial. Enriched U. rigida  has been shown to produce 
growth rates of juvenile Haliotis roei  comparable to those achieved on the best 
performing artificial diets (Boarder & Shpigel 2001 ). Taylor & Tsvetnenko (2004) 
showed that only 15 mg N.L -1 enriched U. rigida  resulted in significantly higher 
specific growth rates than non enriched U. rigida . Shpigel et al.  (1999) reported  
growth rates of 44.47 and 121.47 µm.day -1 for H. discus hannai  and  
H. tuberculata  respectively, on a high ammonia-N enriched U. lactuca  compared with  
31.7 and 80.72 µm.day -1 on low ammonia-N enriched U. lactuca . The growth rate for 
H. tuberculata  produced on the high-ammonia-enriched U. lactuca  (Shpigel  et al.  1999) 
was the only abalone growth rate achieved on an Ulva  species in the reviewed literature, 
which exceed that obtained on the Ulva  sporeling diet in the present study. 
 
During the algal culturing process before the feedi ng trial began, the Ulva  
sporelings were grown in a modified f/2 medium cont aining only the NaNO 3, 
NaH 2PO 4.H 2O and FeCl 3.6H 2O stock components (Section 2.2.2). The elevation i n 
nutrients (most likely protein) at the start may ha ve led to the significantly larger 
abalone size during the first 5 weeks and in turn, the maximum specific growth rate of Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 124  1.5 % length.day -1 at week 4. After this point of the trial the growt h rate decreased, 
which could be related to the Ulva  sporelings no longer providing adequate nutrients to 
the juvenile abalone. By not supplying the Ulva  sporelings during the trial with 
nutrients like the modified f/2 medium used before the trial, the diet may have become 
deficient in a particular nutrient (most likely pro tein) important to abalone growth. 
Therefore, potential benefits may exist in culturin g nutrient enriched Ulva  sporelings to 
achieve the best juvenile abalone growth rates, a p rotocol that was subsequently 
integrated into the Multi Diet and System Feeding T rial (Section 5.2). 
 
The reduction in abalone weekly growth to only 0.08  mm on the Ulva  sporeling 
diet and 0.24 mm on the commercial nursery diet dur ing the last 2 weeks, may indicate 
that the two nursery diets were no longer able to s upply the juvenile abalone with the 
specific nutrients required for adequate performanc e. Haliotis rubra  has been shown to 
achieve steady growth for 100 d and then fail to gr ow further on some mono-species 
algal diets (Day & Fleming 1992). Lack of algal bio mass could also have became a 
problem towards the end of the feeding trial as the  Ulva  sporeling density and the  
U. lens  cover were reduced to 43 % and 25 % of their origi nal biomass, respectively. At 
this point of the feeding trial (week 12) when the required nutrients or algal biomass 
may have become inadequate, both diets had produced  abalone of approximately  
9.5 mm shell length and could be weaned onto artifi cial diets (Fleming  et al.  1996, 
Dunstan  et al.  2002). An alternative to weaning could be to incor porate new seeded 
plates into the system to reduce competition for fo od as well as the stress caused by 
handling (Fleming 1995b, Daume  et al.  2004). Daume et al.  (2004) utilised this 
procedure for U. lens , which enabled the high, initial growth rates of n ewly settled  
H. rubra  to be maintained for 114 d. The introduction of ne w seeded plates when the 
juvenile abalone are 9 –10 mm shell length should a llow the animals to maintain 
adequate commercial growth rates throughout the ent ire later nursery phase. 
 
To address both the nutrient limitation associated with a monospecies diet and 
the lack of biomass caused by the high grazing pres sure of 9 – 10 mm shell length 
abalone, it would be beneficial to incorporate the Ulva  sporeling diet as part of a mixed Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 125  or rotational diet. The incorporation of a second s uitable algal species may account for 
the nutrient deficiencies in the monospecies diet, while also increasing the algal biomass 
available (Day & Fleming 1992, Fleming 1995b, Simps on & Cook 1998). The plate 
design of the nursery system for feeding juvenile a balone would be well suited to diet 
rotation or a mixed diet regime, whereby plates see ded with different diets can be 
interspersed throughout the tanks. Stuart & Brown ( 1994) and Simpson & Cook (1998) 
demonstrated that Ulva  as a monospecies diet produced the slowest abalone  growth 
rates, but when presented in a rotational/mixed die t it sustained excellent growth rates. 
Dang et al.  (2011) also found that H. laevigata  fed single macroalga species  
(e.g. U. lactuca ) had the slowest growth rates when compared to com bination diets. 
 
The consumption rate of Ulva  sporelings was extremely high during the first 
month and so the abalone grew rapidly. However, onc e the consumption rate declined 
so did the growth rates. Hone (1992) showed that U. australis  was rapidly consumed by 
abalone, while Simpson & Cook (1998) found that Ulva  had the lowest consumption in 
g.abalone -1.day -1 compared with five other macroalgae and subsequent ly, produced the 
slowest growth rates for Haliotis midae . Boarder & Shpigel (2001) also reported that  
N-enriched U. rigida  had the lowest consumption rate, but was still abl e to produce 
growth rates of H. roei  comparable to those achieved on some of the best a rtificial diets. 
As mentioned before, ammonia-N enriched U. lactuca  produced the highest growth 
rates for both H. discus hannai  and H. tuberculata  but these rates were recorded while 
consuming significantly less biomass (Shpigel  et al.  1999). This indicates the rate of 
Ulva  sporeling consumption by abalone can affect the ab alone growth rate, while 
nutrient-enriched Ulva  produces faster growth rates with less biomass req uired to do so. 
 
The juvenile abalone may have had a similar prefere nce for these two species of 
green algae, given the consumption of Ulva  sporelings correlated significantly with the 
consumption of U. lens . This could be understandable given the biochemica l 
components (lipid, protein, carbohydrate) of the tw o diets were not statistically 
different. It was difficult to compare these two di ets with the approximate composition 
of algal species in other studies as they are expre ssed as ash weight by deduction and Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 126  not ash-free dry weight (Lewin & Guillard 1963). Th e algal samples were washed with 
10 mL ammonium formate solution (0.65 M) to reduce the problems associated with dry 
weight comparison. Even with this alteration, the Ulva  sporeling diet composition was 
nearly identical to that of U. rigida  when enriched from 11.4 % to 32.2 % protein by 
using high nutrient water (5 gN.m -2.day -1; 0.6 gP.m -2.day -1), which as a diet recorded a 
specific growth rate of approximately 0.14 % length .day -1 for H. roei  of 32 mm shell 
length (Boarder & Shpigel 2001). The Ulva  sporelings being 3-dimensional juvenile 
macroalgae are in a phase of high growth and may be  able to utilise the limited nutrient 
supply in the water more effectively than mature Ulva  thalli. 
 
The high abundance of the diatom N. jeffreyi  resulted in the commercial nursery 
diet having a significantly higher ash content by d eduction than the Ulva  sporeling diet. 
The biochemical composition of diatoms as a monospe cies diet (>50 % DW) has been 
shown to have considerably higher ash weights but l ower lipid, protein and 
carbohydrate components, when compared to composite  diets of diatom species mixed 
with U. rigida  sporelings and U. lens  (<40 % DW) (Courtois de Vicose  et al.  2012). 
Diatoms have high ash content because of their sili ca cell walls and due to differences 
in thickness of the silicified cell walls can vary both inter and intra-specifically (Lewin 
& Guillard 1963). Three diatom species shown to ind uce settlement (Gordon  et al.  
2004), produce good growth and survival of postlarv al H. discus hannai  ranged in ash 
content from 28.36 % to 41.56 % DW (Gordon  et al.  2006), which was similar to the 
commercial nursery diet ash content by deduction in  this trial. The biochemical 
composition of N. jeffreyi  has been shown to be 18 % lipid, 33 % protein and 4.9 % 
carbohydrate dry weight (Brown & Jeffrey 1995). How ever, biochemical composition 
can vary considerably between diatom species, even when grown in the same medium 
and harvested at the same phase of growth (Brown 19 91, Brown  et al.  1997). Therefore, 
an abalone nursery diet containing U. lens , diatoms and biofilm components could have 
even greater variation in biochemical composition. 
 
The commercial nursery diet with lower levels of li pid, protein and carbohydrate 
than the Ulva  sporeling diet produced significantly larger abalo ne at the end of the  Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 127  14-week feeding trial. This may suggest that higher  amounts of biochemical 
components do not necessarily increase growth, but rather an optimal level of these 
components may be responsible. Lipid levels of 3 – 5 % have been shown to be optimal 
for abalone, which corresponds with the commercial nursery diet while the Ulva  
sporeling diet had a greater lipid content (Uki & W atanabe 1992, Mercer  et al.  1993, 
Mai  et al.  1995b, Dunstan  et al.  2000). Higher levels of dietary lipid (>5 %) can b e 
detrimental to abalone growth and are thought to de press the digestibility of components 
such as fatty acids and amino acids (Uki & Watanabe  1992, Britz & Hecht 1997, Van 
Barneveld  et al.  1998, Bautista-Teruel  et al.  2011). Therefore, the high lipid level 
present in the Ulva  sporeling diet (7.12 %) may have inhibited the max imum potential 
growth rates achievable by abalone during the trial . 
 
The protein content of the commercial nursery (24.1 7 %) and Ulva  sporeling 
(32.3 %) diet were both slightly outside the optima l protein levels of 27 – 28 % for 
abalone, however these levels can range from 20 to 35 % depending on abalone species 
(Uki & Watanabe 1992, Mai  et al.  1995a, Bautista-Teruel & Millamena 1999, Coote  et 
al.  2000, Vandepeer & Van Barneveld 2002). Haliotis midae  and Haliotis fulgens  have 
shown increases in growth with an increase in prote in up to 47 and 44 % respectively 
(Britz 1996b, Gómez-Montes  et al.  2003), while similar levels have corresponded to 
greater shell production (wider and heavier) in juv enile H. iris  (Tung & Alfaro 2011). 
The range in crude protein requirements for abalone  reported in the literature may vary 
with a number of factors including abalone size, fe eding trial length, digestible protein 
to energy ratios, amino acid pattern, culture surro undings or the statistical analysis 
methods used (Lee 2004). However, to maximise prote in utilisation the diet should not 
only contain sufficient, readily digestible protein  but also a well-balanced mixture of 
essential and non–essential amino acids (Mai  et al.  1994, Britz & Hecht 1997, Daume  et 
al.  2003). 
 
The commercial nursery diet had a carbohydrate comp onent (35.85 %) much 
closer to the carbohydrate levels of 20 – 30 % that  are considered suitable for abalone 
growth (Mercer  et al.  1993), than the Ulva  sporeling diet (44.95 %). However, the Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 128  required carbohydrate levels can vary depending on species, for example artificial diets 
containing 40 and 47.8 % carbohydrate are recommend ed for Haliotis asinina  (Bautista-
Teruel & Millamena 1999, Thongrod  et al.  2003). Carbohydrate serves as the 
preferential energy source for abalone along with a  consistent amount of dietary protein, 
while lipids levels need to be minimised to allow d igestibility of other nutrients 
(Montaño-Vargas  et al.  2005). Overall the commercial nursery diet may hav e had a 
biochemical composition closer to the optimum requi rements for juvenile H. laevigata  
than the Ulva  sporeling diet and subsequently, produced larger a nimals at the 
conclusion of the feeding trial. 
 
The N. jeffreyi  consumption did not correlate with either of the o ther 2 algal 
species or any of the abalone growth results. Week 7 to 10 and 12 all showed “negative” 
consumption, indicating the N. jeffreyi  cells were dividing faster than the abalone could 
consume them. The consumption rate of N. jeffreyi  did not correspond with the  
re-inoculation, but rather the rotation of the sett lement plate’s 180 o about the horizontal. 
There are two reasons for this; firstly the light g radient through the tanks allowed  
N. jeffreyi  situated at the top of the plates to receive more light, consequently dividing 
faster and secondly, changes in grazing pressure du e to the light sensitivity/migration of 
abalone. These hypotheses were supported by visual observation during the trial as 
diatom counts increased on the sample plates at the  top and juvenile abalone where 
found on the bottom of the tanks during the day. Da ume et al.  (2004) also indicated that 
the light intensity tended to be higher at the top of plates and migration to the bottom of 
the tank by abalone was evident, while positive rel ationships between feed intake and 
the duration of darkness have also been shown (Dixo n 1992). Settlement plate rotation 
allowed the high densities of diatoms to be closer to the abalone, reducing the effort 
expended by abalone to graze. When the plates were rotated at week 3 the high  
N. jeffreyi  densities at the top were transferred to the botto m of the tank. This caused the 
high diatom densities to be closer to the majority of abalone and subsequently a spike in 
consumption occurred. Navicula cf.  jeffreyi  consumption then dropped as the density at 
the bottom declined, while the density increased at  the top due to greater light intensity 
and less grazing pressure. At week 7 the consumptio n of N. jeffreyi  became “negative” 
because the growth at the top exceeded consumption at the bottom of the plates. Once 
the second rotation at week 10 was performed the co nsumption began to increase again Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 129  as the high N. jeffreyi  density was available to the juvenile abalone at t he bottom of the 
tank. Given the benefits of rotating the diatom-cul tured plates to maintain high diatom 
densities close to where the majority of juvenile a balone reside, this practice was 
integrated into subsequent juvenile abalone feeding  trials. 
 
The contaminating diatom species only occurred in t he Ulva  sporeling diet tanks 
and were present from the creation of the diet. It was not determined if the juvenile 
abalone utilised these contaminating diatoms as a f ood source, although Synedra  was 
probably of a suitable size. It would have been dif ficult for the juveniles to deal with the 
M. moniliformis , because along with its large cell size it formed into dense mats with 
chains exceeding 5 cm in length. The large blooms o f M. moniliformis  that occurred at 
week 11 and 13 may have had some impact on the decl ining abalone growth rates, as 
juvenile abalone are susceptible to smothering and entanglement (Daume  et al.  2004). 
 
The cooling in seawater temperatures from 20.8 oC to 19 oC during the trial 
correlated with the decrease in abalone growth rate  on both diets. The colder water 
temperatures may have resulted in reduced metabolic  activity of the juvenile abalone, 
contributing to slower growth rates. Daume et al.  (2007) also found that growth rates 
correlated with mean seawater temperatures, with ju venile H. laevigata  (6 mm shell 
length) growth rates highest at the start of a feed ing trial when seawater temperature 
averaged 20.1 oC, then decreased after the first month coinciding with a decline in 
seawater temperature. 
 
Overall, Ulva  sporelings are a suitable diet for juvenile H. laevigata  as they 
produced comparable growth rates and specific growt h rates to the commercial nursery 
diet of U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  currently used in Australian abalone aquaculture. 
However, the diet was not able to overcome the subs tantial grazing pressure of juvenile 
abalone in the later nursery phase and further inve stigations into the theoretical and 
procedural principles behind the development of the  Ulva  sporeling diet are required. 
By utilising Ulva  sporelings in a mixed sporeling diet the nutrient limitation associated Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 130  with monospecies diets may be avoided. Incorporatin g new seeded plates into the 
nursery system could be a protocol to combat the gr azing pressure of abalone greater 
than 5 mm shell length and allow the juvenile green lip abalone to remain in the nursery 
system past the 9 – 10 mm shell length achieved in this trial. 
 
5.2 MULTI DIET AND SYSTEM FEEDING TRIAL 
5.2.1 Introduction 
The use of macroalgal sporelings ( Ulva  sporelings) as a diet has already 
demonstrated the ability to produce juvenile abalon e growth rates of nearly  
100 µm.day -1 and was considered comparable to the current comme rcial nursery diet of 
U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  (Section 5.1.3). However, the diet was unable to m aintain 
commercially viable juvenile abalone growth rates i n the nursery system for animals 
greater than 9 – 10 mm shell length. A combination of nutrient limitation due to the 
monospecies nature of the diet and an inability to support the substantial algal biomass 
requirements of juvenile abalone greater than 5 mm shell length restricted the 
effectiveness of the diet. 
 
To maintain juvenile abalone throughout the entire later nursery phase  
(5 – 15 mm shell length) a mixed sporeling diet of Ulva  and other macroalgal species 
was identified, along with the incorporation of new  seeded plates as algal biomass 
becomes inadequate (Section 5.14). A combination di et of Ulva  sporelings, U. lens  and 
N. jeffreyi  has produced significantly larger juvenile H. laevigata  than the current 
commercial nursery diet (Daume  et al.  2007). Juvenile brown macroalgae have 
exhibited potential as an alternative nursery diet for several abalone species including 
Haliotis diversicolor  and H. discus hannai , but have not yet maintained suitable 
juvenile abalone growth rates for extended periods of time (Takami  et al.  2003, 
Onitsuka  et al.  2010, 2011). Given the preference of Australian ab alone for red 
macroalgae (Rhodophyta) over brown macroalgae (Phae ophyceae), it would be 
beneficial to utilise red macroalgal sporelings in the nursery system. 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 131  Research into the propagation methods of Rhodophyta  species identified 
carpospore release of Hypnea  through temperature and dark induction treatments 
(Section 3.3.1), as a suitable macroalgae and proto col for developing a sporeling diet on 
the PVC settlement plates in the nursery system. Th e establishment of Hypnea  fragment 
culture by vegetative propagation produced fast gro wth rates and high survival (Section 
3.3.3), indicating the species robust nature and su itability for use in aquaculture. Adult 
Hypnea  species thallium’s grown in flow-through integrate d systems (nutrient enriched) 
have been shown to produce growth rates of 80 to 12 6 µm.day -1 for juvenile  
H. tuberculata coccinea  (11 mm shell length) (Viera  et al.  2005). To reduce the amount 
of Hypnea  carposporophytic biomass required to produce adequ ate carpospore numbers 
and subsequently sporeling densities, incorporating  Ulva  sporelings as a combination 
diet could render red macroalgal sporelings suitabl e for commercial use. Given that 
sporelings may have different nutritional propertie s to adult macroalgae and with the 
inclusion of nutrient enrichment, the incorporation  of Hypnea  sporelings could provide 
the juvenile abalone with a greater range of dietar y nutrition, consequently producing 
faster growth rates with greater survival during th e later nursery phase. 
 
The use of non-toxic, encrusting, cyanobacterium as  an alternative algal diet 
may address the inadequate feed biomass due to the high grazing pressure of juvenile 
abalone in the later nursery phase. Cyanobacteria c an act as a food source for molluscs 
and as production of algae can be costly (Sharma  et al.  2011), genera such as 
Phormidium  could be suitable for juvenile abalone nutrition. Phormidium  are a  
red-pigmented, epiphytic, Cyanophyceae that can be found inhabiting deeper waters 
(Pintner & Provasoli 1958) where wild greenlip abal one reside ( ≈20 m). These  
“blue-green algae” are very fast growing, have simp le growth needs, rapidly absorb 
nutrients and are a good source of proteins (Fujimo to  et al.  1997, Sharma  et al.  2011). 
Their ease of culture would reduce the expertise an d labour required by the abalone 
nursery to utilise Phormidium  as a diet. As the algae are fast growing it may ha ve 
greater recovery post grazing than the current comm ercial nursery diet and 
consequently, be able to maintain sufficient algal biomass under the intense grazing 
pressure of juvenile abalone in the later nursery p hase. 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 132  A whole macroalgal thalli diet was developed for th e weaner system to examine 
the juvenile abalone nutritional transition from a diatom-based diet to a macroalgae-
based diet. This whole seaweed diet in the weaner s ystem may be a more suitable 
method of presenting the desired macroalgae, than s eeding sporelings into the nursery 
system. The diet also allows a direct comparison of  an adult macroalgal diet to an 
artificial diet in the weaner system, rather than r elying on macroalgal fragments adhered 
to the vertical plates in nursery tanks (Section 4. 2). 
 
The alternative management strategy of weaning juve nile abalone greater than  
8 mm shell length onto an artificial diet has been shown to produce significantly larger 
and faster growing abalone than the commercial nurs ery diet ( Laurencia  Fragment/Agar 
Diet Feeding Trial, Section 4.2.3). Even though the re was a high initial mortality, 
utilising the weaner system with an artificial diet  was an effective means of rearing 
juvenile abalone. However, to compare the nursery a nd weaner systems throughout the 
later nursery phase (5 – 15 mm shell length) weanin g at a smaller size needs to occur as 
it may affect the juvenile abalone performance on t he artificial diet. 
 
To culture juvenile abalone from 5 to 15 mm shell l ength through the later 
nursery phase, various potential diets and system d esigns have been identified and 
tested in this multi diet and system feeding trial,  as to their effect on H. laevigata  
growth and survival. A combination red ( Hypnea ) and green ( Ulva ) macroalgal 
sporeling diet, as well as a separate Cyanobacteria  ( Phormidium ) diet, were both 
compared to the current commercial nursery diet ( U. lens  plus N. jeffreyi ) for their 
suitability as alternative algal diets in the nurse ry system. These diets’ ability to supply 
adequate algal biomass to accommodate the intensive  grazing pressure of juvenile 
abalone during the later nursery phase, were also e valuated against the management 
strategy of rearing juvenile H. laevigata  in a weaner system on two separate diets of 
whole macroalgal thalli and an artificial feed.

 133  5.2.2 Feeding Trial Experimental Design 
Location 
The juvenile abalone feeding trial was conducted in  the aquaculture facilities at 
Western Australian Fisheries and Marine Research La boratories (WAFMRL) in 
Hillarys, Perth, Western Australia between June and  December 2006. Greenlip abalone 
(Haliotis laevigata ) were spawned in December 2005 and the juveniles p roduced by 
Bay Side Abalone Pty Ltd in Bremer Bay, Western Aus tralia. 
 
Algal Culture – Diets 
Mixed Sporeling Diet ( Hypnea  sp. and Ulva  spp. sporelings) 
Hypnea  sp. carposporophytes were harvested from the Wayle n Bay collection 
site and transported to the aquaculture facilities at WAFMRL (Section 2.1). Fertile 
Hypnea  thalli were placed into plastic trays and covered with moist newspaper, then 
exposed to three spore release induction treatments  as described in the large carpospore 
production experiment (Section 3.2.1). The temperat ure and dark treatments were 
applied simultaneously by storing the trays of Hypnea  at 4 oC in complete darkness for 
24 h, while the osmotic pressure treatment was cond ucted after by hand rinsing the 
thalli with deionised water for 10 min. Once the th ree treatments had been administered, 
430 g of Hypnea  carposporophyte thalli were placed on plastic mesh  submerged 5 cm 
under the water surface in a nursery tank. Ninety, 60 x 26 cm PVC plates were arranged 
vertically below the mesh and light aeration was su pplied to the non-flow through 
seawater (1 µm filtered, ICF). The fertile Hypnea  thalli were then left overnight (24 h) 
in the nursery tank to allow carpospore release. 
 
After 24 h the thalli were removed from the nursery  tank and the entire spore 
release induction procedure described above repeate d twice more. The Hypnea  
carposporophytes were induced for carpospore releas e on three consecutive occasions, 
each with a 24 h release period in the nursery tank , giving a total of 3 d for carpospore 
release. This multiple induction procedure allowed the carpospore yield attained in the 
large carpospore production experiment (Section 3.3 .1) to be replicated three times Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 134  within the nursery tank using the same macroalgal t halli. Before the Hypnea  thalli were 
added to the tank on each spore release occasion th e PVC plates were rotated 180 o about 
the horizontal to achieve even spore settlement. 
 
Ulva  spp. thalli were collected from the East Street Je tty site (Section 2.1) and 
exposed to the same temperature and dark treatment as in the Ulva  Sporeling Diet 
Feeding Trial (Section 5.1.2). Approximately 10 kg of Ulva  thalli were then placed into 
each of the three nursery tanks. Each tank had thre e baskets of ten, 60 x 26 cm PVC 
plates orientated horizontally with the non-flow th rough seawater (1 µm filtered, ICF) 
lightly aerated. The Ulva  thalli were removed from each tank after a week an d the 
baskets of 10 plates then stood upright in the vert ical position. 
 
The Hypnea  sporeling seeded plates and the Ulva  sporeling seeded plates were 
cultured separately for 6 weeks in nursery tanks, w ith non-flow through seawater (1 µm 
filtered, ICF) exchanged twice weekly and the algal  fertiliser Abasol added at each 
exchange (Section 2.2). The entire spore release, i noculation and culture procedure 
described above for both Hypnea  and Ulva  was repeated twice, so that the plates in the 
feeding trial could be replaced with newly seeded s poreling plates every 2 months. Just 
prior to the commencement of the trial (addition of  the juvenile abalone) the separate 
Hypnea  and Ulva  sporeling covered plates were combined into three nursery tanks of  
60 plates each. The sporeling-covered plates were a lternated, so that it was Hypnea  
sporeling plate, then Ulva  sporeling plate and so on throughout each nursery tank. 
 
Phormidium  sp. Diet 
The cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Phormidium  sp. was grown on glass 
microscope slides in 250 mL Petri dishes with f/2 m edium (Section 2.2, DFSW) at  
18 ± 2 oC on a 12 h:12 h, light:dark cycle at 35 µmol photons.m -2.s -1. The Phormidium  
culture was scaled up by placing the microscope sli des with the alga attached on the top 
of nine, intermediate 20 x 15 cm PVC plates orienta ted vertically in two non-flow 
through, 6 L glass aquaria with f/2 medium (CFSW) e xchanged twice weekly. Once the Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 135  Phormidium  had attached to these intermediate plates, the pla tes were then distributed 
into three nursery tanks with one plate placed acro ss the top of each basket containing 
twenty, 60 x 26 cm PVC settlement plates (9 baskets  total). Placing the stock culture 
microscope slides and the intermediate PVC plates a t the top of the next culture size 
plates allowed the Phormidium  to colonise the new plates and therefore, the cult ure 
could be scaled up to the nursery system. Three, no n-flow through nursery tanks with 
Phormidium  culture attached to the plates had the seawater (1  µm filtered, ICF) 
exchanged twice weekly with the addition of Abasol and light aeration. This inoculation 
and culture procedure for Phormidium  was repeated 4 times, to ensure there were new 
seeded plates available for replacement every month  of the trial, commencing after the 
2nd  month. 
 
Commercial Nursery Diet ( Ulvella lens  plus Navicula  cf. jeffreyi ) 
The preparation of the commercial nursery diet foll owed the protocol in General 
Materials and Methods Section 2.4.4 with only minor  alterations. Culture of N. jeffreyi  
began with 3 Petri dishes instead of 1 small bag an d were scaled up to 2, 1.5 L medium 
bags then 1, 60 L large culture bag and finally, 2 Mexican hats. Navicula cf.  jeffreyi  cell 
culture and MAF (Section 2.2.2) were added to the c ommercial nursery diet tanks on a 
weekly basis, while the induction protocol to relea se U. lens  spores was performed 
every 2 months. 
 
Whole Macroalgal Thalli Diet (WMT) 
Whole thalli of Gracilaria flagelliformis , Hypnea  and Ulva  were harvested from 
the various collection sites and transported to WAM RL as described in General Material 
and Methods Section 2.1. Thalli of the 3-macroalgal  species were mixed together and 
presented in three mesh pouches (40 x 15 cm, 10 mm gauge mesh) within each weaner 
tank (Figure 29) and fed weekly at a rate of 5 % bo dy weight per day (blotted wet 
weight macroalgae, live abalone). The tanks were cl eaned every second day and the 
pouches moved around the tank to provide the juveni le abalone greater access to the 
macroalgal thalli. Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 136  System Design 
The nursery and weaner systems were set up and main tained as detailed in 
General Material and Methods Section 2.4, with some  alterations outlined below. 
 
Nursery System 
The nursery tanks were arranged in 3 banks of 3 tan ks with one replicate of each 
diet treatment assigned to one of the banks using a  randomised block design. The 
nursery tanks housed 60 x 26 cm PVC settlement plat es and each of the 9 nursery tanks 
were stocked with 2400 juvenile greenlip abalone (6  mm shell length), averaging  
40 juveniles per plate (128 abalone.m -2). All the nursery system diets had their plates 
replaced with new algal seeded plates at regular in tervals during the feeding trial to 
maintain algal biomass. The water-soluble fertilise r Abasol (Section 2.2.2) was added to 
all the nursery tanks on a fortnightly basis to imp rove the nutritional composition of the 
algae throughout the trial. The baskets containing the PVC plates were rotated 180 o 
about the horizontal every fortnight to maintain a balance between algal biomass growth 
at the top of the plates and the grazing pressure f rom the photoperiod sensitive feeding 
of juvenile abalone at the bottom of the plates. 
 
Weaner System 
Weaner tanks were the 100 L Mexican hat tanks (1.3 m diameter) normally used 
for diatom culture (Section 2.4.4) (Figure 29). Eac h weaner tank was stocked with  
1500 juvenile greenlip abalone of 6 mm shell length  (1130 abalone.m -2). The WMT diet 
and an artificial diet (Section 2.4.2) were tested in the weaner system in separate tanks 
with 3 replicate tanks per diet. 
 
Measurements 
To measure the shell length and weight of the juven ile H. laevigata , a  
sub-sample of 100 abalone per tank was collected ev ery 2 weeks from all tanks in both 
the nursery and weaner systems. Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 137  
 
Figure 29: The Mexican hat tank used as a substitut e weaner tank, with the Whole 
Macroalgal Thallus (WMT) diet presented in the mesh  pouches. 
 
Abundance of the algal species in the nursery syste m diets were determined as 
described in General Material and Methods Section 2 .4.5. The Hypnea  and Ulva  
sporelings were measured as the number of sporeling  blades per cm 2, while the 
Phormidium  was recoded as an estimate of percentage cover on the settlement plate. 
The algal diets were all measured at the start and then fortnightly during the trial to 
determine the algal consumption by juvenile abalone . When new plates seeded with 
algae were introduced, the algal density remaining on the old plates was measured first 
and used to calculate the consumption rate for the previous time period (fortnight). The 
algal density on the new seeded plates was then mea sured before they were introduced 
to the tank and used as the initial algal density t o determine the consumption rate for the 
following time period (fortnight). 
 
Irradiance and mean seawater temperature were measu red throughout the trial to 
monitor the change in environmental conditions. The  irradiance was measured for all 
diet replicates (tanks) by a Digitech light meter a t the seawater surface while the tank 
was full, both when exposed to natural irradiance a nd covered with shade cloth. To 
compare irradiance across the three tank banks each  containing one replicate tank of the Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 138  nursery system diets, the abalone parameters were s tandardised. The abalone growth 
and survival in each replicate nursery tank were we ighted according to the proportion 
they differed from the diet treatments mean. Thermo cron General Purpose Loggers 
(OnSolution) placed in three tanks on separate tank  banks recorded the seawater 
temperature throughout the trial. 
 
Data Analysis 
Initial, week 2, week 16 and final shell length, to tal trial growth rate, specific 
growth rate, weight gain, initial mortality and tot al survival of the abalone on the diets 
were all compared separately using analysis of vari ance (one-way ANOVA). A 
Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance examined aba lone growth rates throughout the 
trial. If significant differences (p<0.05) between diets were observed the Tukey  
Post-Hoc test for multiple comparisons of means was  applied. 
 
Fortnightly algal consumption rates and the density  of Hypnea  and Ulva  
sporelings on the new seeded plates at the start, w eek 8 and 16 were assessed by 
analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Algal consump tion rates, mean fortnightly 
seawater temperature and irradiance were compared w ith juvenile abalone growth and 
survival through a Pearson Moment Correlation Analy sis. Irradiance was also examined 
between systems, diets and nursery tank banks by an alysis of variance (one-way 
ANOVA) with a Tukey Post-Hoc test identifying signi ficant differences (p<0.05) 
between means. 
 
5.2.3 Results 
Abalone Growth, Survival and Algal Consumption 
At the beginning of the feeding trial the juvenile H. laevigata  had a mean initial 
shell length of 5.82 ± 0.08 mm. The initial shell l ength of abalone stocked in each of the 
diet treatments was significantly different between  only two treatments; the commercial 
nursery system diet and the WMT diet in the weaner system (Table 20). During the first Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 139  week of the feeding trial the abalone exhibited ext remely high mortality, after being 
harvested and transported from the commercial farm Bay Side Abalone in Bremer Bay 
to the WAFMRL aquaculture facilities in Perth. A me an juvenile abalone mortality of 
29.7 ± 2.7 % in the nursery and 27 ± 1.9 % in the w eaner system was recorded after the 
dead animals were collected during regular maintena nce. However, the high mortality 
rates in the first week were not influenced by eith er the system or diet the juvenile 
abalone were stocked into (Table 21). Additional ju venile abalone were harvested from 
Bay Side Abalone and transported to WAFMRL, then st ocked into all replicate tanks in 
order to maintain the initial trial stocking densit ies. Week 2 was considered the official 
start point of the trial, because of the high morta lity and subsequent restocking during 
the first 2 weeks, and the significant difference b etween the initial shell lengths of 
abalone distributed into two diet treatments. The m ean juvenile abalone shell length at 
week 2 was 5.98 ± 0.02 mm, with no significant diff erence between the animals stocked 
into each diet treatment (Table 20). 
 
The juvenile abalone actively consumed the various feeds and increased in size 
on all diets over the 26-week trial. The increase i n shell length was similar across all 
diets for the first 14 weeks, until the juvenile ab alone reached approximately 9 mm shell 
length (Figure 30). Growth rates of juvenile abalon e fluctuated between  
27 and 40 µm.day -1 on all diets during this time period and were not significantly 
different (Table 22). At week 16 the abalone shell length was significantly smaller on 
the WMT diet compared to both the mixed sporeling a nd the commercial nursery diets 
(Tukey, p<0.05). This was the only significant diff erence recorded in any growth 
parameter up to this point of the feeding trial. Th erefore, the two experimental juvenile 
abalone nursery diets, mixed sporelings and Phormidium  can be considered comparable 
to the current commercial nursery system diet and t he artificial diet in the weaner 
system for growth of juvenile abalone less than 9 m m shell length. 
 
Consumption rates of the algal biomass in each diet  treatment played an 
important role in producing the similarity between juvenile abalone growth rates during 
the first 14 weeks of the feeding trial. Ulva  sporeling consumption decreased from  Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 140  150 to 0 sporeling blade.abalone -1.day -1 over the first 10 weeks. The inclusion of new 
seeded plates after week 8 caused the consumption r ate to increase back up to  
150 sporeling blade.abalone -1.day -1, before it gradually declined again until week 16 of 
the trial (Figure 31). The rate of Hypnea  sporeling consumption during the first half of 
the trial was approximately half that of the Ulva  sporelings, but did follow a similar 
trend by reducing to nearly 0 sporeling blade.abalo ne -1.day -1 by week 18 (Figure 31). 
The difference in the sporeling consumption of the two species was due to the density of 
Hypnea  sporelings being only 48.2 % of the Ulva  sporelings at the start of the trial. The 
U. lens  consumption varied between 0.06 and 0.02 % cover.a balone -1.day -1 during the 
first 10 weeks of the trial (Figure 32). The “negat ive” consumption rate at week 12 was 
due to an U. lens  spore release event (week 10). This subsequently p rovided additional 
U. lens  cover and therefore greater algal biomass on the p lates for the juvenile abalone, 
which in turn allowed the consumption rate to retur n to the range mentioned above. 
Phormidium  was readily consumed by the juvenile greenlip abal one and in the first  
2 weeks 77 % of the 87.1 % cover was removed (Figur e 33). The consumption during 
the next 6 weeks was minimal as very little Phormidium  biomass was available on the 
plates. The new seeded plates incorporated at week 8 and 12 presented the abalone with 
feed and subsequently the consumption rates increas ed until week 16. 
 
The consumption rates of algal biomass by juvenile abalone indicated a range in 
grazing tolerances of the various algal species, wi th U. lens  exhibiting the highest 
grazing resistance, followed by the mixed sporeling s then the Phormidium . This was 
particularly evident for the Phormidium  as the abalone removed nearly all of the algal 
cover in a short period of time and therefore, alga l regeneration on the plates was unable 
to occur. Ulvella lens  had visible grazing tracks in its cover but the al gae was not 
completely removed, which allowed regeneration. The se grazing tolerances dictated the 
diets’ algal cover, rate of removal and ability to maintain suitable biomass through to 
week 16 when new seeded plates were introduced to a ll diets. The Phormidium  diet had 
new seeded plates introduced twice at week 8 and 12 , the mixed sporelings diet at week 
8, while the commercial nursery diet had an induced  release of spores at week 10. This 
maintenance of algal biomass in the nursery system enabled the growth rates of juvenile 
abalone for the first 14 weeks to be similar across  the nursery and weaner diets (Table 
22). Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 141  After week 14 the abalone growth rates began to var y between diets resulting in 
different mean shell lengths (Figure 30). During we ek 16 to 20 the juvenile abalone on 
the mixed sporeling diet grew significantly faster at 64.13 ± 3.82 µm.day -1 than the 
other diets, apart from those abalone feeding on th e commercial nursery diet  
(45.42 ± 5.94 µm.day -1) (Table 22). Abalone consuming the other three die ts had similar 
growth rates of around 40 µm.day -1, which were only slightly higher than those 
achieved during the first 14 weeks of the feeding t rial. In the last 6 weeks of the feeding 
trial there was a further increase in abalone growt h rates on three diets, with the 
artificial diet producing 74.17 ± 4.12 µm.day -1, the commercial nursery diet  
78.06 ± 7.80 µm.day -1 and the mixed sporeling diet sustaining the maximu m growth 
rate recorded during the trial of 87.70 ± 4.50 µm.day -1 (Table 22). These three abalone 
growth rates were significantly faster than those p roduced on both the Phormidium  and 
WMT diets. Even though the juvenile abalone growth rates varied between diets in the 
different 6-week intervals during the trial (Table 22), overall they still demonstrated the 
same statistical relationship between diets as the total trial growth rate calculated 
utilising the week 2 and final shell lengths (Table  20). 
 
The variation in growth rates after week 16 was rel ated to the amount of biomass 
the new seeded plates could provide to the juvenile  abalone in each nursery diet. The 
new Ulva  sporeling seeded plates introduced after week 16 h ad a substantial effect on 
consumption rate by reducing it to -450 sporeling b lade.abalone -1.day -1 at week 18 
(Figure 31), which was significantly different than  any other fortnightly consumption 
rate (Tukey, p<0.05). The extremely high density of  sporelings on the new plates were 
able to reproduce faster than the juvenile abalone could consume them, resulting in the 
“negative” consumption rate. The density of Ulva  sporelings peaked at 185 sporeling 
blade.cm -2 during week 18, which was significantly greater th an the density on both the 
initial and week 8 new seeded plates (F (df 2,6) =61.168, p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05)). The 
greater sporeling density and therefore, higher alg al biomass per plate led to the increase 
in consumption rate (Figure 31) by the juvenile aba lone, and the subsequent 
significantly faster abalone growth rates during th e last 12 weeks of the trial (Table 22). 
The introduction of new seeded Hypnea  sporeling plates at week 16 also allowed the 
Hypnea  sporeling consumption rate by abalone to increase for the rest of the trial Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 142  (Figure 31). The density of Hypnea  sporelings on the new seeded plates at week 16 was  
significantly greater than that on the plates at th e start of the trial, but not the week 8 
plates (F (df 2,6) =6.435, p<0.05 (Tukey, p<0.05)). Sporeling consumpt ion rates of these 
two macroalgae were significantly, positively corre lated throughout the 26-week 
feeding trial (R=0.847, p<0.05) (Figure 31). 
 
New seeded plates of U. lens  were introduced to the tanks at week 16 because 
the biomass of the green alga had been grazed to on ly 16.2 % cover. The introduction of 
new seeded plates contributed to a “negative” consu mption rate as the algal density was 
increasing faster than the abalone could consume it . After this, the consumption rate 
then increased and even with another spore release at week 20, the rate remained 
positive for the remainder of the trial (Figure 32) . The consumption of N. jeffreyi  by the 
juvenile abalone was significantly, positively corr elated with that of U. lens  cover 
consumption during the trial (R=0.576, p<0.05). Aft er an initial consumption of  
100 x10 3 diatom.abalone -1.day -1 at week 2, the consumption rate of N. jeffreyi  remained 
on or under 0 diatom.abalone -1.day -1 until the last week of the trial (Figure 32). 
Inoculations of the diatom into the nursery tanks w ere conducted on a weekly basis and 
this constant supply caused the density (diatom.cm -2) in the tanks to increase faster than 
the juvenile abalone could consume them. Consequent ly, N. jeffreyi  was the only algal 
feed that did not exhibit significant differences b etween fortnightly consumption rates 
(F (df 12,26) =1.46, p=0.202). 
 
New seeded plates of the grazing conducive Phormidium , had to be added into 
the tanks at week 16 and 20 to maintain algal bioma ss to support the juvenile abalone. 
This resulted in fluctuating food availability and subsequently, variable algal 
consumption rates (Figure 33) and lower abalone gro wth rates than the mixed sporeling 
and commercial nursery diets. Overall, none of the algal consumption rates statistically 
correlated with the growth of juvenile abalone cons uming that particular diet. 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 143  At the end of the trial the mixed sporeling diet ha d produced the largest mean 
juvenile abalone shell length of 15.04 ± 0.26 mm, w hich was significantly bigger than 
that achieved on both the Phormidium  and WMT diets. The WMT diet in the weaner 
system produced the smallest abalone at 11.30 ± 0.0 3 mm shell length, which was 
similar to the abalone feeding on the Phormidium  diet, while the other 3 diets produced 
significantly larger abalone (Table 20). The growth  rate, specific growth rate and weight 
gain of juvenile abalone over the entire feeding tr ial exhibited the same statistical 
relationship between diets as the final shell lengt h, with the mixed sporeling diet 
producing the fastest and heaviest abalone growth ( Table 20). This relationship between 
growth parameters was exemplified by the abalone fe eding on the commercial nursery 
diet producing an identical final mean shell length  (13.9 mm) to the juveniles 
consuming the artificial diet in the weaner system.  This resulted in an almost identical 
total abalone growth rate (47 µm.day -1), specific growth rate (0.50 % length.day -1) and 
weight gain (2 µg.day -1) on both diets (Table 20). Even though the mixed s poreling diet 
was able to produce the greatest juvenile abalone g rowth (both as shell length and as 
weight gain) over the 26-week feeding trial, it was  not significantly superior to that 
recorded by abalone consuming the commercial nurser y diet or the artificial diet in the 
weaner system (Table 20). This indicates that all t hree diets, the mixed sporeling and 
commercial nursery diet in the nursery system, and the artificial diet in the weaner 
system would be suitable to sustain growth of juven ile abalone from 5 to 15 mm shell 
length throughout the later nursery phase. 
 
Another vital parameter in assessing the suitabilit y of the various diets was the 
survival of abalone over the entire trial. The surv ival on the various diets ranged from 
35.2 ± 2.2 % on the WMT diet to 62.8 ± 1.5 % on the  artificial diet, with the artificial 
diet having a significantly higher juvenile abalone  survival than the other four diets 
(Table 21). When the abalone survival on each diet was combined for its respective 
system, the survival in the nursery system of 44.8 ± 2.2 % was not significantly 
different to the survival of 49.0 ± 6.3 % in the we aner system. All analyses of growth 
and survival parameters did not show any significan t difference between the nursery and 
weaner systems, which could possibly indicate that the differences in abalone growth 
and survival were due to the diet consumed rather t han the system utilised.

Environmental Parameters 
Temperature 
During the feeding trial the mean seawater temperat ure increased from 15.3 oC in 
week 4 to 22.8 oC at the conclusion (Figure 30). The mean seawater temperature was 
colder than 18 oC for the first 14 weeks and corresponded to abalon e growth rates slower 
than 40 µm.day -1 on all diets. Once the temperature had surpassed 1 8 oC there were 
significant differences in abalone growth rates bet ween diets, specifically the increase 
recorded on the mixed sporeling, commercial nursery  and artificial diets (Table 22). In 
fact, the juvenile abalone growth rates on the mixe d sporeling diet (R=0.753, p<0.05), 
the commercial nursery diet (R=0.655, p<0.05) and t he artificial diet (R=0.605, p<0.05) 
showed significant, positive correlation with the r ise in mean seawater temperature 
throughout the trial. However, the mean seawater te mperature was only significantly, 
positively correlated with the consumption rates of  Hypnea  and Ulva  sporelings Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 151  (R=0.746, p<0.05 and R=0.618, p<0.05). Mean seawate r temperature could not be 
related to the algal biomass of the diets in the nu rsery system as the new seeded plates 
introduced at specific time intervals changed the d ensity of the algal species. The 
continued inoculation of N. jeffreyi  was the one exception and the diatoms abundance 
was significantly, positively correlated with tempe rature (R=0.904, p<0.05). 
 
Irradiance 
The irradiance the two systems received varied thro ughout the day, as well as 
over the entire feeding trial with a maximum, natur al, un-shaded irradiance of 518 µmol 
photons.m -2.s -1. All irradiance measurements used for comparison w ere taken at the 
water surface underneath the tank covers, to provid e a representation of what the algae 
and abalone were exposed to. The weaner system was deliberately constructed to be 
darker as it did not require sunlight to maintain a n algal diet and consequently, the 
irradiance recorded was significantly lower than th at of the nursery system  
(F (df 1,8) =16.580, p<0.05). In the weaner system there was no  significant difference 
between the irradiances the WMT and artificial diet  each received (F (df 1,8) =0.836, 
p=0.387). 
 
The nursery system required natural irradiance thro ughout the trial to maintain 
suitable algal biomass of each diet. The irradiance  received had an effect on the amount 
of algae present within the tanks of each diet, whi ch subsequently affected the growth 
and survival of the juvenile abalone. The nursery s ystem design of diet replicates 
(tanks), randomised between 3-nursery tank banks ha d significant differences between 
the irradiance the banks received (Table 23). The w estern bank was exposed to a mean 
irradiance of 36.26 ± 8.69 µmol photons.m -2s-1 throughout the trial, which was 
significantly greater than the 12.63 ± 2.77 µmol photons.m -2s-1 the eastern bank 
received. This variation in irradiance from east to  west across the nursery tank banks 
coincided with a significant increase in the standa rdised growth and survival of the 
juvenile abalone in the western bank (Table 23). Gi ven the randomisation of diet 
replicate tanks, none of the abalone growth rates p roduced on the 3 nursery algal diet 
treatments correlated with irradiance during the tr ial. Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet

5.2.4 Discussion 
Juvenile abalone growth rates on all five diets wer e remarkably similar  
(27 – 40 µm.day -1) during the first 14 weeks of the multi diet and s ystem feeding trial. 
This was further emphasised by only the WMT diet ha ving a significant difference in 
shell length at week 16 to the mixed sporeling and the commercial nursery diets, which 
could be attributed to sufficient algal biomass bei ng supplied to the juvenile abalone in 
the nursery diets. However, this similarity in grow th for the first 14 – 16 weeks was 
unusual as variation in growth on different diets g enerally occurs earlier in feeding trials 
(demonstrated below), even though delayed growth an d extended weaning periods have 
been reported (Day & Fleming 1992, Garcia-Esquivel & Felbeck 2009). The Ulva  
Sporeling Diet Feeding Trial (Section 5.1.3) showed  that Ulva  sporelings were an 
appropriate diet for juveniles of 3.5 – 6 mm shell length, while the commercial nursery 
diet was acceptable for larger juveniles (>6 mm she ll length). Haliotis laevigata  of the 
same size range had significantly faster growth rat es during the first 4 weeks of a trial 
on an U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  diet, then once they reached 9 mm shell length the  juveniles 
on an artificial diet had significantly faster grow th rates (Daume  et al.  2007). This was 
the same outcome as the abalone growth differences between the commercial nursery 
and the artificial diet in the Laurencia  Fragment/Agar Diet Feeding Trial (Section 
4.2.3). These studies highlight the rare, extended period of similar abalone growth 
exhibited in this trial, particularly between algal  nursery diets and artificial diets in the Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 153  weaner system, as artificial diets are generally le ss suitable feeds for juveniles  
5 – 10 mm shell length and typically result in slow er growth and higher mortalities 
(Daume & Ryan 2004). 
 
After week 16 of the feeding trial abalone growth b egan to vary between diets, 
as evident in the divergences of shell length profi les (Figure 30) and the significant 
difference in growth rates during the last two 6-we ek intervals (Table 22). Importantly, 
this variation in growth occurred when the juvenile  abalone reached approximately  
9 – 10 mm shell length. Up until this size range, a ll diets other than the WMT diet were 
able to sustain acceptable juvenile abalone growth rates. Thus indicating a wide variety 
of diets in both the nursery and weaner systems can  be utilised to rear juvenile greenlip 
abalone of less than 9 – 10 mm shell length. The gr owth of juvenile abalone on the 
nursery macroalgal diets in both the Ulva  Sporeling and Laurencia  Fragment/Agar Diet 
Feeding Trials (Section 5.1.3 and 4.2.3) also exhib ited this transition at 9 – 10 mm shell 
length. Daume et al.  (2007) confirmed this transitional size range in t wo separate 
feeding trials using the current commercial nursery  and weaner diets, as well as a 
composite diet of Ulva  sporelings, U. lens  and N. jeffreyi . This transitional size range 
can be considered a key point in the later nursery phase, as it’s when commercially 
viable growth rates decline due to insufficient alg al biomass, requiring either the 
addition of algal biomass into the nursery system o r weaning onto artificial diets 
(Fleming  et al.  1996, Dunstan  et al.  2002, Daume  et al.  2004). This multi diet and 
system feeding trial incorporated both scenarios to  allow a detailed comparison of 
which system and diet best suits the rearing of juv enile greenlip abalone. 
 
The growth rates of juvenile abalone on the commerc ial nursery diet and 
artificial diet in the weaner system both increased  after week 16 to over 70 µm.day -1. 
Different species of juvenile abalone have attained  these growth rates on various 
artificial diets in the later part of extended feed ing trials (Fleming  et al.  1996, Daume  et 
al.  2007, Dlaza  et al.  2008, Garcia-Esquivel & Felbeck 2009). However, th e 
commercial nursery diet generally produced these ab alone growth rates at the earlier 
size ranges (5 mm shell length) when food availabil ity was high, but rarely when the Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 154  juveniles were over 10 mm shell length and feed lim itation has become an issue (Daume 
& Ryan 2004, Daume  et al.  2007). Dyck et al.  (2010) utilised a combination diet of  
U. lens  and an artificial feed in specifically designed V nursery tanks to achieve growth 
rates of well over 100 µm.day -1 for juvenile H. iris  ( ≈5 to 15 mm shell length) during 
the later part of two trials (88 and 122 d). The de crease in consumption of U. lens  within 
the combination diet also indicated the transition from the algal to artificial feed when 
the abalone were 8 – 9 mm shell length. Therefore, the early stage growth rates of 
approximately 70 µm.day -1 in the Dyck et al.  (2010) trial are more likely a 
representation of U. lens  consumption, while the high abalone growth rates o f over  
100 µm.day -1 in the later stages of the trial were produced by artificial feed 
consumption. Given there was no significant differe nce in abalone growth rates or 
survival between a diatom ( Nitzschia longissima )/artificial feed diet where the diatoms 
were consumed in 4 – 5 d, and an U. lens /artificial feed diet which had at least 20 %  
U. lens  cover towards the end of the trial (88 d) (Dyck  et al.  2010), it could be 
suggested that the growth rates of juvenile abalone  were solely dependent on the 
artificial feed throughout the trial and not either  of the algal species. 
 
The mixed sporeling diet in the present feeding tri al actually produced the fastest 
growth rate of 87.7 ± 4.5 µm.day -1 during the last 4 weeks. In fact, this composite r ed 
and green macroalgal sporeling diet recorded the la rgest, fastest growing and heaviest 
juvenile abalone over the entire trial. It can ther efore, be considered a suitable 
alternative macroalgal diet when compared to the cu rrent commercial nursery and 
weaner system diets for the later nursery phase of juvenile abalone production. The 
abalone growth rate obtained during the last 4 week s on the mixed sporeling diet was 
similar to that recorded on the monospecies Ulva  sporeling diet (Section 5.1.3). 
However, that growth rate was only produced during the first 6 weeks of the trial with 
animals of less than 6.5 mm shell length, while the  mixed sporeling diet produced the 
fast growth rate during week 22 – 26 with juveniles  of greater than 12 mm shell length. 
This may suggest the inclusion of Hypnea  sporelings was able to improve the overall 
performance and addressed the deficiencies in the m onospecies, Ulva  sporeling diet. 
The mixed sporeling diet could have achieved this b y creating a more balanced diet with Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 155  the essential nutrients required by juvenile abalon e (Day & Fleming 1992, Fleming 
1995b, Brown  et al.  1997, Simpson & Cook 1998). 
 
Abalone consuming mixed algal diets generally perfo rm better than those 
feeding on monospecies diets, as shown by the mixed  sporeling diet in this feeding trial 
producing the fastest growth rates. Ulva  thalli as part of combination diets has been 
shown to improve growth rates in various juvenile a balone species (Stuart & Brown 
1994, Simpson & Cook 1998), while a mixture of L. japonica  and Gracilaria 
lemaneiformis  was one of the best performing diets for H. discus hannai  (75 mm shell 
length) (Qi  et al.  2010). A red, green and brown composite macroalgal  diet as well as a 
combination diet of Ecklonia maxima  and farmed U. lactuca , produced the best growth 
for H. midae  in two separate trials of 35 mm and 20 mm shell le ngth animals, 
respectively (Naidoo  et al.  2006, Robertson-Andersson  et al.  2011). Enriched U. rigida , 
Hypnea spinella  and Gracilaria cornea  combined, also performed significantly better 
than when fed to H. tuberculata coccinea  (12.5 mm shell length) as single macroalga 
diets (Viera  et al.  2011). Even though these mixed diets produced good  abalone growth 
rates, they utilised whole adult thalli of the macr oalgae fed to larger juvenile abalone 
(>12.5 mm shell length). To accommodate this, diffe rent culture systems including 
baskets, cages and containers, rather than the PVC settlement plates in the nursery 
system were used to present the mixed macroalgal di ets to abalone. In this trial the 
incorporation of the WMT diet ( G. flagelliformis , Hypnea  and Ulva ) into the weaner 
system using mesh pouches allowed the growth of juv enile abalone consuming adult 
macroalgal thalli to be compared with abalone fed m acroalgal sporelings. 
 
The WMT diet produced the smallest, slowest growth rate and lowest weight 
gain abalone of all the diets in the multi diet and  system feeding trial. This was the 
complete opposite to the mixed sporeling diet and m ay be because two forms of the 
same macroalgal species can have different nutritio nal and structural properties (Van 
Alstyne  et al.  1999). However, the more direct cause of the signi ficantly slower growth 
on the WMT diet was the mesh gauge (10 mm) of the p ouches the algae were presented 
in, as the juvenile abalone had difficulty accessin g the macroalgal thalli once they Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 156  reached around 9 mm shell length. The pouches were designed for ease of feeding and 
cleaning, however it may be more appropriate to enc lose the abalone in baskets, cages 
or containers as in the mixed, adult thalli macroal gal diet feeding trials mentioned 
above, but specifically constructed to accommodate juvenile abalone of 5 – 15 mm shell 
length. The use of the WMT diet in Australian nurse ries would require completely new 
abalone production systems and macroalgal culture f acilities to be created. Therefore, 
macroalgal sporelings seeded on settlement plates i n the nursery system has been shown 
to be the most appropriate method of exposing a mix ed diet of macroalgae to juvenile 
abalone within Australian abalone farms. 
 
There are only a small number of studies utilising macroalgal sporelings for 
juvenile abalone nutrition and this feeding trial w as the only study using a red 
macroalga specie ( Hypnea ). In the Ulva  Sporeling Diet Feeding Trial (Section 5.1.4) it 
was mentioned that growth rates of 100 µm.day -1 have been obtained by 3 – 4 mm shell 
length H. discus discus  when fed on a variety of monospecies sporelings (M aesako  et al.  
1984). While Takami et al.  (2003) has shown that the brown macroalga L. japonica  can 
be first utilised by H. discus hannai  at 1.8 mm in shell length, with growth rates up to  
80 µm.day -1 achievable on the juvenile sporophytes, however co nsiderable variation in 
juvenile growth between algae and developmental sta ges of abalone was present. Recent 
small scale studies have indicated that juvenile H. diversicolor  of greater than 3 mm 
shell length can achieve growth rates of more than 60 µm.day -1 when feeding on 
gametophytes of the brown alga Eisenia bicyclis , while animals greater than 5 mm shell 
length fed on juvenile sporophytes (Onitsuka  et al.  2010). A similar study utilising 
juvenile gametophytes of the brown algae E. bicyclis , Ecklonia cava  and Undaria 
pinnatifida  showed growth rates of 100 µm.day -1 were easily attainable for juvenile  
H. diversicolor  of 3 – 8 mm shell length (Onitsuka  et al.  2011). A mixed diet of  
U. rigida  sporelings and U. lens  used to settle H. tuberculata coccinea  and test four 
diatom species as post-larval feed, showed a sudden  increase in growth rates to  
94 µm.day -1 on all diatom diets for juveniles of 2 mm shell le ngth, signifying a dietary 
shift from the diatom species to the green macroalg ae (Courtois de Vicose  et al.  2012). 
 Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 157  The only use of macroalgal sporelings to the semi-c ommercial scale as in this 
multi diet and system feeding trial, was the Ulva  sporeling diet used in Section 5.1 and a 
mixed Ulva  sporeling, U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  diet which produced juvenile H. laevigata  
growth rates of 105 µm.day -1 (Daume  et al.  2007). The incorporation of three algal 
species covering the juvenile abalone dietary range  (diatoms – crustose algae – 
macroalgae) may have improved the overall nutrition al profile of the diet. The addition 
of red macroalgal sporelings into this tri-species diet would further increase the algal 
biomass across the abalone dietary range and could maintain higher abalone growth 
rates for an extended later nursery phase. 
 
The very fast growing, simple to culture, Phormidium  diet was only able to 
produce a total feeding trial juvenile abalone grow th rate of 38.38 ± 2.97 µm.day -1, 
which remained relatively constant throughout with a maximum of  
45.39 ± 7.05 µm.day -1 between week 22 – 26. This was only slightly slowe r than the 
60.3 µm.day -1 H. discus discus  juveniles of 3.6 mm shell length produced on 
Phormidium fragile , while other cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) spec ies including 
Entophysalis deusta  and Plectonema golenkiniatum  have been able to achieve 
considerably faster growth rates of 96.7 and 86.7 µm.day -1 over 30 d trials (Maesako  et 
al.  1984). The savings in time and resources for a com mercial nursery due to the ease of 
Phormidium  culture would not offset the relatively slow juven ile abalone growth rate it 
produced in this trial. The use of the cyanobacteri um E. deusta  and P. golenkiniatum  
may be feasible due to the faster abalone growth ra tes achieved, depending on what 
duration (month) these species can provide adequate  biomass throughout the later 
nursery phase. 
 
Over the multi diet and system feeding trial, the f inal shell length, growth rate, 
specific growth rate and weight gain showed the sam e statistical trend across all diets, 
making these four measurements of abalone growth in terchangeable when identifying 
the most suitable juvenile abalone diet. The mixed sporeling diet produced the highest 
growth parameters; followed by the commercial nurse ry diet and the artificial diet, Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 158  while the Phormidium  diet recorded lower growth parameters, with the WM T diet 
resulting in the smallest juvenile abalone. 
 
Abalone survival over the 26-week feeding trial did  not exhibit the same 
relationship between diets as all the growth parame ters identified. The artificial diet in 
the weaner system had a significantly higher abalon e survival of 62.8 ± 1.5 % than all 
the other diets. This was lower than the 73.6 % aba lone survival on the artificial diet in 
the Laurencia  Fragment/Agar Diet Feeding Trial (Section 4.2.3), however it did occur 
over a three times longer time period. The abalone survival in this trial was very similar 
to the 65 and 62 % on artificial diets shown in two  shorter feeding trials using similar 
size juvenile H. laevigata  (Daume  et al.  2007). Survival on the mixed sporeling and the 
commercial nursery diets were just under 50 %, whic h was higher than the abalone on 
the monospecies diet of Ulva  sporelings and similar to the commercial nursery d iet 
survival in Section 5.1.3. However, it was consider ably lower than the 68 to 82 % 
abalone survival on the U. lens /N. jeffreyi  diet and the Ulva  sporeling/ U. lens /N. jeffreyi  
diet in Daume et al.  (2007). The lower survival on natural diets was un usual given the 
animals came from a natural ( U. lens /diatom) diet, which generally reduces the weaning 
process when compared to artificial diets (Fleming  et al.  1996). The weaning process 
from the juvenile abalone onto all diets may have b een masked by the high mortality 
(28.5 %) that occurred in the first week of the tri al. The mortality was not significantly 
different between systems or diets and can be attri buted to the source abalone nurseries 
husbandry and harvesting, as well as transporting t he animals which can impose great 
stress where juvenile mortalities in excess of 50 %  have been reported (Pang  et al.  
2006). To overcome the husbandry, harvest and trans port mortality all the nursery and 
weaner tanks were restocked to initial trial densit ies. 
 
Juvenile abalone growth and survival did not signif icantly correlate to any of the 
nursery algal diet consumption rates. There were re lationships within diets as the 
consumption of Hypnea  sporelings correlated with Ulva  sporelings, indicating there 
may have been no preference for either species. Thi s correlation was also present 
between the consumption rate of U. lens  and N. jeffreyi . Rather than the growth and Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 159  survival of juvenile abalone correlating with algal  consumption rates, the incorporation 
of new seeded algal plates had a substantial impact  on growth. The correlation between 
the monospecies Ulva  sporeling diet consumption and abalone growth occu rred because 
it was a single inoculation diet and had no increas e in biomass during its trial (Section 
5.1.3). The regular input of algal material in this  feeding trial caused fluctuations in 
consumption rates. However, this was not instantly translated into changes in growth 
rates because of juvenile abalone predisposition to  go long periods without food, 
subsequently reducing metabolic activity while util ising their own energy stores 
(Fleming  et al.  1996, Durazo-Beltrán  et al.  2004). 
 
In the mixed sporeling diet, consumption of both al gae showed a decrease just as 
the new seeded plates were incorporated and a sharp  increase in the following sample 
period. The initial decrease in consumption was cau sed by the sporelings growing faster 
than the juveniles could consume them, while the su bsequent rapid increase in 
consumption was directly dependent on the higher al gal biomass provided on the new 
plates. The substantial increase in consumption rat es of both macroalgae after week 18 
was due to the significantly greater density of spo relings on the new seeded plates, 
compared to the plates at the start for Hypnea  and at the start and week 8 for Ulva . The 
incorporation of these new seeded plates at week 16  and the subsequent increase in 
consumption, translated into the significantly fast er growth rate of the juvenile abalone 
on the mixed sporeling diet. 
 
The consumption of U. lens  generally fluctuated between 0.02 and 0.06 % 
cover.abalone -1.day -1, except when it became “negative” after a spore re lease event 
occurred. Even U. lens  with a higher grazing resistance than the sporelin gs and several 
spore release events, had its cover reduced to 16.2  % at week 18 and subsequently, new 
seeded plates were introduced. The increase in alga l biomass by the introduction of new 
plates corresponded to the increase in growth rates  during the second half of the trial. 
Regular inoculation of the diatom N. jeffreyi , caused the consumption rate by juvenile 
abalone to be “negative” for almost all of the tria l and was subsequently, the only feed 
that did not show significant fluctuations in consu mption rate. This may also be Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 160  attributed to the juvenile abalone size, as the tra nsition from a diatom-based diet to 
macroalgae-based diet occurs during the earlier par t (5 – 10 mm shell length) of this 
feeding trial (Kawamura  et al.  1998b, Takami & Kawamura 2003). 
 
The Phormidium  diet was the most heavily grazed, as shown by the 77 % 
decrease in cover at the start of the trial and the  subsequent drop in consumption rate 
over the following 6 weeks due to a lack of biomass  present. The high consumption rate 
required new seeded plates to be incorporated more often than the other nursery diets. 
Therefore, the fast growing cyanobacteria could not  accommodate the feeding pressure 
of the juvenile abalone and the growth rate in the last 6 weeks was significantly slower 
than the other two nursery diets. 
 
The fluctuations in consumption rates and the reduc tion in algal biomass during 
this feeding trial indicated the algal species tole rance to grazing could play an important 
role in the ability of a diet to support juvenile a balone. Generally abalone nurseries seek 
nutritionally adequate algal species that have suff icient grazing tolerance to support the 
pressure of juvenile abalone (Parker  et al.  2007). The green alga U. lens  currently used 
in Australian nursery systems has a high attachment  strength onto the PVC plates, 
which can be problematic for consumption by juvenil es less than 3 mm shell length 
(Kawamura 1996, Daume  et al.  2000, Huggett  et al.  2005). Other Ulvophyceae species 
have shown to be easily grazed by abalone less than  3 mm shell length and have greater 
recovery rates following grazing (Dyck  et al.  2011). However, it was the intensive 
grazing pressure applied by juvenile abalone of up to 9 – 10 mm shell length, which 
reduced all diets tested in this feeding trial to a n insufficient biomass regardless of the 
algal species attachment strength. 
 
All three algal nursery diets required new seeded p lates to be incorporated and 
without their introduction the diets would have had  insufficient biomass to support 
juvenile abalone throughout the trial. For the Phormidium  diet this occurred very early 
in the feeding trial and the diet would not have su stained the animals much past the first Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 161  2 months ( ≈7.5 mm shell length). The mixed sporeling diet biom ass would have become 
inadequate around week 12 to 14 ( ≈9 mm shell length) of the feeding trial. This 
corresponded to similar time periods for the monosp ecies Ulva  sporelings diet to reach 
insufficient algal biomass in the Ulva  Sporeling Diet Feeding Trial (Section 5.1.3), as 
well as when the density of Ulva  sporelings reduced to minimal numbers in the Daume  
et al.  (2007) nursery feeding trial. The commercial nurse ry diet would have lasted 
slightly longer; even with spore release events it was still reduced to insufficient 
biomass by week 16 ( ≈9 – 10 mm shell length). This was longer than the 1 4 weeks 
required too reduce the cover of U. lens  to 11 % in Section 5.1.3 and the 9 weeks it took 
juvenile abalone in Daume & Ryan (2004), both from similar initial U. lens  cover. In 
order to maintain commercially viable growth rates of juvenile greenlip abalone greater 
than 9 – 10 mm shell length throughout the later nu rsery phase, new seeded algal plates 
had to be introduced. Through the incorporation of new seeded algal plates both the 
mixed sporeling diet and the commercial nursery die t were able to provide sufficient 
algal biomass, resulting in improved growth rates a nd allowing the juvenile abalone to 
remain in the nursery system until they reached 14 – 15 mm shell length. 
 
Juvenile abalone growth rates on the mixed sporelin g, commercial nursery and 
artificial diets were significantly and positively correlated with the increase in mean 
seawater temperature during the 26-week trial. When  the temperature was below 18 oC 
abalone growth rates were similar across all diets.  As the temperature rose after week 14 
the abalone growth rates became significantly faste r on the three diets mentioned above. 
This pattern in growth rates was also evident with juvenile H. laevigata  feeding on an 
Ulva  sporeling/ U. lens /N. jeffreyi  diet when the temperature passed 16 oC (Daume  et al.  
2007). These results indicate that juvenile abalone  growth rates may increase with rising 
temperatures if diets can provide sufficient algal biomass during the later nursery phase. 
Abalone growth rates were fastest at the end of the  trial when the temperature reached 
22.8 oC. Growth rates of H. discus hannai  (>4.6 mm shell length) consuming U. lens  and 
benthic diatoms have been shown to increase with te mperature and exhibited superior 
growth rates at 22.5 oC (Uki  et al.  1981). Juvenile H. tuberculata  (3.22 mm shell length) 
produced faster growth rates when cultured at 22 oC compared to 15 and 18 oC, while  
H. iris  (10 mm shell length) recorded maximum growth at 22oC (Lopez  et al.  1998, Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 162  Searle  et al.  2006). Britz et al.  (1997) determined that growth of H. midae  (17.5 mm 
shell length) on an artificial diet significantly i ncreased with temperature until 20 oC 
after which a sharp decline occurred, indicating th e possibility of temperature 
thresholds. However, a 50 % critical thermal maximu m of 27.5 oC and an optimum 
growth temperature of 18.3 oC has been reported for H. laevigata  (Gilroy & Edwards 
1998). The optimal temperature occurred during week  14 of this feeding trial when 
juvenile abalone growth rates on the mixed sporelin g, commercial nursery and artificial 
diets began to increase, indicating that juvenile H. laevigata  benefit from being cultured 
at seawater temperatures greater than 18 oC. Unfortunately culturing juvenile greenlip 
abalone during the later nursery phase at higher te mperatures would be an unrealistic 
possibility for many commercial farms given their s outhern location and subsequent 
cool incoming seawater (<18 oC). Also in Australia, greenlip abalone are general ly 
spawned in the later part of the year and based on post settlement abalone growth rates 
and available nursery tank space, the juvenile abal one (>9 – 10 mm shell length) are not 
able to be maintained in the nursery system during the period of warmer seawater. 
 
The irradiance received by the growing algae in the  nursery system diets was 
significantly different to that received by the wea ner system, however this did not 
translate into disparity in abalone growth rates be tween the two systems. The variation 
in abalone growth parameters between the WMT and th e artificial diet in the weaner 
system were not due to irradiance, as there was no difference between the irradiance the 
two diets’ tanks received. Irradiance did have an e ffect in the nursery system, however 
the effect was not between diets but rather between  the replicate tanks within each diet. 
The variation from east to west across the nursery tank banks produced a significant 
increase in standardised growth and survival of juv enile abalone in the bank that 
received the greatest irradiance. This indicated th at irradiance has an important effect on 
the algal biomass present and subsequently juvenile  abalone growth. The effect of 
irradiance on diatom diets has been shown to be of particular importance in postlarval 
feeding and development (Daume  et al.  2004, Gorrostieta-Hurtado & Searcy-Bernal 
2004). Randomisation of nursery tanks across the ir radiance gradient played an 
important role in removing irradiance as an environ mental factor that altered the 
juvenile abalone response to a specific nursery alg al diet. Chapter 5 – Macroalgal Sporeling Diet 
 163  The half-year, multi diet, semi-commercial feeding trial demonstrated that the 
nursery and weaner systems were equally effective i n producing juvenile greenlip 
abalone from 5 to 15 mm shell length. The variation  in all juvenile abalone growth and 
survival parameters through the later nursery phase  were not affected by the system 
utilised to rear the animals, but rather by the typ e and biomass of diet they were able to 
consume. The faster juvenile abalone growth rates ( shell length and weight) over the  
26-week feeding trial produced on the mixed sporeli ng diet ( Hypnea /Ulva ), allowed it 
to be considered a suitable alternative to the curr ent commercial nursery  
(U. lens /N. jeffreyi ) and weaner (artificial) diets. Incorporating new seeded plates of the 
mixed macroalgal sporeling diet provided adequate a lgal biomass to sustain the intense 
grazing pressure of juvenile abalone and produced c ommercially viable growth rates, 
permitting the juvenile H. laevigata  to remain in the nursery system throughout the 
entire later nursery phase.

 164  CHAPTER 6 
GENERAL DISCUSSION 
The reliable supply of suitable algal species in su fficient biomass has been 
shown to be fundamentally important to the nutritio n and development of juvenile 
Haliotis laevigata  in the commercial nursery system. The use of inapp ropriate algal 
varieties or a reduction in algal biomass on the PV C plates can have significant impacts 
on the growth and survival of post settlement abalo ne. This in turn, has considerable 
implications for the later development of abalone a nd subsequently, the overall 
commercial production and profitability of abalone culture in land based facilities. 
Therefore, the central aim of this thesis was of pa rticular importance given it was to 
identify, develop and evaluate alternative macroalg al diets for juvenile greenlip abalone, 
that supply sufficient algal biomass to maintain co mmercially viable abalone growth 
rates throughout the later nursery phase. In addres sing the central aim, this research was 
the first in juvenile abalone culture to: 
1) Identify carpospore liberation and vegetative pr opagation as macroalgal 
propagation methods for incorporating Rhodophyta sp ecies into juvenile abalone diets 
within the nursery system. 
2) Utilise vegetative fragments of a red macroalga with the aid of a specifically 
developed artificial adhesion protocol for a juveni le abalone diet on a semi-commercial 
scale in the nursery system. 
3) Incorporate high macroalgal biomass by seeding s porelings as a diet to 
address the intense grazing pressure of juvenile ab alone and maintain growth rates 
above current diets on a semi-commercial scale in t he nursery system. 
 
By accomplishing these three outputs, juvenile gree nlip abalone of 5 mm shell 
length were able to be cultured to 15 mm shell leng th at commercially appropriate 
growth rates, therefore improving the later nursery  phase production of abalone 
aquaculture. Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 165  In assessing the ability of various red macroalgae to be incorporated into the 
juvenile abalone nursery system, three propagation methods of spore liberation, 
protoplast production and vegetative propagation we re examined. All three propagation 
methods were able to produce in vitro  cultures of a variety of red macroalgal species 
that would be suitable for juvenile abalone consump tion (Section 3.3). Even though 
high-density macroalgal biomass could be theoretica lly attained to seed the nursery 
plates, it was not only the amount of biomass produ ced but also a range of factors that 
determined the propagation methods suitability to d evelop juvenile abalone diets. 
Biological factors including the source macroalgae biomass required, 
propagule/fragment characteristics and adhesion abi lity were taken into consideration, 
while the methodology, costs and ability to be util ised can have considerable bearing on 
whether a commercial abalone farm can incorporate t he propagation methods into their 
standard operating procedures (Table 24). 
 
Protoplast production was a prime example of being biologically capable of 
producing high propagule biomass to seed a juvenile  abalone diet on the vertical PVC 
plates. However, its methodology and costs associat ed made it impractical for utilisation 
in an abalone nursery (Table 24). Given only 1 g bl otted wet weight of Gracilaria  sp. 
thalli produced 28.83 ± 8.69 x10 5 protoplasts (Section 3.3.2), it significantly redu ced the 
amount of macroalgal biomass required too seed the nursery plates. This was the 
greatest number of propagules produced per gram alg a out of three propagation methods 
and had the added benefit of being attained from an y section of the thallus, from any 
phenotypic stage of the alga. The benefits associat ed with the source macroalgal 
biomass required are impressive, as it would remove  the pressure on harvesting wild 
macroalgal populations, as well as reducing the cos ts associated with on site macroalgal 
culture. However, these benefits for abalone nurser ies would be offset by the limited 
and time-consuming regeneration capacity of protopl asts (e.g. Yan & Wang 1993, 
Yeong  et al.  2008), as well as the requirement for an artificia l adhesion protocol to 
attach the protoplasts/callus formations to the pla tes. These two factors both add to 
protoplast productions already specialised and cost ly methodology, therefore, 
outweighing the biological benefits associated with  propagule production and the 
reduced biomass of source macroalgae required. Thus  making the development of a Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 166  juvenile abalone nursery diet through protoplast pr oduction an unfeasible proposition in 
a commercial abalone farm (Table 24). 
 
Vegetative propagation through fragmentation can al so utilise any part of the 
thalli from any phenotypic stage of macroalgae, mak ing the harvest or culture of algal 
biomass relatively quick and easy (Table 24). This removes the problems associated 
with the triphasic life cycle of Rhodophyta and the  collection of fertile material, hence 
its use as a propagation method in commercial macro algal cultivation through the 
regenerative capacity of thalli fragments (e.g. San telices & Varela 1995, Oliveira  et al.  
2000). Fragment cultures of Hypnea  sp. and Gracilaria  were established with low 
fragment mortality and adequate growth rates after the initial wound-healing period 
(Section 3.3.3). Given the limited attachment rate of the macroalgal fragments to a 
substratum, artificial adhesion protocols were deve loped to allow the Hypnea  and 
Gracilaria  fragments to be attached to the PVC plates utilise d in the abalone nursery 
system. An active immobilisation protocol incorpora ting the sulphated galactan agar as 
a gelling agent and a spraying methodology, allowed  an agar/macroalgal fragment 
mixture to be adhered onto the plates (Section 4.1) . The need for artificial adhesion 
protocols dictated the characteristics of macroalga l fragments that could be 
incorporated; hence successful in vitro  cultivation alone did not necessarily translate 
into a macroalgal species’ suitability for use as a  juvenile abalone diet. 
 
Laurencia  sp. actually proved the most appropriate alga for incorporation into 
the artificial adhesion protocols and was able to b e examined as an alternative 
macroalgal diet in the later nursery phase. The Laurencia /agar diet was comparable to 
the current commercial nursery diet ( Ulvella lens /Navicula  cf. jeffreyi ) for juvenile  
H. laevigata  growth (8 – 11 mm shell length) and survival durin g a 12-week feeding 
trial (Section 4.2.3). Weight gain was the exceptio n, with the abalone consuming the 
commercial nursery diet being significantly heavier  at the end of the trial, causing 
implications for the total production biomass of an  abalone farm when the animals reach 
marketable size. However, both algal diets examined  were unable to accommodate the 
high grazing pressure of the juvenile H. laevigata  once they had reached 10.5 mm shell Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 167  length. This was evident by the decline in growth r ates and lack of algal biomass 
available towards the end of the feeding trial, con sequently restricting the diets use in 
commercial abalone farms during the later nursery p hase. Overall the Laurencia /agar 
diet produced slightly fewer and smaller abalone th an the commercial nursery diet. 
However, it was the inability for the diet to remai n adhered to the plates and therefore, 
the need for regular re-application that defined th e Laurencia /agar diets ineffectiveness 
during the later nursery phase (Table 25). 
 
Harnessing the natural recruitment of macroalgae th rough attachment and 
germination of spores can be an effective means of attaching a high biomass of red 
macroalgae to the PVC plates. This removes the need  for artificial adhesion protocols, 
which in turn significantly reduces the labour and costs associated with creating an algal 
diet for juvenile abalone in the nursery system (Ta ble 24). Even without the artificial 
adhesion protocols costs, cultivation of macroalgae  through vegetative propagation can 
generally be more expensive than via the release of  spores (Alveal  et al.  1997). Spore 
liberation utilises simple equipment, while vegetat ive propagation methods currently 
used in commercial cultivation can be cumbersome, l abour intensive, time consuming 
and inefficient (Halling  et al.  2005, Mantri  et al.  2009). The economic benefits of 
utilising spore liberation over vegetative propagat ion are clear, as seeding the PVC 
plates in the abalone nursery system with spores re duces the costs associated with 
methodology, labour, equipment, while also removing  the need for time consuming and 
costly artificial adhesion protocols (Table 24). 
 
The biological benefits of spore liberation are als o important as a relatively 
small amount of algal biomass can produce large num bers of spores as seed. The mean 
carpospore production for Hypnea  from all three induction treatments of temperature , 
dark and osmotic pressure was 67.23 ± 10.19 x10 3 carpospores.g -1 alga, while the 
temperature treatment and culture conditions of 25 ± 2 oC and 10 µmol photons.m -2.s -1 
liberated 140.21 ± 19.73 x10 3 carpospores from only 1 g of carposporophytic thal li 
(Section 3.3.1). These carpospore liberation rates allow the nursery plates to be seeded 
using far less macroalgal material than by vegetati ve propagation, which can consume Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 168  significant amounts of biomass. For example, 430 g of carposporophytic Hypnea  was 
able to seed ninety, 60 x 26 cm PVC plates condense d in one nursery tank, to a 
sporeling density of up to 44.5 ± 5.5 sporelings.cm-2 present after 2 months of culturing 
(Section 5.2.2). The use of vegetative fragments fr om any phenotype of Laurencia  
thalli, required 1.8 kg to seed sixty, 60 x 26 cm P VC plates to a maximum density of 
3.06 ± 0.09 fragments.cm -2 directly after application (Section 4.2.2). Given the 
sporelings were cultured for 2 months they were a s imilar length but slightly thinner 
than the fragments, however the difference in size does not counter act the substantial 
difference in density. The variation in biomass of source macroalgae required really 
becomes evident when an abalone nursery diet of mac roalgal sporelings produced from 
carposporophytic Hypnea  can last months being grazed by juvenile abalone ( Section 
5.2.3), while the Laurencia /agar diet had to be re-applied weekly. This re-app lication 
meant nearly 60 kg of Laurencia  biomass was required for the 12-week Laurencia  
Fragment/Agar Diet Feeding Trial (Section 4.2), whi ch scaled up to a nursery system 
under full production at a commercial abalone farm would be an unacceptable amount 
of macroalgal biomass to source. 
 
The excessive macroalgal biomass required for culti vation using vegetative 
propagation has lead to the commercial macroalgae i ndustry looking at seed production 
through spore release as a way of improving mass cu lture. Seeding by spore liberation 
has been shown to reduce the initial stock biomass required and have high production 
potential with uniform sporeling densities, indicat ing the possibility for use in 
commercial field cultivation (Alveal  et al.  1997, Mantri  et al.  2009). A direct 
comparison of spore and vegetative seeded rope cult ivation of the red alga Gracilaria 
chilensis  by Halling et al.  (2005), indicated that during the first month the propagation 
methods had comparable alga biomass growth. However , after a biomass loss event 
from the spore-seeded ropes caused patchy low densi ties, the vegetative seeded ropes 
produced higher alga productivity. The biomass loss  was attributed to the alga’s 
morphology as it lacked a developed attachment disk  and this combined with the open 
water location of the trial, resulted in the attach ment strength being insufficient to 
maintain the macroalga on the ropes (Halling  et al.  2005). Given juvenile abalone 
aquaculture occurs in tanks the algal biomass doesn ’t deal with excessive natural forces, 
allowing lower attachment strengths to be utilised.  However, adhesion strength of the Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 169  algal biomass can’t be minimal, as it’s still requi red to have sufficient grazing resistance 
to accommodate the intense grazing pressure of juve nile abalone while not be rapidly 
depleted (Dyck  et al.  2011). This further highlights the importance of a ppropriate 
macroalgal adhesion to the unique vertical PVC plat e substrata in the abalone nursery 
system, as even with a propagation method incorpora ting natural attachment properties 
care still needs to be taken when selecting the mos t suitable macroalgal species. 
 
Even though relatively little red macroalgal biomas s was required to produce 
high amounts of propagules through the release of s pores, the biomass harvested must 
be from specific phenotypic stages, namely the carp osporophyte or tetrasporophyte 
stage. Given these phenotypes can have varying abun dances in the wild population due 
to seasonality and sexual maturity (e.g. Kain 1982,  Engel  et al.  2001), it can be difficult 
to harvest sufficient appropriate phenotypes for sp ore liberation. This was evident in the 
collection of fertile Plocamium mertensii  for the preliminary, small-scale spore 
production experiment (Section 3.3.1) and was taken  into account when utilising spore 
liberation as a method of seeding the plates in the  nursery system. This can be overcome 
to some degree by cultivation on site and utilising  carposporophyte developed in culture 
(e.g. G. chilensis ), even if the carpospore production capacity may b e slightly reduced 
(Section 3.3.1). Harvesting/culturing of fertile ph enotypes does produce limitations for 
the use of spore liberation in creating a diet for juvenile abalone. However, these 
limitations can be countered by numerous other bene fits, including the propagule 
characteristics, adhesion ability, ease of methodol ogy, and the reduced costs of 
production (Table 24). Even though all three macroa lgal propagation methods (spore 
liberation, protoplast production and vegetative pr opagation) can produce in vitro  
cultures, given the plethora of factors associated,  spore liberation was considered the 
most desirable propagation method for developing ju venile abalone diets in commercial 
abalone nurseries (Table 24).

 Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 171  By utilising the macroalgal natural adhesion method s of spore liberation, 
settlement and germination it allows algae from oth er Phylum to be developed into 
juvenile abalone diets. The Chlorophyte Ulva  was able to produce a high density, 
macroalgal sporeling diet on the PVC plates within the nursery system as its 
reproductive and morphological characteristics faci litated a high spore liberation 
capacity (Hoxmark 1975, Hiraoka  et al.  2003, Mantri  et al.  2011). The Ulva  spp. 
sporeling diet was comparable to the current commer cial nursery diet for the survival 
and growth of juvenile abalone, producing a similar  growth rate and specific growth rate 
over a 14-week feeding trial (Section 5.1.3). The g rowth of juvenile abalone in the 
range of 3.5 to 6.5 mm shell length was shown to be  significantly greater when feeding 
on the Ulva  sporeling diet. This implies the Ulva  sporelings had a lower grazing 
resistance than U. lens , which can be difficult for juveniles less than 3 mm shell length 
to feed on due to its high attachment strength (Dau me  et al.  2000, Dyck  et al.  2011). 
Importantly, the use of Ulva  sporelings improved the transition from a diatom-b ased 
diet to a macroalgae-based diet juvenile abalone ex hibit around 5 – 10 mm shell length. 
This transition between algal forms can be a proble m in commercial nurseries and the 
use of Ulva  sporelings could be included from settlement as a means of reducing the 
transitional impacts on juvenile abalone (<5 mm she ll length) growth (Table 25). 
 
The high biomass Ulva  sporeling diet was not able to accommodate the gro wth 
requirements of larger juvenile abalone in the late r nursery phase, even though it had the 
ability to improve early nursery phase production ( Table 25). The commercial nursery 
diet produced significantly larger growth for juven iles in the range of 6.5 to 10 mm shell 
length and subsequently, bigger abalone at the end of the trial (Section 5.1.3). The 
inability of the Ulva  sporeling diet to maintain growth comparable to th e current nursery 
diet for larger juvenile abalone may have been due to its monospecies nature and 
biochemical composition. The commercial nursery die t was shown to have a 
biochemical composition closer to the optimum level s required for juvenile abalone 
growth, while the Ulva  sporeling diet may of become limited in particular  nutrients 
important to abalone growth. 
 Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 172  The grazing pressure of the juvenile abalone (9 – 1 0 mm shell length) towards 
the end of the feeding trial became too great for b oth diets and biomass limitation 
resulted, consequently the growth of juvenile abalo ne suffered. Even utilising the high 
biomass and natural adhesion properties of Ulva  sporelings, the diet was still unable to 
overcome the problem associated with biomass limita tion in the later nursery phase. To 
tackle the reduction in biomass and nutrient limita tion due to a monospecies diet, a 
mixed sporeling diet consisting of Hypnea  and Ulva  sporelings was developed. By 
utilising a red macroalga as part of a mixed sporel ing diet, it reduced the number of 
plates in the nursery system to be seeded with Hypnea  sporelings. This decreased the 
amount of fertile phenotype source biomass required , which was identified as the only 
limitation to utilising spore liberation as a propa gation method for seeding a 
Rhodophyta species into a juvenile abalone diet wit hin the nursery system (Table 24). 
 
The mixed sporeling diet produced growth rates simi lar to the commercial 
nursery diet during the first 14 weeks of the Multi  Diet and System Feeding Trial 
(Section 5.2.3). Given that the monospecies, Ulva  sporeling diet could not maintain 
growth rates similar to the commercial nursery diet  over 14 weeks, this indicated the 
inclusion of the red macroalgal ( Hypnea ) sporelings improved the nutrient profile of a 
sporeling diet and removed the nutrient limitation associated with larger juvenile 
abalone consuming single species diets. Therefore, commercial abalone farms would 
benefit from suppling a mixture of macroalgae rathe r than a single species, to produce a 
well-balanced juvenile abalone nursery diet. 
 
All nursery system diets examined in the Multi Diet  and System Feeding Trial 
(Section 5.2) – mixed sporeling, commercial nursery , Phormidium  sp. – produced 
comparable growth rates for the first 14 – 16 weeks , indicating that a wide variety of 
algal species can be utilised by commercial abalone  farms to grow juvenile H. laevigata  
to 9 mm shell length (Table 25). Algal biomass stil l became limiting, just as with the 
Ulva  sporeling and Laurencia /agar diets, signifying 9 – 10 mm shell length can be a 
critical point in the production of juvenile abalon e in the nursery system. To overcome 
the algal biomass limitation new seeded plates of t he diets were introduced to the Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 173  nursery system, increasing algal biomass and by doi ng so demonstrated the ability of the 
mixed sporeling diet to improve juvenile abalone pr oduction in the later nursery phase. 
The mixed sporeling diet was able to produce the la rgest, heaviest and fastest growing 
juvenile abalone throughout the entire nursery phas e from 5 to 15 mm shell length, 
therefore, accomplishing the central aim of this re search. Even though the growth of 
juvenile abalone consuming the mixed sporeling diet  were greater, they were not 
significantly different to the abalone on the curre nt commercial diet. These results 
indicate the mixed sporeling diet with new seeded p lates introduced, would be a viable 
alternative diet for commercial abalone farms to ut ilise while rearing juvenile abalone in 
the nursery system (Table 25). 
 
Comparing different juvenile abalone management str ategies by changing 
system design from the nursery to weaner system, di d not improve production of 
juvenile abalone. The artificial diet utilised in t he weaner system produced slightly 
smaller and lighter abalone with a slower growth ra te compared to the mixed sporeling 
diet in the nursery system (Section 5.2.3). Both di ets were considered similar for rearing 
juvenile abalone less than 9 mm shell length, which  was unusual given growth rates and 
survival directly after weaning onto artificial die ts are usual lower than on natural diets 
(Daume & Ryan 2004, Daume  et al.  2007), as was the case in the Laurencia  
Fragment/Agar Diet Feeding Trial (Section 4.2). If no new algal biomass can be 
introduced to the nursery system, artificial diets in the weaner system are considered the 
most suitable strategy for rearing juvenile abalone  over 9 mm shell length (Section 
4.2.3). Given that algal biomass was maintained by incorporating new seeded plates in 
the Multi Diet and System Feeding Trial (Section 5. 2), the mixed sporeling and 
commercial nursery diets both produced comparable g rowth to weaning juvenile 
abalone onto an artificial diet. In a cost benefit analysis of juvenile abalone production 
via the nursery system compared to early weaning on to artificial diets using the exact 
same systems as in this study, the running costs of  the two management strategies were 
shown to be fairly comparable (Cook 2007). Overall,  the mixed sporeling and 
commercial nursery diets with the inclusion of new algal biomass in the nursery system 
and the artificial diet in the weaner system are ap propriate management strategies to 
rear juvenile abalone in the Australian abalone aqu aculture industry (Table 25).

 Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 175  In conclusion, propagation methods (spore liberatio n) that utilise natural 
adhesion can produce substantial macroalgal biomass , efficiently and cheaply on the 
PVC settlement plates utilised in the current abalo ne nursery system. Given the 
nutritional dietary transitions juvenile abalone ex perience due to the ontogenetic 
changes in their development, commercial abalone nu rseries would be best served by 
incorporating a succession of algal forms and speci es that are simple to culture, provide 
high biomass and are of an appropriate grazing resi stance. Daume (2006) proposed a 
timeline for abalone nutrition from settlement to 1 5 mm shell length in aquaculture. By 
examining macroalgal propagation methods this resea rch was able to expand on the 
limited information available for juvenile H. laevigata  nutrition (>3 mm shell length) in 
the later nursery phase and develop the timeline in to a detailed feeding regime (Table 
26). This regime can be considered an important exp ansion for the abalone aquaculture 
industry, as it would allow the most appropriate nu trition source to be available to 
juvenile abalone at all times during the nursery ph ase. Thus, removing any reduction in 
growth rates or increase in mortality due to monosp ecies diets, lack of algal biomass or 
weaning onto artificial diets at an inadequate size . The design of the Australian abalone 
nursery system would be able to accommodate such a feeding regime, as plates seeded 
with different algal species and biomass can be int erspersed throughout tanks at 
different times and densities with relative easy. T hrough a staggered, multi algal species 
feeding regime (Table 26) the nursery phase would b e able to produce uniform, large, 
high quality juvenile abalone biomass. This improve d nursery management strategy 
would have the considerable flow on effect of incre asing growth and abalone production 
throughout the entire commercial abalone farm.

 177  6.1 FUTURE STUDIES 
The examination into macroalgal propagation methods  for providing algal 
biomass for juvenile abalone nutrition, will assist  Australian abalone aquaculture to 
improve commercial production in the later nursery phase and provide a solid basis for a 
range of research possibilities. This study not onl y contributes to the available 
knowledge on juvenile H. laevigata  growth and survival in the nursery system, but als o 
the significance of juvenile macroalgae in the diet ary transition of juvenile abalone from 
a diatom-dominated to a macroalgal-dominated diet a t approximately 5 – 10 mm shell 
length, while further advancing macroalgal cultivat ion methods for aquaculture. 
 
The present study has shown that the algal propagat ion method of spore 
liberation was the most suitable methodology for de veloping macroalgal diets on the 
PVC settlement plates in the nursery system (Table 24). Given the requirements of 
specific phenotypes for spore liberation of Rhodoph yta species and the variability of 
these in wild populations, on site macroalgal culti vation was identified as a possibility 
to improve the source algal biomass supply. Cultiva tion of macroalgal species already 
occurs around the world as the supply of natural st ocks can’t meet the current demand, 
particularly in the commercially important agarophy te algae such as Gracilaria  (Zemke-
White & Ohno 1999, Reddy  et al.  2008b). A majority of this cultivation occurs usin g 
vegetative propagation on suspended rope systems in  the ocean, shallow ponds or tanks 
(Santelices & Doty 1989, Oliveira  et al.  2000). This cultivation method can be 
extremely useful in an integrated aquaculture syste m with fish farm cages, and has been 
shown to increase biomass production of the Rhodoph yta species G. chilensis  and 
Macrocystis pyrifera , while also increasing the algae’s nutrient conten t through 
bioremediation (Troell  et al.  1997, Buschmann  et al.  2008). 
 
The principles of integrated aquaculture systems ar e not limited to ocean culture 
and can be applied to a combination of commercial i mportant species including fish, 
shrimp, abalone, sea urchin, other shellfish and al gae in land based systems (Neori  et al.  
2004). Generally aquaculture facilities treat carni vore production waste with trophically 
lower organisms, which can then create revenue-gene rating cultivation of the secondary Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 178  organism (Neori 2008). This methodology can be appl ied to abalone aquaculture where 
the waste produced from can be utilised for macroal gal production, subsequently 
developing a low cost feed for abalone. These integ rated abalone, macroalgae 
aquaculture systems are currently being explored an d utilised in countries such as South 
Africa, where abalone culture utilises a high bioma ss of macroalgae as feed with the 
dominant specie of kelp (Ecklonia maxima ) now reaching maximum sustainable limits 
(Troell  et al.  2006). Given abalone growth improves with mixed ra ther than 
monospecies diets, other macroalgal species includi ng Gracilaria  and Ulva  are being 
produced through integrated cultivation and examine d as possible alternative algal diets 
for abalone in South African farms (Robertson-Ander sson  et al.  2008, Bolton  et al.  
2009). This developing body of research on integrat ed abalone and macroalgal 
cultivation can be transposed to Australian abalone  production and would allow on-site 
culturing of the macroalgal phenotypic biomass requ ired for spore liberation. This 
would reduce the reliance on wild harvest algae and  allow the propagation method of 
spore liberation to be extremely effective in produ cing high biomass macroalgal 
sporeling diets on the nursery plates for juvenile abalone culture. 
 
On farm cultivation of macroalgae allows a diversif ication of species to be 
cultured and subsequently utilised as mixed sporeli ng diets. Research into the spore 
production of the Rhodophyte Palmaria palmata  for abalone hatcheries has been carried 
out (Le Gall  et al.  2004), while sporelings of the brown algae Eisenia bicyclis , Ecklonia 
cava  and Undaria pinnatifida  have shown positive results for juvenile Haliotis 
diversicolor  (<10 mm shell length) growth on a very small-scale  (Onitsuka  et al.  2010, 
2011). The present study found that the mixed spore ling diet of Hypnea  and Ulva  was a 
viable alternative diet for raising juvenile H. laevigata  in the nursery system (Table 25), 
which opens up future research into the myriad of a lgal combinations possible for 
juvenile abalone diets. A composite Ulva  sporeling, U. lens  and N. jeffreyi  diet has 
already been developed based on research within thi s thesis and was shown to produce 
significantly larger juvenile H. laevigata  than the current commercial nursery diet 
(Daume  et al.  2007). These multi species diets, given the improv ement in juvenile 
abalone growth appear to be the future for commerci al abalone production. 
 Chapter 6 – General Discussion 
 179  Another area of important research to come out of t his study would be to utilise 
these macroalgal sporeling diets not only in variou s combinations but also in 
conjunction with artificial diets, to further reduc e the effects of the weaning process. A 
study incorporating the benthic diatom Nitzschia longissima  and U. lens  with artificial 
feeds in specifically designed tanks has already sh own marked improvement in growth 
and survival of juvenile Haliotis iris  during the weaning process (Dyck  et al.  2010). By 
combining algae and artificial diets together it al lows the juvenile abalone to seamlessly 
transition from one diet to the other without the s tress of harvesting and weaning. 
Supplementation of artificial diets with wild adult  macroalgal thalli has been shown to 
significantly improve growth for post weaning (>12 mm shell length) Haliotis midae  
(Dlaza  et al.  2008), however, these juvenile abalone were cultur ed in baskets to 
incorporate the characteristics of both diets. The nursery and weaner/growout systems in 
Australian abalone farms are currently treated as s eparate entities and utilising a 
combination of algae and artificial diets will requ ire significant research into an optimal 
combined system design. Before an entirely new syst em design would be utilised in 
Australian abalone farms, characteristics including  tank design, water flow, irradiance 
and husbandry protocols would have to investigated and produce significant 
improvements on current culture practices. 
 
The present study has developed a new macroalgal sp oreling diet for juvenile 
abalone nutrition in the nursery system and demonst rated its’ ability for commercial 
abalone production. This research provides a solid basis for future investigation into 
integrated culture of grazing tolerant macroalgal s porelings for juvenile abalone less 
than 3 mm shell length in the early nursery phase, as well as the combination of algal 
species and artificial diets to improve weaning of juvenile abalone greater than 15 mm 
shell length from the nursery system to the growout  system in commercial abalone 
farms. The research presented in this thesis provid es a significant step forward in 
commercial production of juvenile greenlip abalone ( H. laevigata ) in the current 
Australian abalone aquaculture systems.
