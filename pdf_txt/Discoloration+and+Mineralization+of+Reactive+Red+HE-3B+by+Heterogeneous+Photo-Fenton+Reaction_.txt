The catalytic activity of natural vanadium–titanium magnetite was investigated in the decolorization
of Acid Orange II by non-homogeneous Fenton process. The natural catalysts puriﬁed by magnetic sep-aration were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing microscope, X-ray absorption ﬁnestructure (XAFS) analysis and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The obtained results show that the natural sam-ples after magnetic separation mainly contain titanomagnetite, with a small amount of ilmenite andchlorite. Titanomagnetite is doped with vanadium, whose the valency is mainly +3 and occupies theoctahedral site. Batch decolorization studies were performed to evaluate the inﬂuences of various exper-imental parameters like initial pH, the amount of catalyst and initial concentration of hydrogen peroxideon the decolorization efﬁciency of Acid Orange II. The decolorization of the dye mainly relied on degra-dation. The degradation efﬁciency was strongly dependent on pH of the medium where it increased asthe pH decreased in acid range. The increase of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide could accelerate thedegradation. The catalytic property of natural vanadium–titanium magnetite in the degradation of AcidOrange II was stronger than that of synthetic magnetite (Fe
3O4). The catalytic activity of the natural
samples was greatly related to the titanomagnetite content. The degradation process was dominated byheterogeneous Fenton reaction, complying with pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate law. The natural catalyst has agood catalytic stability.

1. Introduction
Recently, non-homogeneous Fenton technologies using iron
oxides as catalysts have received a great deal of attention [1–5] .
A variety of organic pollutants (e.g. phenol, dye and pesticide)could be effectively degraded through non-homogeneous processusing iron oxides as catalysts, including goethite, lepidocrocite,hematite and magnetite [6–13] . Compared with other iron oxides,
the catalytic activity of magnetite in these non-homogeneous Fen-ton systems seems more interesting since magnetite contains bothFe
2+and Fe3+, the crucial cations for initiation of Fenton reac-
tion according to the classical Haber–Weiss mechanism [14–16] .
Also, magnetite is magnetic and can be easily separated from theterminal solution by magnetic separation, making it available forﬂow-bed technologies.
With the advantages of strong catalytic activity, wide dis-
tribution, great reserves and excellent environmental harmony,

the structure of magnetite, iron can be replaced by some transi-tion metals (e.g. Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) while maintaining theinverse spinel structure [18–21] . The isomorphous substitution
plays a great inﬂuence on the activity of the resulting magnetite.The introduction of transition metals such as Ti, Cr, Mn and Coin the spinel lattice can strongly improve the catalytic proper-ties of magnetites and also inﬂuence their thermal stabilities.For example, the doping of Cr can directly enhance the catalyticproperty in the H
2O2decomposition and methylene blue degra-
dation while it also leads to a promotion in the heat stability[19] .
So far most relative studies have just focused on the cat-
alytic activity of non-doped magnetite (Fe
3O4) and transition metal
doped magnetites (Fe 3−xMxO4, M = Cr, Co, Mn, Ni), which are all
single-phase materials synthesized in the laboratory [14,19,22,23] .
However, little attention has been paid to the catalytic propertyof natural magnetite. In fact, magnetite naturally doped with var-ious transition metals widely exists on the earth surface, whichmay be an immense resource of catalyst and greatly inﬂuence thegeochemical processes of organic pollutants.

Fig. 1. The chemical structure of Acid Orange II.
In this study, the catalytic activity of natural vanadium–titanium
magnetite and the relative controlling factors were investigated inthe decolorization of Acid Orange II. The main oxidation mecha-nism in this system was non-homogeneous reaction with hydrogenperoxide as oxidant, usually present and easily decomposed in rain-water [24] . Therefore, this study primarily concentrated on the
degradation of dye catalyzed by natural magnetite using hydro-gen peroxide as oxidant and it also played a simulation of thedecomposition of pollutants by natural mineral. The new insightsobtained in this study are of high importance for the developmentof novel materials in environmental decontamination and goodunderstanding of the transfer and transformation of pollutants onthe earth surface.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All chemicals and reagents used in this study are of analytical
grade. Acid Orange II (C
16H11N2SO 4Na, C.I. 15510, C.I. Acid Orange 7,
M.W.: 350.32, certiﬁed pure) was purchased from Shanghai Chemi-cal Reagent Company and used as received. Its chemical structure isshown in Fig. 1 . Deionized water was used to make the dye solutions
of desired concentration.
The samples of natural vanadium–titanium magnetite (named
as M1, M2 and M3) were collected from Pan-Xi region, a famous irondeposit in Sichuan Province, China. These samples were puriﬁedby magnetic separation before characterization and decolorizationexperiment. After magnetic separation, quartz and most of the clayminerals were eliminated. Magnetite (Fe
3O4, named as M0) was
synthesized by means of a precipitation–oxidation method withsulfate as starting material, which was pro rata oxidized to ferricsalts by NaNO
3after alkalinizing with NaOH. The synthesis proce-
dure of M0 has been reported in detail in other Refs. [25,26] . All
the samples were ground and passed through a 200 mesh screen(0.074 mm).
2.2. Characterization of magnetites
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were recorded
between 10
◦and 80◦(2/DC2) at a step of 1◦min−1using a Bruker D8
advance diffractometer with Cu K /H9251radiation (40 kV and 40 mA).
The mineral composition in the natural magnetite was obtainedfrom XRD patterns by Kvalue method.
Natural magnetite M2 was observed under polarizing micro-
scope Leica DMRX, using orthogonal polarization under transmit-ted light, with 10 ×63 as power of magniﬁcation.
The V K-edge X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) spectra
of natural vanadium–titanium magnetite M3 and reference com-pounds were collected on beamline 1W1B of Beijing SynchrotronRadiation Facility (BSRF). The BSRF storage ring is operated atthe electron energy of 2.2 GeV with beam current of 250 mA. The1W1B is a focused X-ray beamline, using a Si (1 1 1) double crys-tal monochromator. The V K-edge XAFS spectra of V
2O3,V O 2andV2O5reference compounds were measured in transmission mode,
and that of M3 was collected in ﬂuorescence mode with a Lytledetector and a Ti foil ﬁlter.
For
57Fe Mössbauer measurement, 250–335 mg of the powder
sample without any chemical pretreatment was gently pressedinto a brass sample holder (16 mm in diameter, 1 mm thick). Thesample holder was closed on two ends with iron free plastic tap.The Mössbauer spectra were obtained with a Mössbauer spec-trometer Austin Science S-600 using a /H9253-ray source of 1.11 GBq
57Co/Rh at a consistent temperature (293 K). Spectra were ﬁtted
to Lorentzian lineshapes using standard line shape ﬁtting routineswith a personal computer. Half-width (HW) and peak intensity ofeach quadruple doublet was constrained to be equal. Isomer shifts(IS) were expressed with respect to the centered of the spectrumof metallic iron foil.
2.3. Decolorization of azo-dye Acid Orange II
The experiments were carried out in a conical ﬂask (contain-
ing 200 mL of reaction solution). The temperature was controlledto 25
◦C. The dosage of catalyst was 0–2.0 g L−1while the con-
centrations of Acid Orange II and H 2O2were 0.2 mmol L−1and
0–20 mmol L−1, respectively. All the experiments were carried out
under constant stirring to make the catalyst well dispersed. The pHof solution was adjusted by H
2SO 4and NaOH. Before degradation
reaction, the suspension containing catalyst and Acid Orange II wasstirred for 1 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium. Then the degra-dation reaction was initiated by adding H
2O2into Acid Orange II
solution.
At given intervals of degradation, each sample was analyzed
by UV–vis spectroscopy UV-7504 at a wavelength of 484 nm, themaximum absorption wavelength of Acid Orange II. The concen-tration of Acid Orange II was converted through the standard curvemethod of the dye. The UV–visible absorption spectra were mea-sured by PerkinElmer Lamboda 850 for each sample. Total organiccarbon (TOC) concentration was analyzed in a Shimadzu TOC-VCPHanalyzer to evaluate the mineralization of dyes. Before centrifuga-tion and analysis, all the samples were immediately treated withequal volume of prepared scavenging reagent in order to stop thereaction in the samples. The prepared scavenging reagent con-tained 0.1 mol L
−1Na 2SO 3, 0.1 mol L−1KH 2PO 4, 0.1 mol L−1KI and
0.05 mol L−1NaOH, to obtain accurate TOC values [27,28] .
Four hours after the degradation experiment started, the reac-
tion solution was ﬁltered through a Millipore ﬁlter (pore size0.22/H9262m) to remove the solid catalysts. Then H
2O2and Acid Orange
II were added to the ﬁltrate, to build a homogeneous Fenton reac-tion system catalyzed by dissolved iron [29] . The concentrations
of Acid Orange II and H
2O2were 0.2 mmol L−1and 10 mmol L−1,
respectively. The operation of homogeneous Fenton reaction wassimilar to that of heterogeneous Fenton reaction mentioned above.
Four hours after the degradation experiment started, the near-
infrared diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy of ﬁnal degradationproducts was recorded on a Bruker Vector 70 Fourier transforminfrared spectrometer. The infrared signal was obtained by a MCTdetector. Diffuse reﬂectance spectra were recorded at 4 cm
−1reso-
lution with 64 scans over the spectral range 1750–1000 cm−1, the
main wavelength range of the absorption peaks of Acid Orange II.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts3.1.1. XRD, XAFS and polarizing microscope
XRD patterns of synthesis magnetite (M0) and natural
vanadium–titanium magnetites (M1, M2 and M3) are shown in114 X. Liang et al. / Journal of Hazardous Materials 181 (2010) 112–120
Fig. 2. X-ray diffraction patterns of series of magnetites (M, magnetite; T, titano-
magnetite; I, ilmenite; C, chlorite).
Fig. 2 . The characteristic reﬂections of M0 well correspond to the
standard card of magnetite (JCPDS: 19-0629, not shown). Thisindicates that synthetic magnetite has spinel structure [30,31] .
The XRD patterns of the natural samples show that all the nat-ural vanadium–titanium magnetites consist of titanomagnetite(2/DC2= 35.5
◦, 43.1◦, 62.6◦), ilmenite (2 /DC2= 32.6◦, 40.1◦, 23.8◦) and
chlorite (2 /DC2= 12.5◦, 25.4◦, 34.0◦). Ilmenite and chlorite are the
common minerals coexisting with titanomagnetite in naturalvanadium–titanium magnetites.
The image of M2 under polarizing microscope is provided in
Fig. 3 . The black grains are titanomagnetite and ilmenite, coexisting
as intergrowth. The transparent ones are chlorite, with the granulediameter ranging from 2 /H9262mt o7 /H9262m, extensively dispersed in the
samples.
From previous studies, the titanomagnetite in Pan-Xi region
is vanadium-rich titanomagnetite [21,32] . The normalized XANES
spectra for vanadium K-edge of M3 and reference compounds areshown in Fig. 4 . The V K-edge XANES of these oxides exhibit a pre-
edge absorption feather from V
2O3to V 2O5, followed by a strong
peak in the vicinity of about 20 eV. The vanadium K-edge of M3 dis-plays a rather different feather from those vanadium oxides. A weakpre-edge absorption appears, and two other should be observed inthe absorption edge. This indicates vanadium in titanomagnetite isimpossible to exist as these vanadium oxides. Because the shapeof absorption edge is affected by the symmetry of vanadium andthe energy position of the absorption edge is difﬁcult to deﬁne, thevalence state of vanadium in M3 cannot be determined by chemicalshifts. The correlations between normalized pre-edge peak area andits centroid position have been studied by Chaurand et al. [33] , and

can be used to determine to the valence state and symmetry. For
vanadium in the natural magnetite, the pre-edge peak area is ratherlow, and the centroid is located at 5468.8 eV, about 3.8 eV abovethe absorption edge of vanadium metal (5465.0 eV). This resultsuggests vanadium in natural sample is trivalent and occupies theoctahedral site of magnetite.
The lattice parameter a
0of M0 is 0.8394 nm while that of titano-
magnetite phase in M1, M2 and M3 are 0.8387 nm, 0.8384 nm and0.8397 nm, respectively. The lattice parameter a
0of titanomag-
netite is quite close to that of synthetic Fe 3O4, ascribed to the close
value of cationic radii for Ti4+(60 pm), V3+(64 pm) and displaced
Fe3+(65 pm) in the octahedral site [26,30,34] .
Calculated using the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of
M0, M1, M2 and M3 are 34 nm, 122 nm, 65 nm and 106 nm, respec-tively. This shows that the crystal sizes of natural samples are largerthan that of synthetic magnetite. Calculated by Kvalue method,
the contents of magnetite, titanomagnetite, ilmenite and chloritein four samples are listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that the titano-
magnetite content in these three natural samples increases fromM1 to M2 and then to M3.
3.1.2. Mössbauer spectroscopy
The Mössbauer spectra ( Fig. 5 ) and Mössbauer spectral param-
eters of M0 ( Table 2 ) indicate the formation of magnetite with
hyperﬁne ﬁeld ( B
hf) of 48.70 T (tetrahedral site A) and 45.36 T (octa-
hedral site B) and isomer shifts (IS) 0.331 mm s−1and 0.603 mm s−1,
respectively [35,36] . Also, a signal with Bhf50.22 T, IS 0.357 mm s−1
and the relative area of 10.2% suggests partial oxidation of mag-
netite to maghemite /H9253-Fe 2O3[37] .
For natural vanadium–titanium magnetite, the Mössbauer spec-
tra ( Fig. 5 ) and parameters ( Table 2 ) also show the typical spectra
of the cubic spinel structure, related to existence of titanomag-netite. Also, a signal with IS 1.07–1.10 mm s
−1and the relative area
of 12.4–16.9% is ascribed to the presence of ilmenite. However,the chlorite does not have Mössbauer signal, due to its low ironconcentration.

3.2. Catalytic activity
3.2.1. Effect of initial pH
In this study, the decolorization of Acid Orange II was attributed
to two aspects: on one hand, magnetites could act as catalyst in thenon-homogeneous Fenton reaction, generating
•OH radicals that
attacked the dye. On the other hand, the adsorption of the dye onthe catalyst surface led to a limiting color removal in this study.
Fig. 5. Mössbauer spectra of series of magnetites.The effect of initial solution pH on the decolorization rate of
Acid Orange II is shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that under differ-
ent pH, the adsorbed amount of the dye was quite low. Therefore,the decolorization of the dye was mainly dependent on degrada-tion. When the initial pH was 3.0, Acid Orange II could be quicklydegraded in 180 min under the adopted conditions. But as the initialpH rose, the degradation became much slower. After 360 min, thedecolorization rates of Acid Orange II with the initial pH at 4.0 and5.0 were 30% and 8%, respectively. The obtained results indicatedthat the increase of initial pH led to a much lower degradation rate.
It has been conﬁrmed that low pH promotes the stability of
hydrogen peroxide and slowed its decomposition [38] . Therefore,
the decrease of pH would slow the decomposition of H
2O2, which
may slow the decolorization process. However, in this study thedecrease of initial pH has led to a much larger degradation rate.The previous studies have approved that the degradation rate ofpollutants correlates to the adsorption behavior of pollutants onthe catalysts [29] . A larger adsorbed amount favors the degradation
of pollutants. In this study, the solution pH greatly inﬂuenced theadsorption through affecting the surface complexation reactionsand the electrostatic interactions between the dye and magnetite[39] . Since the point of zero charge (pH
pzc) of natural magnetite
was 6.8–8.0, the magnetite exhibited a positive zeta potential at pHvalues lower than pH
pzc, due to the formation of positive Fe–OH 2+
surface groups that increased as pH decreased [40] . On the other
hand, a p Ka1value of 1.0 for the –SO 3H group and a p Ka2value of
11.4 for the naphthalene of Acid Orange II, it could be conductedthat in the pH range studied most of the dye was negative charged

[41] . Therefore, lower pH could increase the electrostatic attrac-
tion between dye molecules and surfaces of adsorbents and favorthe adsorption reaction. With the decrease of pH, the increase ofadsorbed amount led to higher degradation rate. It is necessaryto mention that with decrease of pH in the solution, the amountof Fe leaching would increase, which speeds the production of
•OH through homogenous Fenton reaction. The contribution of
homogenous Fenton reaction to the whole decolorization processwould be discussed below. Moreover, in Fig. 6 all the decolorization
processes complied with pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate law.
3.2.2. Effect of catalyst dosage
As expected, Acid Orange II degradation rate increased as
the amount of employed catalyst increased ( Fig. 7 ), due to the
increasing active sites for H
2O2decomposition and dye adsorption.
Similarly, in Fig. 7 all the degradation processes catalyzed by the
changed amount of magnetite complied with pseudo-ﬁrst-orderrate law. However, the relationship between apparent pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant ( k
app) and catalyst amount did not show
a linear relationship, which may be ascribed to the competitionbetween the dye and H
2O2for the active sites on catalyst surface.
3.2.3. Effect of the hydrogen peroxide concentration
The effect of hydrogen peroxide was analyzed by varying its
initial concentration between 0 mmol L−1and 20 mmol L−1(Fig. 8 ).
According to the previous study, 42 mol of H 2O2are theoretically
needed for complete degradation of 1 mol of the dye [42] :
C16H11N2SO 4Na+42H 2O2→16CO 2+46H 2O+2HNO 3
+NaHSO 4 (1)
Based on this equation, the necessary amount of H 2O2in the
present study for complete degradation of 0.2 mmol L−1of Acid
Orange II is 8.4 mmol L−1. When the concentration of H 2O2was
5 mmol L−1, the degradation process was very slow due to lack
of adequate oxidant. As the concentration of H 2O2increased to
10 mmol L−1, the process was signiﬁcantly accelerated, for more
radicals were formed. When the H 2O2concentration increased to
15 mM, the rate constant did not increase greatly, due to the well-known hydroxyl radicals scavenging effect [42] :
H
2O2+•OH→ H2O+•O2H (2)
Such reaction reduced the amount of hydroxyl radicals and
caused the degradation rate to drop. Although another radical

(•O2H) was produced, its oxidation potential was much smaller
than that of the•OH species. Therefore, it made the reaction slow-
down through the rate constant still increased. However, when theH
2O2concentration increased to 20 mM, the rate constant turned to
obviously increase. From previous study [43] , the increase of H 2O2
dosage would increase the dissolved iron concentration under acid
condition and induce the homogeneous catalytic oxidation. It maybe the main reason for this phenomenon.
Otherwise, experiments were carried out in presence of mag-
netite or H
2O2alone ( Figs. 7 and 8 ). The result showed that H 2O2or
magnetite alone was not sufﬁcient for the degradation of this dye.
3.2.4. Degradation of Acid Orange II by series of magnetite
The decolorization processes of Acid Orange II using four sam-
ples as catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . Before the addition of H 2O2,
the decolorization of Acid Orange II only relied on adsorption. It canbe seen that the decolorization rate just by adsorption was quitelow, below 5%. After the addition of H
2O2, Acid Orange II could
be degraded through non-homogeneous Fenton reaction. 180 minlater, the decolorization rates of Acid Orange II by M0, M1, M2and M3 were 72%, 89%, 94% and 98%, respectively. Since the decol-orization rate of Acid Orange II just by adsorption was quite low,the decolorization of the dye mostly depended on the degradationprocess.

The degradation of Acid Orange II using magnetite as catalyst
corresponded to the•OH mechanism [44–46] .H 2O2was activated
by the cations on magnetite surface via a Haber–Weiss mechanismto form radical
•OH:
H2O2+S→•OH+OH−+S+(3)
In this equation, S and S+denote adsorption location and oxi-
dized location, respectively. It has been certiﬁed that Eq. (3) follows
pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic rate law [47] .
The degradation of the dye by•OH was typically described as a
second-order reaction:
dCt
dt=−kC[•OH] (4)
where Cand [•OH] are concentrations of Acid Orange II and
hydroxyl radical, respectively. kis the second-order rate constant,
and tis the reaction time. By assuming that•OH instantaneous
concentration was constant, the kinetics of dye degradation couldbe described according to the pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation as givenbelow [28] :
dC
t
dt=−kappCt (5)
kapp=k[•OH] (6)
−ln(Ct/C 0)=kappt (7)
where C0is the initial concentration of Acid Orange II and kapp is the
apparent pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant (min−1). The kapp con-
stants were obtained from the slopes of the straight lines by plotting−ln(C
t/C0) as a function of time t, through regression [48] . Good
correlation coefﬁcients ( r2> 0.98) were obtained in our systems
(Figs. 6–9 ).
The apparent pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant kapp for M0,
M1, M2 and M3 are 0.0071 min−1, 0.012 min−1, 0.016 min−1and
0.019 min−1, respectively. It can be seen that the catalytic activity of
natural vanadium–titanium magnetite is stronger than that of syn-thetic magnetite Fe
3O4. It is quite interesting that catalytic activity
of pure magnetite is inferior to that of natural magnetite, althoughthe content of titanomagnetite in natural samples is just 66–76%.The higher catalytic activity of natural magnetite is related to thepresence of titanium and vanadium in the magnetite. Previousresearches have revealed that transition metal cations (e.g. Mn
2+,
Cr3+and Co2+) replacing the ferrous and ferric ions in magnetite
can improve the catalytic activity of magnetite in heterogeneousFenton reactions, by activating H
2O2to produce•OH and accel-
erating the electron transfer during the reaction [14,19,49,50] .I t
also explains the effect of titanium and vanadium on the catalyticactivity of natural titanium–vanadium magnetite.
The correlation of k
app with the content of three minerals in
natural samples is shown in Fig. 10 . The constant kapp increases
remarkably with the increase of titanomagnetite content in the nat-ural samples. The correlation of k
app with titanomagnetite content
approximately matches a nice linear ﬁt ( r2= 0.999). On the con-
trary, the correlations of kapp with the content of other minerals
in natural samples do not show good relationship. Moreover, sincetitanomagnetite is the main mineral in natural vanadium–titaniummagnetite, this implies that titanomagnetite would be the mostactive ingredient in catalytic experiment.
When the solution pH value is above 4.0, the amount of dissolved
iron is so low that the effect of homogeneous Fenton reaction on thedegradation process can be neglected [51] . In this study, the initial
solution pH was 3.0. Therefore, under this condition, the contribu-tion of homogeneous Fenton reaction catalyzed by dissolved ironto the whole degradation process may be quite important to thereaction mechanism. Hence, a special experiment was conductedas described in the Section 2, to investigate the contribution from

the homogeneous Fenton reaction. When the non-homogeneous
Fenton reaction ﬁnished, the pH of the solution was 2.88–2.96,related to the presence of some degradation products. The homoge-neous Fenton reaction catalyzed by the dissolved iron is shown inFig. 11 . The decolorization rate of Acid Orange II through homoge-
neous Fenton reaction was below 10% after 180 min. Thus, it couldbe observed that the effect of homogeneous Fenton reaction onthe degradation process can be neglected. The whole decompo-sition of Acid Orange II by natural magnetite was dominated byheterogeneous Fenton reaction.
3.2.5. The mineralization process of Acid Orange II
To investigate the mineralization during the degradation of Acid
Orange II by natural samples in the presence of H
2O2, the min-
eralization process in the reaction system catalyzed by M3 wererecorded as shown in Fig. 12 . Mineralization rate is the percentage
of organic compound transformed to inorganic compound, calcu-lated as below:
Mineralization rate =(T
0−Tt)×100%
T0
where T0and Ttare the initial TOC concentration and instantaneous
TOC concentration, respectively.
From Fig. 12 , the mineralization of Acid Orange II was much
slower than its decolorization. Four hours after the reaction started,

presence of H 2O2(C0= 0.2 mmol L−1, 10 mmol L−1of H 2O2, 1 . 0gL−1of M3, 200 mL,
pH = 3.0, 25◦C).
the mineralization rate of Acid Orange II was about 30%. But at the
same time the decolorization of Acid Orange II was nearly 100%. Soit could be inferred that some achromatic medium products wasmade during the degradation process.
In order to investigate the degradation products, the temporal
evolution of UV–vis spectra recorded during the decolorization ofAcid Orange II by M3 in the presence of H
2O2is shown in Fig. 13 . The
decrease in intensity of the peaks at 200 nm is related to the decom-position of H
2O2. And Acid Orange II has ﬁve absorption peaks in
which two peaks in visible region and three in ultraviolet region.In visible region, a major peak locates at 484 nm and a shoulderpeak locates at 430 nm due to the hydrazone form and azo formof Acid Orange II, respectively. The other three peaks in ultravioletregion are assigned to the aromatic ring, among which the peaks at228 nm and 310 nm in ultraviolet region are ascribed to the benzeneand naphthalene rings of the dye, respectively. The results showthat the intensity of the 484 nm and the 430 nm absorption peaksdecreased rapidly with the reaction proceeding, indicating that the
•OH radical ﬁrstly attacked azo groups and destructed the N N
bond [52,53] . And the intensity of the 310 nm and 228 nm absorp-
tion peaks, related to the naphthyl and benzene, respectively [54] ,
gradually decreased, which could be inferred that these two ringwere gradually broken. It conﬁrms the fact that N
N bond is eas-
ier to be destructed than aromatic rang structure and also explainswhy mineralization of Acid Orange II was much slower than itsdecolorization. Moreover, no new absorption peaks appeared.

function of reaction time ( C0= 0.2 mmol L−1, 10 mmol L−1of H 2O2, 1 . 0gL−1of M3,
200 mL, pH = 3.0, 25◦C).
Fig. 14. Near-infrared diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy of Acid Orange II and its
degradation products in the solution.
The content of degradation product has also been analyzed
by near-infrared diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy ( Fig. 14 ). The
bands located at 1600–1450 cm−1(aromatic C C stretching),
1623 cm−1(C N stretching), 1508 cm−1(N–H bending), 1452 cm−1
(N–N stretching), 1000–1250 cm−1(S–O stretching and aromatic
C–H bending), respectively represent the characteristic absorp-
tion peaks of Acid Orange II in the infrared region [39] . After
degradation, most of these bands greatly lessened in intensity ordisappeared, indicating that drastic destruction happened. How-ever, some bands did not disappeared, related to the uncompleteddestruction of some aromatic group and inadequate mineralization,which well corresponds to the TOC result.
3.2.6. The stability of natural magnetite catalyst
Stability is an important property for effective catalyst. The sta-
bility of M3 (the most active catalyst in this study) was investigatedby recycle experiment. After each recycling, the catalyst was treatedby centrifugation, dried and reused. From Fig. 15 , it can be found
that the catalytic activity of M3 was still strong after three cycles.The decolorization rates of the dye were 98%, 93% and 90% after180 min for cycle 1, 2 and 3, respectively. All three cycles com-plied with the pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate law. It indicates that thenatural vanadium–titanium magnetite has a good long-term sta-

bility and activity. The small decrease of catalytic activity was due
to dissolution of iron in natural magnetite.
4. Conclusion
The natural vanadium–titanium magnetite puriﬁed by magnetic
separation mainly contains titanomagnetite, with a small amountof ilmenite and chlorite. Titanomagnetite is doped with vanadium,whose valency is mainly +3.
The decolorization of Acid Orange II mainly depended on degra-
dation. Decreasing pH in acid range and increasing catalyst andhydrogen peroxide could accelerate the degradation. The pres-ence of titanium and vanadium in magnetite greatly improvedthe catalytic activity of natural magnetite for the Acid OrangeII decolorization. The whole decolorization process followedpseudo-ﬁrst-order rate law, dominated by the heterogeneous Fen-ton reaction. The apparent pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant k
app
increased with the increase of the titanomagnetite content. Dur-
ing the degradation process, the naphthyl and benzene aromaticrings of Acid Orange II were gradually broken. The mineralizationrate was about 30% 4 h after the degradation started. The naturalvanadium–titanium magnetite has a good activity and stability.
