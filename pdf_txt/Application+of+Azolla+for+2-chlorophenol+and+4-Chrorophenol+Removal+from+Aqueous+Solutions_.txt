Abstract  
 
Background and purpose: The 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP) and 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) are phenolic 
compounds which they may have adverse effects on human and environment. Therefore, the 
removal of these compounds is necessary from water and wastewater. The aim of thi s study was 
the investigation of 2 -CP and 4 -CP removal by using Azolla filiculoides biomass.  
Materials and Methods:  The Azolla biomass was sun dried , crushed and sieved to particle sizes 
in range of 1 -2 mm. Then treated with 0.1M HCl for 5h followed by wa shing with distilled water 
and it used as adsorbent. The residues concentration of 2 -CP and 4 -CP was measured by 
spectrophotometer in λ max of 274 and 280 nm, respectively.   
Results:  The solute removed increased with increasing of contact time. The equilibr ium time for 
2-CP and 4 -CP is 90 and 75, respectively. The removal efficiency of 4 -CP is more than 2 -CP. 
An increase in initial concentration of both compounds can lead to decrease the removal 
efficiency of them. The optimum pH to remove the both compound is 5. The equilibrium data is 
best fitted on Langmuir isotherm and the adsorption kinetic model follows pseudo -second 
model.  
Conclusion:  The results indicated that Azolla is an effective adsorbent for 2 -CP and 4 -CP 
removal from water and wastewater . [Zazouli MA. *Balarak D.  Mahdavi Y.  Application of Azolla

 1. Introduction  
    Chlorophenols are an important 
class of aromatic pollutants in 
industrial wastewaters and belong to 
a group of common environmental 
contaminants (1). Chlorophenols (CP) 
are widely found in the environment, 
for example during the chlorination 
of drinking water in municipal water 
treatment facilities; as by chlorine 
bleaching in numerous industries; as 
discharge from a range of 
incineration processes; and as 
common constituents of herbicides 
and pesticides on agricultural 
land. (2). Due to their toxicity and 
adverse effect upon human, the 
United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), has 
classified them as priority 
pollutants (3, 4) .  
   Chlorophenols are used extensively 
in the manufacture of fungicides, 
herbicides, insecticides, 
pharmaceuticals, preservatives, glue, 
paint, fibers, leather, and as 
intermediates in chemical 
synthesis (5). Because of high 
toxicity, carcinogenicity, yet poor 
biodegradability, chlorophenols are 
among the priority contam inants of 
major environmental concern. 
Therefore it is desirable to develop 
efficient processes for the removal of 
these compounds from waste 
waters (6). Numerous approaches, 
including physic al, chemical, and biological processes, for the removal 
of phenols and phenolic compounds 
from industrial waste effluents have 
been employed. The traditional 
methods such as adsorption, chemical 
oxidation, precipitation, distillation, 
solvent extraction, i on exchange, 
membrane processes, and reverse 
osmosis, etc. have been widely used 
for removal of phenols from aqueous 
solutions (7-9). Among them, removal 
of phenols by adsorption is the most 
powerful separation and purification 
method because this technique has 
significant advantages incl uding high 
efficiency, easy handling, high 
selectivity, lower operating cost, easy 
regeneration of adsorbent, and 
minimized the production of 
chemical or biological sludge(8).  
   Adsorption process is strongly 
affected by the chemistry and surface 
morphol ogy of the adsorbent. 
Therefore, new adsorbents, which are 
economical, easily available, having 
strong affinity and high loading 
capacity, have been required. A 
number of adsorbents such as 
activated carbon, red mud, rubber 
seed coat and etc. have been use d for 
Phenolic compounds (10-13).  
Activated carbon is commonly used 
to remove organic compounds from 
industrial effluents because of its high 
removal efficiency.  However, the 
cost associated with using activated 
carbon is relatively high and is not

 applicable to industrial effluents 
containing low concentrations of 
contaminants (14-16). Hence, many 
cheap alternative adsorbents have 
been tested to remove org anic 
compounds from industrial effluents. 
Recently much attention has been 
focused on the use of biosorbent 
materials, such as fungal or bacterial 
biomass, and natural biopolymers, 
including peat, wheat shells, fly ash, 
wood sawdust and dried algal 
biomass , for the removal of material 
(17-19). Azolla, a floating water fern, 
grows quickly over the water surfa ce, 
forming a dense mat, and therefore 
poses many negative effects to 
aquatic ecology (20, 21) . However, 
using Azolla as a bioabsorbent to 
remove phenol from the industrial 
effluents would be a “win –win” 
solution for both environmental 
problems as it would be effective in 
phenol  compounds removal and an 
essentially noxious weed would find 
an alternative use as remediation 
material. Recently, non living Azolla 
has been used as a potential 
biosorbent for the treatment of metal -
bearing efflu ents (22-24). 
   However, a few reports have also 
suggested that Azolla is capable of 
removing dyes (25-27) and phenol 
compounds (20) from aqueous 
solutions. In this study, dried Azolla 
Filiculoides was used as a biosorbent 
to remove 2 -Chlorophenol and 4 -Chrorophenol as a target pollutant 
from aqueous solution. The aim of 
this research was to study application 
of Azolla Filiculoides biomass for 2 -
Chlorophenol and 4 -Chrorophenol 
Removal fr om aqueous solutions 
using batch experiments under 
different experimental conditions, 
including pH, biosorbent dosage, 
contact time, temperature and initial 
2-Chlorophenol and 4 -Chrorophenol 
concentrations.  
 
 2. Materials and Methods  
 1.2. Adsorbent preparation   
   Azolla filiculoides was collected 
from rice paddy in Sari County; then 
it was dried in the sunlight, and was 
crushed and sieved to particle sizes in 
the range of 1 –2 mm. The biomass 
was treated with 0.1 M HCl for a 
period of 5 h and it was washed with 
distilled water and finally was dried 
in the shade (20). The resultant 
biomass was subsequently used in 
sorption experiments.  
  
2.2. Material   
The 2 -CP and 4 -CP was purchased 
from Merck Co. The desired 
concentration of 2 -Chlorophenol and 
4-Chrorophenol solution was 
prepared by dilution of stock solution 
(1000mg/l). The general 
characteristics and chemical 
structures of 2 -Chlorophenol and 4 -
Chrorophenol are present ed in 
table1and Fig1, respectively.

3.2. Batch adsorption experiments            
The literature review indicated that the 
most important effective variables on 
adsorption are including pH, adsorbent 
dose, and contact  time and pollutants  
concentrations. Therefore, the initial 2-
CP 4 ،-CP concentrations was selected 
(10, 25, 50, 100, 200 mg/l). the effect of  
absorbent dosage(0.2 -1.4g),contact time 
(10,20,30,45,60,75 , 90, 120,180,  240 
min) and pH (3, 5, 7, 9, 11) were 
investigated (30). The experiments in 
batch system were carried out in a 250 
ml Erlenmeyer flask Meyer. In each 
adsorption experiment, certain with 
certain concentration of 2 -Chlorophenol ،4-Chrorophenol solution were added 
into the flask. The desired condition was 
adjusted a nd then the specific dose of 
adsorbent was added. Studied samples 
were mixed with shaker at 180 rpm for 
60 minutes. Then the samples were 
centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min. 
Finally, the residual concentrations were 
measured using uv -visible in λ max of 274  
and 280nm for 2-CP4and  –CP 
respectively. The amount of adsorbed 2-
CP and 4 -CP was calculated according to 
the following equation1 (31).

(mg/g), C 0 and C e are the initial and 
equilibrium concentrations of liquid 
phase (mg/L), V is the volume of the 
solution (L), and m is the mass of the 
adsorbent.  
 
4.2. Adsorption isotherms  
   The equilibrium adsorption isotherm is 
importance in the design of adsorption 
systems. Although several isotherm 
equations are available , two important 
isotherms were selected in this study the 
Langmuir, Freundlich isotherms. The 
Langmuir isotherm is the equation2 (33).

  Where q e is the amount of sorbate 
biosorbed at equilibrium (mg/g); C e is 
the equilibrium concentration of the 
sorbate or the sorbate unadsorbed in the 
solution (mg/L); q m (mg/g) is the 
maximum theoretical biosorption 
capacity and K L (L/mg) is a measure of 
biosorption energy, indicating the 
affinity between biosorbent and sorbate.  
The Freundlich equation is given by the 
following equation3 (3, 32) .

   where q e is the sorbate biosorbed at the 
equilibrium (mg/g); C e is the equilibrium 
concentration of the sorbate or the 
unabsorbed sorbate in the solution 
(mg/L); KF  is a constant, indicative of 
biosorption capacity (33).     Fig shows the Freundlich and 
Langmuir equation obtained for the 
biosorption of 2-Chlorophenol and 4 -
Chrorophenol  onto dried A. filiculoides.  
 
5.2. Adsorption kinetics   
   Kinetic models are used to examine the 
rate of the adsorption process and 
potential rate controlling step. In the 
present work, the kinetic data obtained 
from batch studies have been analyzed 
by using pseudo second -order, pseudo 
First-order model.  The pseu do-first-order 
rate equation is expressed as equation 4 
(31). 
 Log (q e − q) = log q e − k1t
2.3                              (4)  
 
   Where qe and q are the amounts of 2 -
CP and 4 -CP adsorbed (mg/g) at 
equilibrium and at time t (min), 
respectively, and k1 the rate constant of 
adsorption (min −1). Values of k1 were 
calculated from the plots of log (qe − q) 
versus t for different concentrations.  The 
pseudo -second -order rate equation is 
expressed as equation5 (34).

   Where K2 is the rate constant of 
pseudo -second -order sorption (g mg

solute sorbed at any time and at 
equilibrium (mg/g) respectively. The

    If the second -order kinetic equation is 
applicable, the plot of t/q against t of Eq 
(6) should give a linear relationship. The  
qe and K 2 can be determined from the 
slope and the intercept of the plot.   
 
3. Results   
 1.3. Effect of  contact time    
   The adsorption rate of 4 -CP and 2 -CP 
increased by increasing the contact time, however the equilibrium point  was 
reached 15 minute earlier for 4-CP. The 
optimum contact time for 4 -CP and 2 -CP 
was obtained in 75 and 90 min, 
respectively; although there was no 
significant difference in 75 and 90 min 
for 2 -CP. The effect of contact tim e on 
removal efficiency of each compound is 
presented in Fig2.

2.3. Effect of pH and adsorbent 
dosage . 
   The Fig 3&4 are shown the effect of 
pH and adsorbent dosage on adsorption 
rate. As can be observed , the maximum 
removal efficiency was occurred in 
acidic pH. Adsorption rate is not 
significant difference in acidic pH, so 
that there is only 3% difference in 
adsorption efficiency in pH of 3 and 5 
and the optimum pH is 5. However, the 
adsorption efficiency  decreased rapidly with increasing of the pH from acidic to 
alkali ranges.  The adsorption efficiency 
increased by increasing of the adsorbent 
dose up to10gr/l and 12gr/l for 4-CP and 
2-CP, respectively. It reaches to 
equilibrium after those doses. Althoug h 
the adsorption efficiency increases by 
increasing in adsorbent dose, however 
the adsorption rate per gr of adsorbent 
dose (q e)decreases.

4. Discussion   
   With regarding the results, the 4-CP, 2 -
CP removal efficiency increased by 
increasing of contact time which it is due 
to more contact between pollutants and 
adsorbent. In the initial minutes the 4 -
CP, 2 -CP was rapidly adsorpted. 
Adsorption decreased with time which it can be due to decli ning of 4 -CP, 2 -CP 
concentration and decreasing of active 
points on adsorbent surface area. In the 
early stages of adsorption, there are a lot 
of empty spaces and they are occupied 
by 4 -CP, 2 -CP molecules with time 
which it is consistent with several studi es 
that they conducted 
on Phenolic compounds  removal by 
several adsorbents (31, 35) . The 
adsorption rate of 4 -CP is 20% more than 
2-CP. one of the most important factors 
affecting the biosorption of CP on dried 
A. filiculoides was the acidity of the 
solution. The pH of the solution 
influences not only the surface charge of 
the biosorbent and the dissociation of 
functional groups of the active sites on 
the surface of the biosorbent, but also the 
aqueous chemistry of the CP.              The difference adsorption rate for 2 -
chlorophenol and 4 -chlorophenol 
depends on different solubility of t hese 
compound which due to the position of 
chlorine on ring of 2 -CP that can lead to 
more stability against ionization and the 
less solubility of 2 -CP. The percent 
removal decreased with increasing in pH.

   (Where CP0 is the concentration of 
unionized CP species, CPT is the total 
concentration of CP taken, pH 
(equilibrium pH) after adsorption and 
pKa is (8.35), the concentrations of 
ionized CP species (chlorophenolate) 
were calculated. Equation7 expressed 
that the number of ionized CP is 
decreased by an increasing in pH and it 
can lead to reduce the adsorption 
efficiency (36). This is implied in the 
study on 2 -CP removal by low -cost 
adsorbent whi ch is conducted by

adsorption efficiency decreased by 
increasing of initial concentration of 
phenol compound, however the 
adsorption capacity increased (30). This 
probably occurs due to that by increasing 
of the surface charge on the adsorbent, 
the adsorption sites of top surfaces of 
adsorbent are saturated and the removal 
efficiency decreased. The reason of the 
rising t he adsorption capacity by 
increasing the initial phenolic compound 
concentrations is due to the increasing of 
collusion and contact  between adsorbent 
and adsorbate (30). It is consistent with 
other conducted studies (3, 13). The 
adsorption rate increased by increasing 
of adsorbent dose which it is due to 
increasing of the active surface of 
adsorbent. The results showed that 
although efficiency increased wi th 
increasing adsorbent dose, however the 
4-CP, 2 -CP adsorbed per gram of 
adsorbent decreased because the active 
sites of adsorbent are not saturated. 
increasing of adsorbent dose, the total 
capacity of the adsorbent surface points 
not used completely and this reduces the 
absorption rate per unit mass of the 
adsorbent (11). Lower biosorption capacity of CP at a higher dosage of 
biosorbent is probably due to the 
decrease of the surface area of the 
biosorbent by the overlapping or 
aggregation during the sorption (18). The 
R2 of kinetic models suggested that the 
pseudo second -order model mechanism 
is predominant. It means the uptake 
process follows the pseudo -second -order 
expression with Correlation coef ficients 
were always greater of 0.99 . The lowest 
correlation coefficient in pseudo second - 
order model was better than the first 
order model correlation coefficients    
(31, 34, 37 - 39). The Freundlich equation 
is based on the hypothesis of multi -layer 
biosorption. Langmuir isotherm assumes 
monolayer coverage of a sorbate on to 
the solid surface of adsorbent, uniform 
energy of sorption, and no transmigration 
of sorbate in the plane  of the surface. the 
correlation  coefficient (R2)  for Langmuir 
equation always greater than 0.99 , which 
was slightly more than the R2 value 
obtained from the Freundlich equation 
indicating that  the Langmuir model 
better fitted the equilibrium obtained in 
this study (5, 8, 35) . Conclusion : The 
present study shows that the Azolla 
Filiculoides is an effective adsorbent for 
the removal  of 2 -CP and 4 -CP from 
aqueous solutions. Adsorption 
equilibrium follows Langmuir  isotherm. 
Kinetics of adsorption follows second -
order model. The complete remov al of 
phenolic compounds from wastewater  
can be achieved by using appropriate 
dosage of the adsorbent , pH and contact 
time from wastewater .
