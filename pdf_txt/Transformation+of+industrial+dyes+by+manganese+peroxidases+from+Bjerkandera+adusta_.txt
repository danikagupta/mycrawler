Abstract
A versatile peroxidase, puriﬁed from a novel strain of Bjerkandera sp. (B33/3), was tested for its reactivity on a lignin fraction obtained
from straw pulping. The effects of such processing parameters as reaction time, pH, and lignin:enzyme ratio were evaluated. Gel ﬁltration
chromatography was employed to characterise the molecular mass distribution of the lignin fragments produced by the enzyme-mediated
reaction. Our results have shown that such a versatile peroxidase can directly bring about transformations of lignin, even in the absence
of external mediators.

Introduction
Attention has recently been paid to a novel class of
ligninolytic peroxidases, versatile peroxidases, which com-
bine typical properties of both manganese and lignin
peroxidases, coupled with a broad substrate range ( Ruiz-
Duenas et al., 1999 ;Camarero et al., 2000 ;Martinez, 2002 ).
Such a new class of enzymes has high afﬁnity for
manganese and dyes, but is also able to oxidise 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (DMP) and veratryl alcohol (VA) in a
manganese-independent reaction ( Martinez, 2002 ). Unlike
manganese peroxidases that are only able to oxidise
phenolic substrates in the presence of manganese, versatile
peroxidases are able to oxidise such compounds both in
manganese dependent and independent reactions.
Versatile peroxidases have also raised a great deal of
interest in the biotechnology ﬁeld, because they do not
seem to require any mediators for substrate oxidation.
Most studies to date pertaining to versatile enzymes have
focused on characterisation of their oxidation abilitytoward several model compounds; however, little effort
has been devoted to demonstrate the activity of the
members of this enzyme group on what is thought to be
one of its natural substrates, i.e., lignin. There is little data
available relating to oxidation of lignin (or lignin-
derivatives) by versatile peroxidases. A recent communica-
tion ( Moreira et al., 2001a ) has reported results of the ﬁrst
in vitro testing of a versatile peroxidase from Bjerkandera
sp. strain BOS55, in biobleaching of a eucalyptus kraft
pulp; those authors acknowledged a 6% reduction in the
pulp kappa number, but no further assessment was carried
out. This study calls attention to the potential use of
versatile peroxidases for applications in the pulp and paper
industry, namely modiﬁcation of lignins.
The presence of lignin, or lignin products resulting from
various pulping and bleaching operations in pulp and paper
industries, is responsible for the brownish colour of their
efﬂuents, which can cause environmental problems; although
colour is considered a nonconventional discharge parameter,
several countries have already limited colour levels in
discharge efﬂuents via strict environmental legislation.
Versatile peroxidases have to date been isolated only

strain BOS55 ( Camarero et al., 1996, 1999, 2000 ;Heinﬂing
et al., 1998a, b, c ;Mester and Field, 1998 ;Ruiz-Duenas
et al., 1999, 2001 ;Giardina et al., 2000 ). Their pH optima
for oxidation of Mn(II) (pH 5.0) and aromatic compounds
and dyes (pH 3.0) are quite different, but are similar to the
optima of MnP and LiP activities. Pleurotus eryngii
produces two versatile peroxidase isoenzymes (PS1 and
MnPL1), which can be isolated from distinct culture media
(Camarero et al., 1999 ;Ruiz-Duenas et al., 1999 ). PS1
presents similar activities on Mn(II), DMP, and methoxy- p-
hydroquinone, but lower than MnPL1 on VA, p-methox-
ybenzene, and lignin model dimers, hence suggesting a lower
redox potential ( Ruiz-Duenas et al., 2001 ). The catalytic
properties of Pleurotus and Bjerkandera sp. versatile
peroxidases are similar to each other ( Martinez, 2002 ).
During a selection program aimed at isolating new
potential lignin degraders, one of the most promising
strains, tentatively named B33/3, was further tested and
consequently identiﬁed as a member of the Bjerkandera
genus. Further investigation provided a detailed character-
ization of B33/3 ligninolytic enzymes, leading to descrip-
tion and molecular characterisation of a novel versatile
peroxidase in this genus ( Moreira et al., 2001b, 2005, 2006 ).
The direct interaction of the enzyme with natural lignin
molecules remains to be demonstrated.
In this research, sulphur-free lignin obtained from a soda
straw pulping process was used as substrate for biotrans-
formation studies. Lignin in solution was made to react
with the versatile peroxidase, previously isolated from
Bjerkandera sp. (B33/3), in the absence of any external
mediators. Gel ﬁltration was used to follow the evolution
in molecular mass distribution of lignin ( Zimmerman et al.,
1988). The effects of the prevailing reaction conditions
upon the decolourisation processes were studied.
Sulphur-free lignin was obtained from Granit SA (Lausanne, Switzer-
land). A versatile peroxidase (named RBP) from a Bjerkandera sp. strain
was puriﬁed, as described elsewhere ( Moreira et al., 2006 ).
Standard 2

full factorial design methodology was used to evaluate
the effect of some important parameters on RBP reactions, as detailed in
Table 1 . The parameters tested were reaction time, initial reaction pH, and
lignin:enzyme ratio. Duplicates (i.e., replicates run under the same
experimental conditions) were obtained for half of the experiments, and
used to estimate the standard error of the overall mean and associated with
each major and interaction effects. Signiﬁcance was set at the 0.05 conﬁdence
level, using Fisher’s distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using the
experimental design module of the STATISTICA v. 5.5 software.
In a typical experiment, the pH of a lignin preparation (0.005 g
solubilized in 100 mM NaOH) was adjusted to the intended value(4.0 or 5.3) with 100 mM sodium tartrate buffer; the appropriate amount
of RBP was then added to reach the desired lignin:enzyme ratio (800:1 or
1500:1). The ﬁnal volume (5 mL) of the assay aliquot was made up with
the same buffer. The reaction was started with addition of 0.05 mL of
20 mM hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was conducted at 30 1C, under
stirring at 90 rpm, for the appropriate period (2.0 or 4.0 h), during which
0.05 mL of 20 mM hydrogen peroxide was added every 60 min. At the end
of the reaction, the medium was ﬁltered through Whatman no. 1
(Middlesex, UK) ﬁlter paper and the supernatant taken for analysis.
Controls were done at the two pH values tested (4.0 and 5.3), in the
presence and absence of the denatured enzyme. The enzyme was denatured
by heating to 106 1C for 10 min. No difference in the decolourisation
reaction was observed in the absence or presence of the denatured enzyme.
Following the experimental design methodology, 12 runs (8 different
conditions and 4 replicas) were carried out (see Table 2 ) and analysed
against the controls.
The reaction of lignin, as catalysed by our enzyme, was quantiﬁed via
decrease in the true colour of samples (20-fold diluted in 100 mM NaOH),
determined at 455 nm using a DR/1020 colorimeter (Hach, Loveland, OH,
USA). This method, also employed routinely in the pulp and paper
industries to measure the true colour of efﬂuents containing lignin in
APHA Pt–Co colour units, was performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The apparent reaction yield was calculated based on
decolourisation of reaction samples, with reference to control samples.
The molecular mass distribution of the soluble fragments of lignin
(which is correlated with the true colour of the sample) was determined by
gel ﬁltration chromatography in a 40 /C22.5-cm Sephadex G-100 column
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA); elution was at 0.5 mL min
/C01
, using
100 mM NaOH (pH 13) as eluant; the efﬂuent was monitored spectro-
photometrically at 280 nm. The gel ﬁltration system was calibrated with

Results
The experimental results are presented in Table 2 ,i n
terms of decolourisation yields. Estimated standard errors
were employed to assess the signiﬁcance level of the effect
associated with each processing parameter. The results of
the statistical analysis are depicted in Table 3 . Changes
were observed in the response of the dependent variable
(decolourisation yield) as variable conditions (reaction
time, pH, and lignin:enzyme ratio) changed from level /C01
to level +1. The main effect values depicted in Table 3
show that the increase in pH from level /C01 to level +1
caused an estimated decrease in decolourisation yield
(dependent variable) of ca. 49.8. Unlike pH, changes in
the other two processing parameters (reaction time and
lignin:enzyme ratio) from level /C01 to level +1 produced an
estimated increase in the decolourisation yield of ca. 12.9
and 20.6, respectively. Interactions between each two of the
three variables tested are relevant, though estimated effects
(increases between 7.4 and 9.5) were much lower when
compared to effects of each processing variable indepen-
dently, as reported previously.
A gel ﬁltration chromatography was performed with the
objective of evaluating the molecular weight distribution of
soluble lignins resulting from the enzymatic reactions. The
results of gel ﬁltration chromatography of the lignin
solution, obtained from the set of experimental conditions
that yielded higher decolourisation, as well as a control
sample, are presented in Fig. 1 . From the analysis of the
chromatogram it is possible to distinguish a notable changein the molecular weight distribution of soluble lignin, a
strong indication that these changes are dependent on
enzymatic reactions (in optimal conditions).
Discussion
Lignin transformations brought about by this versatile
peroxidase were detected and quantiﬁed by measuring
changes in the true colour of the system solution. The
enzyme may catalyse polymerisation, chromophore altera-
tion, or breakdown of lignin molecules. Although all those
three reactions may occur, polymerisation reactions lead-
ing to precipitation should contribute more for higher
decolourisation of samples. The polymerisation of soluble
lignin fragments, mostly those of higher molecular weight,
as suggested by the gel ﬁltration chromatography analysis,
produces high-molecular-mass lignin molecules, which
form colloidal particles that tend to precipitate even at
high pH. Formation of a (brown) precipitate leads to
removal of high-molecular-mass lignins from solution,
hence reducing its true colour, as suggested elsewhere
(Guerra et al., 2000 ).
In the experimental design used, all variables affected the
reaction response ( Table 3 ); however, the strongest effect
was associated with pH: The higher the pH, the lower the
decolourisation extent. This effect can be explained in two
ways: (i) the optimum pH for oxidation of lignin by RBP is
on the acidic side, as with the oxidation of VA ( Moreira et
al., 2006 ); and (ii) lignin has a lower solubility at acidic pH,
so macromolecules formed by putative polymerisation will
precipitate earlier at a lower pH. The relative amounts of
lignin and enzyme affected the reaction responses as well;
an increase in the amount of enzyme added per unit
substrate led to a decrease in the decolourisation yield. This
result cannot be easily explained, as the opposite should be
expected; however, it may be that the higher enzyme/
protein ratio contributes to stabilise the soluble (contribut-
ing to colloidal particle formation) and/or also contributes

increasing the resolubilisation of the polymerised fractions.
It is also well known that heterogeneous enzymatic
catalysis is not a linear function of the enzyme concentra-
tion per unit of substrates, as in the case of, for example,
lipases ( Duarte, 1982 ). Further evaluation of this effect is
needed. Reaction time also affected the reaction extent,
hence emphasising the slow and non-equilibrium nature of
the reactions; the reaction would likely be carried out
further if more time was allowed. Signiﬁcant interactions
between variables seem to occur in this system ( Table 3 ),
which is also expected due to the heterogeneous nature of
the reaction system, as well as physical and biochemical
changes that might occur in the reaction medium. Further
studies are needed to fully clarify the mechanistic basis of
this complex system, although reactivity is almost certainly
due to the generation of free radicals by the enzyme from
lignin.
This mechanism is also suggested from inspection of
Fig. 1 , where it is possible to observe a strong reduction of
the high- and intermediate-molecular-mass fractions of the
soluble lignin fraction (which might be due to the free
radical induced polymerisation reaction, responsible for
the brown precipitate observed) and an increase (although
smaller) of the lower-molecular-mass fraction of lignin in
solution, hence conﬁrming the presence of degradation
products, most likely produced by enzymatically catalysed
oxidative reactions. Hofrichter et al. (2001) have also
reported that enzymatic attack by a MnP enzyme from
Phlebia radiata on milled pine wood resulted in polymer-
isation of lower-molecular-mass soluble wood components,
as well as partial depolymerisation of the insoluble bulk of
pine wood. These results are in agreement with those
obtained in our present research, but differ in that, unlike
MnP, this versatile peroxidase does not require manganese
for effective action. Complementary studies on lignin
molecular structure in various fractions, although of great
complexity, should contribute to the clariﬁcation of the
enzymatic reaction mechanisms involved in polymerisation
and degradation.
Conclusions
Our results have shown, for the ﬁrst time, that a versatile
peroxidase (RBP) is able to react with soluble lignin
fragments in the absence of added mediators, most
probably causing extensive polymerisation of high and
intermediate fractions of lignin, and an increase of the
small-molecular-mass lignin fraction (probably due to
degradation). The results also show that Bjerkandera sp.
B33/3 versatile peroxidase may be of interest for use in
pulp and paper industries.
