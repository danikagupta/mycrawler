 ABSTRACT  
The e ver-increasing demands for clean and sustainable energy sources combined with rapid 
advances in bio -integrated portable or implantable electronic devices have stimulated 
intensive research activities in enzymatic (bio)fuel cells ( EFCs). The use of renewable 
biocatalysts, the utili zation of abundant green, safe, and high energy density fuels, together 
with the capability of working at modest and biocompatible conditions, make EFCs promising 
as next generation alternative power sources.  However, the main challenges (low energy 
density, relatively low power density, poor operational stability and limited voltage output)  
hinder  future applications of EFCs. This review aims at exploring the underlying mechanism 
of EFCs and providing possible practical strategies, methodologies and insights to tackle of 
these  issue s. Firstly, this review  summarize s approaches in achieving high energy densities in 
EFCs, particular ly, employing enzyme cascades for the deep/complete oxidation of  fuels. 
Secondly , strategies for increasing power densit ies in EFCs, including increasing enzyme 
activities, facilitating electron transfer s, employing nanomaterials , and designing  more 
efficient  enzyme -electrode interfaces , are described . The potential of EFCs/(super)capacitor 
combination  is discussed . Thirdly, the review evaluates a range of strategies for improving the 
stability of EFCs, including the use of  different enzyme immobilization approaches, tuning 
enzyme properties , designing p rotective matrixes,  and using microbial surface displaying 
enzymes. Fourthly, approaches for the improvement of the cell voltage of EFCs are 
highlighted . Finally, f uture development s and a prospective on EFCs are envisioned.

 1. Introduction  
1.1 Enzymatic (bio)fuel cell s (EFC s), general considerations  
The uneven geographic al distribution of fuels  associated with the increasingly serious effects 
of environmental  pollution provides the driving force for the pursuit of green  and sustainable 
energy source s. To this end, fuel cells are  considered environmentally friendly 
electrochemical devices  to directly co nvert chemical energy into electrical energy  without 
intermediate steps .1 In general, conventional fuel cells use noble metals ( e.g. platinum, 
ruthenium , palladium , etc.) and/or their alloys  as catalysts for the oxidation of pure fuels ( e.g. 
hydrogen, methanol) at the anode and the reduction of the oxidant ( e.g. oxygen) at the cathode,  
which work in optimized basic and/ or acid electrolytes,  resulting in  a very high  efficiency . 
However, noble metals are costly and, more importantly, are non -renewable resources  only 
available in few countries in the world . The use of electrolytes  at extremes of  pH, 
accompanying with  the requirement for expensive membrane s to separate reactions into 
individual compartment s, poses additional challenges . 
 
In addition to the need for clean and renewable energy, recent rapid advances i n 
bio-integrated implantable or  portable  electronic devices underline  the urgent need to develop 
technologies that can harvest energy from biological sources.2 A range of potential 
applications in microelectronic, biomedical, and sensor devices have inspired  research in 
energy conversion systems  utilizing  sources  such as body hea t, muscle stretching, blood flow, 
walking or running, etc.3 However,  low levels of  biocompatibility and durability  pose 
potential health and safety concerns, raising significant challenges in the successful  
development of such devices .  
 
EFCs are a subclass of fuel cells  employ ing redox enzymes as catalysts4-9. The concept of an 
EFC was first described  by Yahiro  and co -workers in 1964.10 Depending on emerging 
possible applications, EFCs have been designed in various configurations that may be quite 6 
 different from the traditional fuel cell stack s. However, they all retain the same key 
components. Similar to other  fuel cells, EFCs consist of a two -electrode cell separated by a 
proton conducting medium, which can also be an electrolyte  (Figure 1 ): using  appropriate  
redox enzymes, fuels are oxidized at the bioanode, electrons flow through the external electric 
circu it to the biocathode, where  the oxidants, usually oxygen11 or peroxides12, are reduced to 
water. Using bioelectrocatalysts, EFCs have several advantages. Firstly, the catalyst is 
renewable. Redox enzymes can be  extracted  from a wide range of living organisms in a 
renewable manner . Secondly, fuels can be diver se. In principle, sugars13, alcohols14, organic 
acids15, hydrogen16, and mixture s of these materials  that can be digested  by living organisms , 
can be use d as fuels for EFCs. Thirdly, the operational conditions are very mild and safe. The 
properties  of enzymatic reactions enable  EFCs to operate at physiological pH, room 
temperature and ambient  pressure , although  the recent use of stable extremophilic enzymes 
offer s the possibility to work at temperature s of up to 85 °C or at a pH value  as low as 2 .17,18 
In addition,  redox enzymes provide exceptional specificity towards their natural substrates , 
thus allowing  the assembl y of the bioanode and biocathode in a single  membrane -less cell  and 
the miniaturization of  EFCs.19 Another consequence of high enzyme specificity is that EFCs 
can use fuels without the need for  intensive purification steps. Finally , EFCs can be 
considered as  disposable systems  as the components can potentially be biologically degraded . 
These properties demonstrate the potential use of  EFCs in next-generation green power source 
for a range of applications.

 Bioelectrocatalysis, in which the electrons involved in  an enzymatic reaction are collected at  
an electrode surface,  is a key element of EFCs. Due to the size and structure of the enzymes, 
electron transfer (ET) within the enzyme and between the enzyme and the electrode is specific. 
In general, the electron transfer mechanisms between enzymes and electrodes  are classified 
into two types: mediated  electron transfer (MET) and direct electron transfer (DET)8,20,21. In a 
MET -type system, extrinsic  redox -active compound s such as ferrocene22, methyl viologen, 
ABTS are used as redox mediator s to shuttle electrons between the enzyme cofactor  (for 
example, glucose oxidase (GOx) uses flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the cofactor ) and 
the electrode23. In this case, the redox enzyme catalyzes the oxidation or reduction of the 
mediator as a co -substrate. The reverse transformation (regeneration) of the mediator occurs 
on the electrode surface.  The use of small, low molec ular weight electron mediators that 
require low overpotential s can be beneficial as they can enable rapid rates of electron transfer 
between an enzyme and an electrode with low power losses . However, the cost, stability, 
selectivity  and ability to exchange  electron in the immobilized state  of such mediators must 
also be considered.  In contrast, in a DET -type system, fast electron transfer to or from a  solid  
electrode occurs  through an intrinsic electron relay system in the protein20 (e.g. iron-sulfur 
clusters24,25, heme group s26,27 or copper sites28,29).  
1.2 Potential applications of EFC s 
The early dev elopment of EFCs focussed on  obtain ing electric al energy mainly through the 
oxidation of glucose or other organic fuels in living organisms, in order to drive implantable 
electronic devices. The power output of an average human body is approximately  100 W , and 
the constant presence and availability of the fuel from the body provides sufficient support for 
running EFCs30. The oxygen or other oxidant supply for the biocathode in such EFCs is 
important as EFCs are implanted in a relatively closed system. Since the first total surgical 
implantation of a EFC in a rat in 2010,31 several recent studies on implantable EFCs have 
been reported. In particular, biocathodes modified by chitosan implanted in a rat can exhibit a 
stability of up to  167 days 32. Cyborg lobsters with partially implanted EFCs were able to 8 
 power an electrical watch and a pacemaker 33, while a fully implanted EFC in rats can power 
a light -emitting diode (LED), or a digital thermometer 34. Mountab le EFCs using  trehalose in 
insect hemolymph  were also successfully demonstrated 35. However, special attention should 
be focused on solving sterilization and biocompatibility issues, as well as their poor 
operational stabilities, before such implantable or mountable EFCs can become practical, 
especially when used i n human  patients 36-40. 
 
During the past decades , significant improvements in the power output and stability of EFCs 
have been achieved, paving the way for the use of EFCs to power portable electronic devices 
such as music players, cellphones, sensors, and even laptops.  Many studies have demonstrat ed 
the use of EFCs as power sources for  LEDs or  for digital clocks 41-43. In 2007, Sony 
demonstrated that  a music player could be powered by a stack of EFCs. Later, they 
demonstrated the operation of a toy car using a  glucose -fueled  EFC. However, there are 
considerable challenges to the development of these devices as cost effective power sources 
that can be manufactured on a large scale44. 
 
Another potential  application  of EFCs is emerging with the rapid development of wearable 
electronic  device s that are shaping our life in healthcare, communication, entertainment, etc. 
Such wearable  electronic  device s can potentially  be powered by EFCs operating using  
external fuels, or directly from fuel in the body 45,46. In contrast to  implantable EFCs, 
non-invasive EFCs have attracted considerable interest 47. Several wearable EFCs have been 
constructed using lactate in sweat or in tears as the fuel and generate reasonable power 
output s48,49. Such  wearable EFCs need to be flexible in order to withstand frequent ly bend ing 
or folding. A number of  layer -by-layer or printed EFCs have been developed that exhibit 
good flexibility, high performances, and a potential of low fabrication cost s50,51. In the 
following sub-section , the main challenges of these EFCs will be discussed and the particular 
limitations of each application will be described . 9

1.3 Identification of main challenges in EFC s 
The development of EFCs faces four significant challenges: inability to completely oxidize 
fuels , low power density, poor operational stability, and limited voltage output. Although each 
of these challenges can be addressed from multiple aspects, some  potential  solutions are too 
complex to implement and may also be detrimental factors in terms of other aspects  of cell 
performance . Due to the complexity of the se challenges , a systematic analysis should be made 
to identify the key reasons behind each challenge and to then carefully evaluate mu ltiple 
possible solutions 55. 
 
10 
 Firstly, most  EFCs employ one or two oxidoredu ctases . Depending on the fuel, complete 
oxidation cannot be achived , leading to low efficiency and energy density, critical parameter s 
for all power sources. As one of the principle advantages of EFCs mentioned above, sugars or 
alcohols can store much higher energy per weight or volume than most secondary batteries 56. 
However, exploitation of  such energy storage potential requires a series of cascade reactions 
that oxidize the fuel in a step by step  manner . The use of one or two enzymes makes it  
impossible to implement the complete  oxidation of a fuel . As a consequence, the cost of fuels, 
inhibition (by product s or intermediate s), the difficult ies in reusing cells, and decrease d power 
output pose significant obstacles to the successful development of EFCs.   
 
The issue of low power output of EFCs has been a major problem that constrains potential use 
to applications57. Compared with metal -catalyzed fuel cells or lithium -ion batteries, the power 
output produced from EFCs is significantly lower. The power densities of the majority of 
EFCs lie  in the range of 1 -1000 µW cm-2, with few surpassing  1 mW cm-2 (Table 1). A 
principal reason  for this  is that the active site of enzyme  is buried inside a large insulating 
protein moiety . Typically, a 0.5 mg cm-2 Pt loading on the electrode of a metal -catalyzed fuel 
cell represents 2.5 µmol of catalyst cm-2, whi le the catalyst loading for a GOx  or laccase  
(Lac) -immobilized electrode is only at the level of 10-6 to 10-1 µmol cm-2 58,59 in an EFC 
depending on the electrode of choice . The overall reaction rate per volume or area, in terms of 
power density, for enzyme biocatalysts is decreased by orders of magnitude . In addition, the 
availability of the fuel may become a limiting factor in power generation, especially for 
implantable EFCs, which may have limited oxidant supply60. Tackling this issue requires  a 
combinatorial strategy of engineering electrode materials, enzymes, and their interfaces  as 
well as smart configuration design4. 11

 Moreover, as a typical enzyme -catalyzed system, EFCs suffer from poor operational stability, 
resulting in short lifetime s and high er costs.77,78 Instability arises not just with the enzyme, but 
also arises f rom the use of  cofactors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+), 
adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), and coenzyme A ( CoA ), which are necessary for many redox 
enzymes, and of other components that include mediators.  The complexity of biological 
systems can pose additional detrimental  effects on the stability of EFCs, such as biofouling of 
the electrode in implantable EFCs, or enzyme inhibition by O2 for H 2/O2 EFCs. In contrast to  
relatively stable proton exchange membr ane fuel cell s and metal -based batteries that can last 
for years, or microbial fuel cells  (MFCs)  utilising self -reproducing  microorganisms that can 
be reused for months, the majority of  EFCs can operate  only for hours or days79-81.   
 
For almost all reported EFCs, the voltage at which usable  power can be extracted  is below the 
minimal requirement to power commercially available electronic devices. This drawback is 
inevitable as, from a thermodynamic point of view, the maximum redox potential gap 
between two electrodes in most biological  fuel cells (e.g. ~1. 18 V for glucose/O 2 EFCs with 
two-electron oxidation of glucose ) is much less than that of lithium -based batteries (e.g. ~4.2  
V)36. In many cases, the involvement of electron mediators leads to additi onal decreases in  the 
voltage output of EFCs. In addition, the actual voltage output of EFCs is decreased by factors 
such as  ohmic and concentration losses. Such losses can also depress the current output, and 
further reduc e the overall power output.  
 
Significant developments in EFCs have occurred since the first report in 19 64. A number of  
reviews on EFCs have recently been published3,7,39,79,82 -88, the majority of which  have focused  
on either the electrode materials40,87 -95, enzyme immobilization40,90,96 -98, 
bioelectrocatalysis8,11,99 -101 or the ir applications39,40,45,47,86,88,102. Table 2  summarizes a list of 
the reviews reported since 2015 on bioelectrodes and EFCs. This review ident ifies the main 
scientific challenges hindering the development of EFCs , low energy and power densities, 18 
 poor operational stability as well as  limited voltage output , and summarize s the corresponding 
approache s to solve them.

 2. Strategies  for achieving  high energy density in EFC s 
Like other types of fuel cells, the available energy density of an EFC is dependent on  the 
product of the chemical energy stored in the fuel and the faradaic efficiency. The faradaic 
efficiency is described by:  
ηF = ∫I×dt/(c fuel×V×n×F)         (1) 
where η F = faradaic efficiency, I = current, t = reaction time, c fuel = concentration of fuel,  V = 
reaction volume, n = number of electrons generated per fuel, and F = Faraday constant 
(96,485 C per mole).  Clearly, i t is desirable to combine high-energy -density fuel s with high 
faradaic efficienc ies to achieve high energy density EFCs.  
2.1 Range of fuels in EFC s 
EFCs harness power from living and renewable biological sources. Compared with traditional 
rare metal -catalyzed fuel cells  that are predominantly  powered by hydrogen  or methanol, the 
fuel diversity of EFCs has been greatly broadened to many organic compounds which are 
common intermediates metabolized in living organisms or are the main components  of 
biomass. Although a wide variety of fuels can be used for EFCs, their energy density, cost, 
availability, an d toxicity all need to be considered . 
 
Hydrogen has one of the highest energy density values per mass  and has been widely used in 
traditional fuel cells. As a clean fuel  that can be produced from biomass or water splitting , it 
can also be used in an EFC catalyzed by hydrogenases.16,88,152 -154 Storage and distribution of 
H2 have been the subject of intensive research, enabling the  use of H2 in a safe manner . 
Alternatively, f ormic acid is a stable hydrogen carrier and has been used to power some EFCs 
due to its advantages of high volumetric capacity (53 g H 2 L-1), low toxicity and flammability 
under ambient conditions. Methanol is another promising  alternative to hydrogen as a fuel 
because  it is accessible and easy to transport and store , although it is toxic for human beings if 
ingested . It has a nearly 3 -fold higher volumetric energy density than that of formic acid. 25 
 Furtherm ore, the theoretical maximum voltage  for a methanol /oxygen fuel cell (1.19 V ) is 
close to  that for a H2/O2 fuel cell (1.23 V)155. Although ethanol is rarely considered as a fuel 
source  in fuel cells , it has some advantages, such as low cost , non -toxic ity and wide 
availab ility. In addition , ethanol is a renewable energy source that can be generated  through 
fermentation of agricultural products. As another prospective fuel , glycerol  has many 
desirable qualities and is abundant since it is a by -product of biodiesel production. Properties 
such as low toxicity, low flammability , extremely low vapor pressure and high energy density 
make glycerol very appealing as an energy source 156. Pyruvate, a key intermediate from  the 
glycolysis pathway, has also been used as a fuel in EFCs157. Finally, it is noteworthy that  the 
most common ly used  fuels are sugars as they are inexpensive, abundant, renewable, and safe  
to use . They can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass (ca. 1 ×1011 tons/year  globally ), 
which can be locally grown and are more evenly distributed than fossil fuels. Among various 
sugars, g lucose is the most widely  used fuel in EFCs, and glucose -based EFCs are particularly 
suited for implantable applications due to its presence in blood at reasonable concentrations 
(mM). Many other sugars including xylose, fructose, sucrose, and polysaccharides such as 
maltodextrin have also been  used in  EFCs56,158,159. 
 
Full exploitation of the energy stored in a substrate can provide high energy densities, a key 
advantage of EFCs compared with commonly available batteries. Theoretically,  glucose 
possesses an energy density of 4 ,125 Wh L-1 releasing  24 electrons per glucose molecule to 
produce  carbon dioxide and water . Hence,  the complete enzymatic oxidation of the  glucose 
units of a 15% maltodextrin solution indicates  that the energy -storage density of the EFC can 
be as high as 596 Ah kg-1, which is  an order of magnitude higher than that  of lithium -ion 
batteries and primary batteries42. Glycerol has a n even higher energy density (6 ,260 Wh L-1) 
compared to glucose, or to ethanol (5 ,442 Wh L-1), methanol (4 ,047 Wh L-1), making it a very 
attractive fuel.  Notably, pyruvate also has a high energy density  (4,594 Wh  L-1), and require s 
fewer enzymes than glucose for complete oxidation.  
 26 
 2.2 Enzyme cascades for the deep/complete oxidation of fuels  
When building an EFC, maximizing both energy density and power density is of crucial 
importance.  The majority of EFCs utilize s a single enzyme to perform  partial oxidation of a 
fuel (i.e. glucose, lactate, pyruvate  or ethanol), but the complete oxidation of the majority of 
fuels require s several  enzymes to use the energy  available  in the  fuel82. As a relevant example, 
when the degree of catalytic oxidation as well as the maximum allowable fuel concentration 
are taken into account , the energy density of an ethanol fuel cell  based on 20% v/v ethanol 
with incomplete oxidation to acetic acid decreases  from 5,442 to 363  Wh L–1 156. Therefore , 
one of the key issues in developing high-energy -density  EFCs is the successful design  of 
multi -enzyme systems that can completely oxidize the fuel in order to increase the overall 
energy efficiency.  
 
Living cells are able to  completely oxidize complex fuels into carbon dioxide and water  
through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a crucial metabolic pathway 160. In the cycle,  
acetyl -CoA is oxidi zed to carbon dioxi de and water , generat ing the reduced forms of 
nicotinamide -adenine dinucleotide (NADH ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2) and 
chemical energy in the form of ATP.  Several fuels can be fed into the TCA cycle , and each 
require s different sets of enzyme cascades. One of these fuels  is glucose , which can be 
oxidized through the glycolysis pathway to pyruvate, which is subsequently  oxidized to 
acetyl -CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Lactate can also enter into the TCA cycle after 
dehydrogenation by lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH) . Ethanol has also been used as  a substrate 
by introducing alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldDH), and 
S-acetyl CoA synthetase  to oxidize  ethanol into acetyl -CoA 160. By mimicking the natural 
TCA pathway, several EFCs have been developed that can completely oxidize glucose, 
ethanol, pyruvate, and lactate. For instance, in an ethanol/O 2 EFC, dehydrogenases along with 
non-energy produ cing enzymes necessary for the cycle were  immobilized in cascades onto a 
carbon  electrode  in a tetrabutylammonium bromide modified Nafion membrane , generating 
an 8.71-fold increase in power density compared to a single enzyme ( ADH )-based ethanol/air 27 
 EFC 161. In another mitochondria -based fuel cell  consisting of all the enzyme s involv ed in the 
TCA cycle, pyruvate was converted to acetyl -CoA by a pyruvate dehydrogenase and further 
oxidized by the enzyme cascade . A 4.6-fold increase in power density was observed when 
using intact mitochondria as compared to that using an individu al enzyme in the TCA cycle  
162. It should be noted however that the increased power densities obtained in these systems 
161,162 are still significantly lower than the theoretically expected values . 
 
In addition to mimic  the natural pathways, in vitro  synthetic pathways  to completely oxidize 
fuels  have been described . The first EFC based on enzyme cascades that can completely 
transform alcohols was demonstrated in 1998155, wh ere three NAD -dependent 
dehydrogenases including ADH, AldDH and formate dehydrogenase (F oDH) were employed 
to fully oxidize methanol to carbon dioxide and water  (Figure 3). Six electrons  per methanol 
molecule  were collected at the bioanode when NADH was re -oxidized into NAD+ with the 
assistance of redox mediators. However, thi s complete oxidation process relied on  enzymes in 
solution rather than immobiliz ed at the electrode surface.  Later , Minteer  et al.  124 conducted a 
series  of studies of enzyme immobiliza tion based on this pathway, including encapsulation 
within hydrophobically modified Nafion163 and self -assembled enzymatic hydrogel164. An 
EFC based on the two-step oxidation of ethanol to acetate mediated by  ADH and AldDH was 
described161.

Presently , the growth of the biodiesel industry has great ly increased the production  of 
glycerol165. As already stated above, e mploying glycerol as a fuel for bioelectricity generation 
is a promi sing route. However, c atalysts based on precious metals can only remove four 
electrons of  a total of sixteen electrons available for the complete oxidation of glycerol  156, 
leading to a low energy density.  In contrast , EFCs have the ability to exploit the energy of 
glycerol by employing  an enzym e cascade to oxidi ze glycerol  in a stepwise pathway . It has 
been demonstrat ed that a three -enzyme ca scade containing pyrroloquinoline quinone 
(PQQ) -dependent ADH , AldDH s and oxalate oxidase immobilized within a Nafion 
membrane can accomplish the complete oxidation of glycerol, with a fuel utilization 
efficiency up to 98.9%156. More recently, a  hybrid enzymatic  and abiotic  catalytic system  that 
combin ed free oxalate oxidase and 4 -amino -TEMPO  was constructed  to electrochemically 
oxidize glycerol  at a carbon electrode, collecting as many as 16 electrons per molecule of 
glycerol  166.

The majority of glucose -fed EFCs are based on one oxidoreductase (i.e., GOx  or 
NAD -dependent glucose dehydrogenase  (GDH) ), generati ng only 2 of total 24  electrons per 
glucose52,168. In order to achieve more complete oxidation of glucose, Gor ton et al. developed 
a highly efficient anode for glucose -based EFCs by combining pyranose dehydrogenase from 
Agaricus meleagris  (AmPDH) and cellobiose dehydrogenase fro m Myriococcum 
thermophilum  (MtCDH), resulting in up to six electrons being obtained by the oxidation of 
one glucose molecule169. Inspired by the  metabolic pathways in living cells  to fully oxidize  
glucose, Minteer et al.  170 proposed  a six -enzyme system  at a bioanode to oxidize glucose to 
CO 2. It was however difficult to confirm that the complete oxidation of glucose had occurred  
because CO 2 could be produced from intermediate reactions . Zhu et al.171 designed a novel 
synthetic pathway containing  two NAD -dependent dehydrogenases  (i.e. glucose -6-phosph ate 
dehydrogenase and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ) to perform the oxidation of glucose, 
generating  four electrons per molecule of glucose . The same authors  designed a synthetic 
enzymatic pathway that was comprise d of 13 enzymes in an air -breathing enz ymatic fuel cell 
to completely oxidize the glucose units of maltodextrin  and generate  nearly 24 electrons per 
glucose unit42. Three functional modules were assembled to oxidize the substrate, transfer 
electron, and regenerate the intermediate. First, glucose u nits in maltodextrin were converted 
to glucose 6 -phosphate (G6P) by  the enzymes  glucan phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase . 
Next, during the two -step oxidation of G6P  by glucose 6 -phosphoate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 
and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  (6PGD H), NAD+ was simultaneously reduced to 
NADH, which was subsequently re -oxidized by diaphorase (DI), producing two electrons per 
NADH. Other enzymes were used to convert the 5-carbon intermediate to the 6-carbon G6P. 
The oxidation and regeneration steps were repeated six times in order to fully oxidize G6P , 
releas ing 24 electrons.  As a result, an EFC containing a 15% (wt/v) maltodextrin solution had 30 
 an energy -storage density of 596 Ah kg-1 and a faradaic  efficiency of 92.3%. Nevertheless , 
this pathway utilized  polysaccharides, such as maltodextrin and starch, and cannot be applied 
directly to glucose.  Later, based on  a combination of glycolysis and the pentose  phosphate 
pathway, an in vitro  synthetic enzymatic pathway was demonstrated to generate close to the 
theoretical ly available  yield of electrons  from glucose. This pathway does not involve ATP, 
CoA, or membrane proteins . The r eaction rate was enhanced after replacing several enzymatic 
building blocks and introduc ing a new enzyme, 6 -phosphogluconolacton ase. Using this new 
pathway, a high farada ic efficiency of 98.8% was obtained , with a  maximum current density 
of 6.8 mA cm-2. Similarly,  an in vitro  15-enzyme pathway that can co -utilize glucose, sucrose 
and fructose in EFCs was designed  by incorporating the corresponding enzymes in the sugar 
conversion module. G6P was obtained after several sugar phosphorylation steps and then 
entered into the oxidation and regeneration modules as described above. The EFC achiev ed a 
faradaic efficiency of approximately 95%  for these three sugars and yield ed a maximum 
power density of 1.08 mW cm-2 (Figure 4) 167. This work was the first to demonstrate the use 
of sugar mixtures as the fuel in EFCs and the achievement of close to the theoretical ly 
available  energy density. In addition to the hexose  fuels mentioned above , xylose as the 
second largest mono -saccharide a nd the most abundant pentose in plant biomass , is also a 
promising sugar fuel . Recently, a reconstituted bacterial pentose phosphate pathway in vitro  
was confirmed  to generate a nearly theoretical yield of electricity from xylose in EFCs for the 
first time172. The complete oxidation of xylose can pave the way for the co -utilization of 
hexose and pentose in biomass and is a promising method for the  produc tion of  
bioresource -derived electricity172. 
 
However, the use of enzyme cascade s introduces a number of challenges  such as increased 
complexity. The overall stability of an EFC is limited by the enzyme that possesses the lowest 
stability  (e.g., as low as several hours at room temperature) . The o peration  of EFCs can be  
compromised sin ce specific enzymes have various optimal temperatures and pHs42. The 
amount of each immobilized enzyme  on the surface of electrodes  is limited with a fixed 31 
 number  of anchoring points to host the enzy mes. Electrode fouling together  with enzyme or 
cofactor degradation is an additional  concern in such systems. Therefore , it makes sense to 
precise ly localiz e enzymes in a sequential  manner  to increase the overall flux173. Enzyme 
complexes or in vitro metabo lons, facilitating the transfer of intermediates between enzymatic 
steps, have been constructed as an efficient approach to accelerate cascade reactions174. Liu et 
al.175 synthesized an enzyme complex by covalently modifying hexokinas e (HK) and G6PDH 
with a poly(Lys) bridge. The enzyme complex was synthetically cross -linked and able to 
facilitate electrostatic substrate channeling by shorten ing the lag time required to reach steady 
state. Another work reported  the assembl y of an ADH and AldDH  enzyme cascade ‐based 
bioanode via  a protein purification ‐free approach in a methanol biofuel cell . By using a 
designed DNA duplex sequence , sub strate channeling between active sites of cascade 
enzymes was  observed and the power density of the biofuel cell  increased by 73%176. In 
addition, e nzyme complex or metabolon based EFCs have also been considered  as a 
promising alternative to obtain significantly improvement in faradaic efficiency and 
stability177. To understand the mechanisms involved in such cascade reactions, differential 
electrochemical mass spectrometry could be used to  provide relevant information o n the 
products formed at each step178. 
3. Strategies  for increasing  power density in EFC s 
3.1 Evaluation of different power output results  
The power output of EFCs is a vital criterion to determine which applications can actually be 
considered. In practice, the polarization curve (voltage -current profile) and the corresponding 
power output profile can be obtained using four methods179: i) discharge the EFC at specified 
resistances by connecting the EFC to a resistor and measuring a series of currents and voltages 
obtained on var ying the resistance; ii) potentiodynamic discharge: record the response 
(voltage -current plots) at a relatively slow sweep rate (typically no more than 1 mV s-1); iii) 
potentiostatic discharge: apply various discharge voltages and record the currents gener ated; iv) 32 
 galvanostatic discharge: discharge the EFC at various currents and record the associated voltages. 
Accordingly, the operational stability of an EFC can also be monitored over time using these four 
methods. Methods i), iii) and iv) are most conven ient and the most frequently used for long -term 
testing.  
 
One of the issues  concerned with the evaluation of the performance of EFC s is the definition 
of their power output. The power output  is generally reported  as the power density, as is 
widely used wit h batteries and other fuel cells. However, arbitrary comparison between power 
densities reported in the literature can be misleading in EFCs due to significant variations in 
the type of electrode material, method of enzyme immobilization, enzyme loading, e tc.). 
 
The majority of  reports on power densit ies in the literature  are based on  the projected 
geometric surface area  of the electrodes (Table 1)11. However , such reported power densities 
do not consider the morphology of the electrode materials nor the loading of  immobilized 
biocatalysts. In the last decade, porous nanostructured materials with high conductivities have 
been employed as electrode s, due to their large  hierarchical porosity,  and high surface  areas92. 
The power density of EFCs based on porous nanostructured materials increased from μW 
cm–2 to mW cm–2, calculated according to the geometric areas of the electrodes  (Table 1) 
43,62,180,181. Nonetheless, these  values cannot accurately represent the real power densities as 
due to  the high porosity of the electrode s, the real surface area s are much larger than the 
geometric area s. Just to give one example, a  compressed multi -walled carbon nanotube  
(MWCNT )-based bioelectrode used in a glucose EFC exhibited an electroactive area of 52 
cm2 for an interfacial geometrical area of 1.3 cm2, which corresponds to 0.01% of its BET 
surface area59. Moreover, calculation of the power  density  is dependent on  the method used to 
determine the  electroactive surfaces  area. The electroactive  surface  area based on capacitance 
measurements is more accurate than that obtained from voltametric response of redox 
molecule  probes126. Additionally, i n the case  of an EFC utilizing a bioanode and  a biocathode  
with different surface areas, the  geometric surface area of the  rate-limiting bioelectrode is 33 
 commonly used to calculate the power density.  For example, a H 2/O2 EFC requires a bilirubin 
oxidase ( BOD )-modified cathode with an area of 6 cm2 to match the output of a 1.2 cm2 
hydrogenase  (Hase) -modified anode182. Therefore, balanc ing of the catalytic performance of a 
cell requires consideration of the appropriate sizes of the electrodes.  
 
The weight or the volume of an EFC is another critical parameter  in the evaluation of 
performance. T he specific power can be determined in mW g−1 or mW cm−3, and is particularly  
suitable for three -dimension structured  electrodes9,183. In terms of potential applications for 
portable power sources, the power density normalized to the overall weight is important, 
although few reports providing these values59. As a simpl e example, a net power of 10 -20 W is 
required to power a laptop184, and a high -power -density -per-gram will help to reduce the weight. 
For an implantable EFC, the volumetric power dens ity is the most important parameter (more 
detailed discussion is in Section 3.4).  The power output of EFCs needs to be described in a 
manner that enables direct comparison between different systems59,185. The express ion of power 
density in multiple forms is therefore recommended . For example, the power  output of  an EFC 
based on the naphthoquinone -mediated oxidation of glucose in a CNT 3D matrix was expressed 
in mW cm–2, mW mL–1 and mW g–1 simultaneously41. The same approach was used for  a 
membrane - and mediator -free glucose/O 2 EFC utilizing novel  graphene/ single -wall carbon 
nanotube  co-gel electrodes186. Reporting the data in this format makes it feasible to compare 
results in an effective manner.  
 
The number of enzyme molecules involved in the biocataly tic process  is an additional key factor  
for the evaluation  and comparison of the performance of bioelectrodes. It is thus necessary to 
report enzyme loadings applied on the electrode and to estimate the amount of electroactive 
enzymes . However, this determination is not obvious, and relies on the determination of  the 
non-catalytic signals of enzymes obtained under non -turn-over conditions. Although this 
information has often been reported for Lac187,188 or BOD189,190, it has only once been reported for 
hydrogenase67. Low enzyme coverage can render  such a determination  difficult . Even when 34 
 obtained, it is necessary to ensure that the species involved in the baseline  signal appearance  are 
identical to those  involved in the cataly tic measurements . This last condition is only rarely 
satisfied, however, leading to misleading values. The work from Mazurenko et al., should be 
noted where the authors rigorously followed the evolution of the non -catalytic signals related to  
the FeS clusters of the AaHase with the decrease of the catalytic signal for H 2 oxidation, allowing 
the accurate determination of the amount of  enzyme involved in the catalytic process67. In 
addition , it is essential  to consider the fuel concentration when comparing the power density 
(Table 1). 
 
Besides the above -mentioned factors that  influence power output , an analysis of the reaction 
occurr ing in each compartment of an EFC should be carefully made.  A typical bioelectrocatalytic 
reaction is comprise d of i) mass transpor t of the reactant from the bulk  solution to the active site 
on the solid surface, ii) enzymatic reaction with the reactant, iii) electron transfer between active 
sites of the enzyme and the electrode, and iv) diffusion of the products into the solution from the 
solid-liquid interface  (Figure 5)77. The identification and enhancement of the current density of 
the limiting bioelectrode  in a given system with fixed electrode geometries , either the bioanode 
or biocathode with the lower net catalytic current  density, are crucial77,191. In the following 
section s, we will discuss the  general  strategies to increase the current density of a single 
bioelectrode  using  fast rates of  ET80, in addition to  mass transport issues and cell configuration 
design.

3.2 Increasing intrinsic enzyme activities  
The catalytic response of enzymes in solution is generally characterized by the Michaelis -Menten 
equation192: 
         
                           
where  V is the rate of reaction, V max the maximum rate of reaction,  KM the Michaelis constant  
(the substrate concentration at which V is equal to V max/2). The  turnover frequency, k cat is defined 
as: 
         
                            
where [E] o is the enzyme concentration. These kinetic parameters can be obtained by assaying 
the enzyme activity193. Enzyme activity is widely used as an indicator to compare the  biocatalytic 
efficiency of a single enzyme using various substrates and of different enzymes for the same  
substrate 194. The ratio kcat/KM is independent  of the concentration of enzyme and substrate . One 
international unit (U) of an enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes  the 
conversion of  1 μmol of reactant  per min  195. Accordingly, s pecific enzyme activity  (in U  mg-1 or 
U g-1) represents the number of units of  enzyme per mg or g of protein.  Actual enzyme activit y 
after long -term storage of enzymes should be reported.  It should be noted that these activities are 
defined based on their optimal conditions that may not be the same as the condition of running a 
specific EFC. In EFCs, attention  needs  to focus on the enzyme activity  at the electrode  interface . 
In many cases involving enzyme immobilization, the actual activity of immobilized enzyme may 
be not as high as predicted  due to enzyme deactivation and mass transfer barrier s. It is necessary  
to consider the number  of enzymes per electrode or per cell in order to appropriately  compare the 
performance of  different EFC systems.   
 
Naturally occurring enzymes may not possess sufficiently high activities that are  required  for 
EFCs . Therefore,  substantial  efforts have been made  on enzyme engineering to improve the 36 
 cataly tic activities and  rates of  electron transfer 196. Here, we focus on discussing the engineering 
on GOx , one of the most widely used  enzymes in bioelectrodes , to demonstrate  general strategies 
including direct and random site mutagenesis as well as enzyme de -glycosylation  that can be 
used to improve the current density . Schwaneberg  et al. employed d irected protein evolution  in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to screen li braries of mutants . They  found a GOx mutant  (I115V), 
close to the FAD centre , with 1.4-1.5 times higher activity for glucose  oxidation  197. A similar  
approach led to a double mutant  GOx  (T30S  and I94V ) that display ed an  increased k cat/KM 198. 
Altering expression strains is an additional route to altering the properties of enzymes.  On 
replacing  native GOx from Aspergillus niger  with Penicillium pinophilum  GOx  at an 
Os-complex modified  polymer “wired” bioanode , Mano et al. reported a n EFC show ing an 
increase  in power density from 90 to 280 μW cm-2 199. This increase was induced by the lower 
KM (6.2 mM) of PpGOx compared to  that of AnGOx (20 mM) , resulting in a bioanode with 
higher catalytic current in the presence of only 5 mM glucose . A recombinant GOx from 
Penicillium amagasakiense  has been overexpressed in a secreted active form display ing a kcat/KM 
in homogeneous glucose solution  of 155 mM-1 s-1, which was much higher than that of a AnGOx 
(38 mM-1 s-1) 200. Using ferroc ene-methanol  as a mediator, the electro catalytic current observed 
towards glucose oxidation was two -fold higher with the recombinant GOx  than with a native one 
200. De-glycosylat ed GOx  in combination with an Os -polymer mediator showed an  18% increase 
in current density , which is likely a consequence of the shortened distance between the active site  
of the enzyme and the redox mediator, as well as improved mediator utilization  due to  the 
decreased molecular size after de-glycosylation  201. 
3.3 Facilitating electron transfer  
The rate of ET play s an important role in determining the power output of many EFCs. 
According to Marcus ’s theory, the reorganization energy and the distance between the donor and 
the acceptor determine the rate of ET202, which  decreases by an  order of magnitude for every 2.3 
Å increase in distance203. An upper threshold of 15 Å is thus required for efficient direct electron 
transfer ( DET ) 204. The structure and conformation  of the enzyme may present a cofactor  in close 37 
 proximity to the electrode to maximi ze the rate of  ET 205, so that the current density of the 
bioelectrode can be enhanced . However, many  cofactors and active sites reside  inside insulating 
protein shells , introducing barriers to effective rates of long distance  ET. In this section,  we start 
with introducing several important equations and theories of ET. A summary of  the common 
DET-capable enzymes along with the brief description of  their structur al features  is followed . We 
then discuss  strategies , such as electode surface modification  for suitable enzyme orientation  and 
enzyme engineering,  to bring the enzyme cofactor closer to the electrode surface  to facilitate 
DET for high -current -density bioelectrodes . The difference between DET and MET - based 
bioelectrodes will be briefly discussed , while  MET will be further detailed in Section 5.1  when 
discussing  the EFC voltage . 
 
Protein film voltammetric techniques (PFV) can be used to characterise redox enzymes in 
detail206,207. It describes the noncatalytic situation of DET -capable enzymes that are in 
(sub-)/monolayer configuration displaying the cofactors based well-defined voltammetry on the 
electrode surface. The empirical Butler -V olmer e quations reveal that interfacial ET rates 
exponentially increase with the activation potential (driving force)208. Convenient forms of the 
Butler -V olmer expression describing the electrochemical rate const ants for a reversible redox 
reaction ( kred and koxi) of a one -electron couple are: 
                
             (4) 
                    
           (5) 
where k0 is the standard first-order electrochemical rate constant,  is the electron -transfer 
coefficient, η the activation potential, R the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. k0 can 
be determined by Lav iron’s method by plotting the voltammetric peak potential versus the 
logarithm of the scan rate209.  
 
Marcus theory describes the relationship between k0 and the tunnelling distance d, which is 
the distance between the electrode surface to the electron’s entry /leaving  point in the 38 
 DET-capable enzyme208:  
                      (6) 
where β is a decay constant. A dispersion of tunneling distance s (i.e. various enzyme 
orientation s) leads to a dispersion of  values of  k0. The mathematic model developed by Léger  
et al. can describe  the distribution of DET -capable enzyme orientations208,210. 
 
The surface coverage ( ) of (sub-)/monolayered DET-active enzymes  can be evaluated from the 
voltammetric peak current ( Ip) obtained for the oxidation/reduction of the co -factor under 
non-turnover conditions , which is proportional to the enzyme concentration:  
         
                (7) 
where v is the scan rate of the voltammetric method and A is the surface area.  
 
 is equivalent to [E] o in eq. 3, assuming  that all of the electrochemical -addressable enzymes are 
involved in the catalytic reaction . kcat can be obtained using the saturated electrocatalytic current 
(Icatsat)211: 
            
               (8) 
The electrochemical form of the Michaelis -Menten equation is206: 
               
                (9) 
When the bioelectrode is studied further using rotating -disc voltammetry (RDV), the limiting 
current ( IL) of the bioelectrocatalytic current can be described by the Koutecky -Levich 
approximation:  
 
    
      
      
           (10) 
where Icat describes the intrinsic catalytic curren t of the enzyme, defined by eq. 9; ILev which is 
described by the Levich equation, is dependent on the rate of rotation and is limited by substrate 
diffusion between the enzyme and bulk solution206; IE is determined by the Butler -V olmer 
equation  (eq.4 and 5) describing  the rate of interfacial electron transfer between the electrode and 
the enzyme. For a first order reaction,  39 
                     (11) 
where kE is the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant  (i.e. either kred in eq. 4 or koxi in eq. 5). 
 
Detailed  consideration of the 3D structure of a protein is essential  to rationalize  the electrode 
surface  functionalization for a prefered DET128. X-ray crystallographic structures of many 
enzymes are available, and cryo -electron microscop y has the potential to significantly expand the 
number of structures and in particular of larger enzymes and enzyme complexes212. There has 
been much  debate on considering  ET via electronic relays within  an enzyme subunit as a DET 
process213. As an il lustration, electrons generated  upon H 2 oxidation at the NiFe active site 
located in the large subuni t of an hydrogenase travel  through three FeS clusters in the small 
subunit of the protein24. Another relevant example is CDH  in which the heme domain acts as the 
electronic relay132. In this review, ET between the electrode and the catalytic center of an enzyme 
via a built-in redox relay is regarded as DET  (Figure 6B) 125. These redox relays are present in  a 
range of  sugar oxidizing enzymes  used at  the bioanode . CDH  is a flavocytochrome composed of 
a catalytically active flavodehydrogenase domain and a cytochrome domain acting as a built -in 
ET relay (Figure 6C) 214,215. Another relevant example is FDH, a flavohemoprotein with three 
subunits 216,217: subunit I with covalently bound FAD showing a pH -dependent formal redox 
potential, Eo’, of -0.034 V vs. SHE at pH 5.5 for catalytic oxidation of D-fructose; subunit II 
containing three heme c moieties with Eo’ of 0. 135, 0.251 and 0. 537 V at pH 5.5, the heme with 
the lowest Eo’ suggested to be the exit sit e for ET pathway 218; and subunit III, whose function is 
still unclear and does not carry any redox centers. Bacterial derived, hetero -oligomeric 
FAD -dependent GDH (FAD -GDH) consisting of a FAD based catalytic subunit, a small 
chaperone subunit and a multi -haem ET subunit219, is also capable of DET. A [3Fe -4S] cluste r 
has been identified in this FAD -GDH type, acting as a ET bridge between FAD and the 
multi -heme cytochrome c subunit220. Quinohaemoprotein -type PQQ -dependent enzymes (e.g. 
GDH221,222, ADH223 and LDH224) contain PQQ prosthetic group coordinated with the apoenzyme 
with Ca2+ and heme -c moieties performing as ET relay225. As demonstrated by Sode et al., 
enzyme fusion can be employed to promote DET by introducing a cytochrome domain to the 40 
 catalytic domain of non-quinohemoprotein -type PQQ -GDH226 and fungi -derived FAD -GDH227, 
suggesting a powerful strategy that can be expanded to a wide range of DET -capabl e fusion 
enzymes. The use of  built-in redox relay is also the case with H2 oxidizing enzymes. 
[NiFe] -hydrogenases catalyzing H 2 oxidation possess a [NiFe] catalytic site accompanied with 
Fe-S clusters distant less than 10 Å to facilitate intra - then interm olecular ET between the 
catalytic site and either c -type or the b -type cytochromes ( Figure 6D) 88,228,229. On the cathodic 
side, the copper site T1  of multicopper oxidases ( MCOs ) is the site where the nat ural substrate 
binds. It is located near the shell of the enzyme allowing ET with the electrode surface. O 2 is 
reduced to H 2O with four electrons transferred over a short distance (13 Å) at the combined 
T2/T3 (binuclear) trinuclear cluster (TNC) ( Figure 6A) 11,230. Immobilization of the enzyme w ith 
the electronic relay facing the electrode is necessary for efficient DET to occur . Suitable 
electrode surfaces are crucial for appropriate enzyme orientation  to ensure favorable rates of 
DET  21,154,231 -235. In this electrode -protein recognition for DET, electrostatic and hydrophobic 
interactions are mainly involved. In case of electrostatic driven orientation, the distribution of 
charges on the protein surfaces was proved to be essential for DET 236. The calculation of the 
protein dipole moment is thus highly informative in describing  favorable enzyme orientations at 
a charged electrode surface234,237.  
 
Analysis of the shape of the electrochemical signal, especially using cyclic voltam metry, allows 
an estimation of the distribution of orientation of the enzymes on the electrode208,236. In situ 
surface techniques can provide additional information about any modification in enzyme 
orientation or conformation after immobilization on conductive supports. Furthermore, the 
support material  (usually made of gold)  used in these techniques  can simultaneously act as the 
electrode  and makes it possible to quantify  any change of the enzyme confor mation and 
orientation under turnover as a function of applied potential, concentration of substrate, 
temperature, time etc .128,129 Ellipsometry can be used to examine the dielectric properties of thin 
films, and can provide details of the thickness of the enzyme layer.  In situ ellipsometry 
measurements empha sized that MCOs  immobilized on bare gold tend to adopt a flattened 41 
 conformation explaining their deactivation238. The same technique showed that monolayers of 
MvBOD were formed irrespective of composition of the self -assembled -monolayer used for gold 
modification, although significantly different catalytic signals were recorded.  Such a result is 
indicative of different orientations of the enzyme, which was confir med by the electrochemical 
response.239 Surface plasmon resonance and quartz -crystal microbalance  (QCM) can be used to 
quantify the total amount of enzyme immobilized on the electrode, and the variation of this 
quantity under turnover and as a function of the local environment240. Correlation with the 
electrochemi cal response can  allow the determination of the proportion of DET -oriented 
enzymes234. QCM with dissipation (QCM -D) provides additional information on the 
viscoelasticity of the deposited element. Using QCM -D, loss of activity of MvBOD was 
demonstrated to be related to change in enzyme hydration rather than enzyme desorption241. 
ATR -Fourier -transform infrared (FTIR) s pectroscopy is a powerful in situ method which has 
been used to study changes in the secondary structures of immobilized enzymes. In the case of 
BODs239, or hydrogenases242, the conservation of the  intensity of the  amide I and II bands , 
fingerprints of the polypeptide backbone, proved that the enzyme ’s secondary structure was 
maintained upon immobili zation. Alternatively, surface enhanced resonance Raman (SERR) and 
surface enhanced IR absorption (SEIRA) are sensitive methods to monitor  enzyme orientation in 
the immobilized state. Using SERRS on Lac immobilized on gold nanoparticles , Shleev et al. 
demonstrated that  ET occurred via a pathway through the trinuclear cluster instead of Cu T1243. 
Heidary et al. were able to correlate enzymatic oxidation  of H2 to the orientation of a hydrogenase 
on SAMs244. Utilizing  the surface selection rules, polarization modulation ‐infrared 
reflection ‐adsorption spectroscopy (PM ‐IRRAS) was  successfully  used to differentiate 
hydrogenase orientation as a function of the hydrophobicity of the electrode242. Angles of 25° 
and 40° between the normal to the electrode surface and the -helix  as a main component  of the 
enzyme , were found on negatively charged and hydrophobic SAMs , respectively. Different 
enzyme orientation could be correlated with the rate of enzymatic oxidation of H 2. A similar 
study was conducted on Lac245,246, demonstrat ing that  the orientation of beta -sheet moi eties 
controlled the rate of catalysis. Finally, in situ microscopies (atomic force microscopy (AFM), 42 
 scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)) can be used to indicate the location of an enzyme and to 
also provide conformational information.  Studies carried out by Ul strup’s group on nitrate 
reductase247 and De Lacey’s group on hydrogenases248 and ATP synthase249 are particulary  
relevant. For example , using in situ high -speed AFM, the dynamic motion of the 
dehydr ogenase -cytochrome interdomain of CDH  occur red only in the presence of the sub strate, 
paving the way for improved understanding of the mechanism of catalysis250. 
 
This in -depth knowledg e acquired thanks to structure examination and in situ coupled techniques 
guide further enzyme or electrode modifications for enhanced ET rate. Different strategies have 
been reported in the litterature. For example, a comprehensive  study  was reported for  the 
immobilization of MvBOD  and BpBOD  on CNTs bearing different surface charges 236. The 
respective surface charges and dipole moment s of both BOD s were shown to  determine the 
optimal  electrostatic  interaction s betw een enzymes and CNT  surfaces for efficient DET.  Surface 
bearing polyaromatic hydrocarbons that mimics the natural substrates of MCOs (e.g. bilirubin for 
BOD 70,251) were able to  orient the enzymes with the appropriate configuration minimizing the 
distance towards the T1 site 252-254. When bilirubin was adsorbed on a carbon b lack based 
electro de for BOD immobilization, the standard ET rate constant increased by a factor of 3  with a 
maximum current density of 5 mA cm-2 70. Coupled with a FDH based bioanode, the fructose/O 2 
EFC exhibited a considerable maximal power density ( Pmax) of 2.6 mW cm-2. After introduction 
of pyrenebutyric acid functional groups onto the electrode, the DET current density of a BOD 
electrode showed ca. 6 -fold enhancement over random ly adsor bed system  254. Some other 
relevant examples include, electrode surfaces functionalized with 2 -carboxy -6-naphtoyl and 
4-aminoaryl diazonium salt to favor DET of MvBOD and Trametes hirsuta  Lac (ThLac), 
respectively, due to their different binding conditions surrounding Cu T1 pockets255,256. In 
particular, naphthoate -modified MWCNTs functionalized by electrografting induce favorable 
orientation of Magnaporthe orizae  BOD  (MoBOD ) that can surpass MvBOD in terms of both 
current densities and minimal overpotentials.256 Otherwise, h ydrophobic interactions have been 
widely used to enhance DET of Lac taking advantage of its hydrophobic pocket 181,257,258, 43 
 achieving excellent maximum current densities several (mA cm-2) towards oxygen reduction 
at pH 5.  For example, the efficient immobilization and orientation of Trametes versicolor  Lac 
(TvLac) on MWCNT electrodes using adamantane -pyrene derivative, confirmed by 
electrochemistry, theoretical calculations and quartz crystal microbalance experiments led to 
maximum current densities of 2.4 mA cm-2 .259 
 
Besides  electrode surface functionalization , enzyme engineering faces a growing interest for 
specific enzyme wiring for enhanced ET. Trametes sp.  Lac was designed with a single pyrene 
group  close to  the T1 Cu site  260. Specific interaction via π -stacking with CNT  sidewalls and 
host-guest interaction with β -cyclodextrin, enabled a  shorten ed ET route to the electrode, 
resulting in high catalytic current densities  with a 4.2 fold increase  over th at obtained with  
unmodified Lac 260. One very recent st rategy relies on the  incorporation of noncanonical amino 
acids into designed sites of the target enzyme 261,262. The great advantage is the possibility to graft 
specific functions at a desired location on the protein. Click chemistry was employed  to form a 
covalent linkage between the alkyne moiety and the electrode surface. The anchoring position 
on the enzyme and  the linker length can  be tuned to understand the mechanism of DET 262. 
Site-directed mutagenesis was used with CDH to enable highly site -specific immobilization via 
introduced cysteine residues on the protein surface and surface -grafted maleimide groups  263. 
Covalent binding o f the variant s close to the heme cofactor  showed 60-80% higher DET current  
over the physical adsorpt ion approach due to improved  enzyme orientation263. Although not 
widely applied but of interest, deglycosylated enzymes permit DET due to their decreased 
molecular weight/size and thus shortened distance s for  ET264. Mano et al. reported a 
deglycosylated AnGOx which preserved its activity with the direct redox reaction of FAD 
occurring at -0.687 V vs. SHE265. PDH carries covalently bound FAD as the cofactor and its 
deglycosylated form undergoes DET on a graphite electrode266. 44

Many enzymes that have been identified for use in EFCs cannot be wired  in an optimal manner , 
however, either because the structure is not known to a sufficiently high resolution so that the 
parameters for an orientation favouring DET are unknown, or because the active site is isolated 
from the surface by glycosylation or the presence of detergents in the case of membrane enzymes. 
It is noteworthy for example that native GOx cannot  undergo DET at CNT or graphene based 
electrode 267-269, as it is heavily glycosylated with an FAD group that is too deeply buried (at least 
1.7 nm from the surface of the protein 267) to allow direct ET. Small redox molecules can serve as 
exogenous mediators to shuttle the electrons via MET 79. Redox mediators , which undergo  
reversible redox reaction, can be physio logical redox partners such as cytochromes  or ferredoxins,  
or artificial molecules including ferrocene derivatives, ferricyanide, conducting organic salts  (for 
example, tetrathiafulvalene ( TTF)74 and mixed -valence viologen sal t270, etc.) , quinone 
45 
 compounds, transition -metal complexes, phenothiazine and phenoxazine compounds  205. To 
enable ET to occur , the redox potential of the mediator should be higher than that of the cofactor 
of the oxidi zing enzyme  (the opposite is true for the reducing enzyme ) 125. The selected  mediators 
should also  be stable  in both oxidized and reduced form , access the cofactor in an efficient 
manner  and undergo fast and reversible redox reaction on the electrode surface . Enzyme 
orientation is not a primary issue  for MET based bioelectrode construction . For membrane -less 
EFCs, mediators must be co-immobilized with enzymes  together  on the  electrode . To attain  this 
goal, p olymers bearing redox molecul es on their backbones 120,271,272 are widely used , however , 
raising performance -degrading  273 and possible toxicity issues due to the potential  leakage  of the 
polymer . The possible toxicity issue  from the redox polymer leakage  has not been well studied  
and comprehensively understood . Recent reports  find that some Os com plexes with finely -tuned 
chelating ligands  show  comprable cyto toxic ity to the clinical drugs274. Moreover, most polymer 
backbones are biocompatible and is unlikely to harm the body even after leakage into the body. 
The a dvantages o f redox polymers in acting as O 2 scavengers will be further discussed in 
sub-section  5.1. Meanwhile, Gross et al. recently reported the use of freely diffusing redox -active 
carbohydrate nanoparticles as redox mediators for homogeneous electron transfer with enzymes 
in solution275. This concept was illustrated via a biocathode based on 
2,2'-azino -bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline -6-sulphonic  acid) (ABTS) -nanoparticles and BOD. An 
example of this type of EFC avoid ing the need for surface immobilization at the electrode  was 
recently illustrated with GOx and BOD electrically wired by redox organic glyconanoparticles  
with entrapped quinone and thiazoline redox mediators, respectively .276 
 
The comparison between the DET and MET currents for MCOs can be used to determine  the 
percentage of enzymes with an orientation  that is unfavorable  for DET236. As illustrations , the 
addition of free ABTS  as the redox mediator increased the current density by 20% and 24% for 
Lac and BOD  modified  electrodes, respectively , emphasizing  the optimal control  of the 
proximity of enzymes ’ cofactor for facilitated DET255. In another study , only approximately 9% 
of BOD immobilized on hierarchical carbon felt modified with CNTs was electro -active67. It 46 
 should be noted that a freel y-diffusing mediator was used in these examples, with potential issues 
for the rate of diffusion of the mediator itself making it potentially difficult to evaluate the 
portion of enzyme in an orientation suitable for DET . Furthermore, e xamination  of the 
DET/MET ratio demonstrated  that this poor electroactive proportion was linked to unsuccessful 
direct enzyme wiring. On the anode side , it has been shown that Os redox polymer  encapsulating  
CDH permitted a higher MET current density than that of DET , which can arise from a  lower 
ratio of DET active enzymes277.  
 
For DET -based bioelectrodes , the surface coverage of active enzymes is generally of a 
monolayer on the electro de. In such cases, modification of the electrode surface and the use of 
high-surface area electrode s is used to obtain significant currents100. In contrast, using mediator s 
allows multilayered enzymes to be “electroactive” , resulting in  high current densit ies. A direct 
proof o f this is the successful  concept of electrostatic layer -by-layer  (LBL)  assembly of enzymes 
with redox polymer s 278-280. Electrostatic LBL assembly of redox enzymes and oppositely 
charged polyelectrolytes enables rapid ET, tuneable modification layers . However, t he faradaic 
response o f redox polymers themselves, alongside with the biocatalytic performance, does not 
increase linearly  with increasing number of assembled layers, indicative of a limit ation i n the 
number of  layer s in order  for the outermost layers to be electrochemically ad dressable , as well as 
limited mass transfer  rates within a relatively thick polymer layer280.  
 
A recent report combined orientation and mediation strategies to  enhance the performance of a 
Lac-based biocathode281. A molecular wire was synthesized, which contained an 
enzyme -orientation site (pyrene) to be plugged into the hydrophobic pocket of Lac, an electron 
redox mediator (A BTS) and a pyrrole monomer to be polymer ized onto electrode surface. This 
combined approach  resulted in  the highest maximum current density (2.5 mA cm-2) in 
comparison to the optimal  oriented (1.4 mA cm-2), mediated (2 mA cm-2) and physically 
adsorbed approaches  (0.6 mA cm-2). Coupled with a Pt alloy/C based anode, the optimized 
hydroge/air fuel cell provided a P max of 7.9 mW cm-2 (limited by the cathode) . 47 
 3.4 Employment of nanomaterials  
Implementation of high -specific -surface -area nanomaterials includi ng porous gold and porous 
carbon electrodes as enzyme support s is a widely used strategy for enhancing  current 
density88,92,103. Conductive materials with h igh surface -to-volume ratio s enable  high enzyme 
loading  87. For DET enzymes, even though they may be  randomly distributed in the conductive 
matrix, 3D nanomaterials provide the opportunity for  favourable  enzyme  wiring  for DET  282. 
Moreover, the confinement effects of the porous electrodes are of advantage in  the efficient 
coupling of enzymes282,283 and redox polymers modified surface283, in comparison to planar 
electrodes  (Figure 7).

application of EFC. Reprinted with permission  114. Copyright  2018  Elsevier.  
 
Porous gold electrodes featuring good electrical conductivity, chemical stability and 
biocompatibility can be fabricated by dealloying282,284,285, Au nanoparticle (AuNP) assembly  
75,286 -289, anodization290, or hard-291-293 and soft -294 template method s. Au electrode s can be easily 
modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols242,295, diazonium grafting283,296,297 and 
electropolymerization298,299 for enzyme immobilization to achieve direct and mediated ET. A 
dealloyed porous gold (thickness: 100 nm, pore size: 30 nm, roughness factor: 9) based EFC 
utilizing electrodeposited Os -complex modified polymer with BOD and GDH, repectively, 
showed a P max of 1.3 µW cm-2 in the presence of 20 mM glucose, in contrast to 0.08 µW cm-2 
48 
 using  planar Au electrodes283. When the same amount s of enzyme /Os-complex modified 
polymer were drop -cast onto electrodes300, the CDH/BOD based EFC in 5 mM lactose displayed 
41 and 13 µW cm-2 on dealloyed porous and planar gold electrodes, respectively.  Such a 
difference arises from the larger surface area of the porous electrode. Highly ordered 
microporous gold electrodes assembled by AuNPs were utilized to immobilize GDH and Lac at a 
bioanode an d biocathode respectively , and exhibited a P max of 178 µW cm-2  in 30 mM glucose, 
in comparison with 12.6 µW cm-2 on flat electrodes301. This increase in power density was mainly 
attributed to the high er enzyme loading  in microporous gold . Coupling a MWCNT/GDH based 
bioanode with a 3D microporous gold/Lac biocathode  displaying high DET current densiti es 
resulted in a P max of 56 µW cm-2 in 10 mM glucose, while 7 µW cm-2 was obtained when a planar 
Au/Lac biocathode was used286. These reports highlighted the enhancement of the power density 
observed with porous gold electrodes.  The p ore size , inversely proportional to the  specific 
surface area 282,302, is an important factor for the performance of the bioelectrode.  An optimal 
DET current for BOD was observed on porous gold electrodes with a pore size of ca. 20 nm 
which was large enough to accommodat e the enzyme  while providing a high surface area for 
sufficient enzyme loading 283.  
 
Examination of  values of Pmax greater than  1 mW cm-2 (Table 1) indicates that the majority  of 
high-power -density EFCs are based  on carbon nanomaterials  (CNMs) -based electrodes . CNMs 
including buckypaper  46,117,303, carbon felt  74, carbon c loth, carbon black  16, CNT s 62,72,303 -313, 
carbon fiber  65,273,314 -318, grap hene 73,93,255,319, porous carbon 11,63,66,320,321, carbon nanodots 322, and 
their combinations  thereof15,35,185,323 -327 have been widely used  for the preparation  of bioelectrodes . 
They  enjoy advantages including low cost,  affordable industrial  scalabil ity, wide operating 
potential window , chemical stability, hierarchical micro/nanostructures  and flexible structures . 
The high specific  surface  area of CNMs ensures high loading s of enzyme s 67. For example, the 
modification of graphite electrode with hydrophobic carbon nanofibers ( CNFs , BET surface area: 
131 m2 g-1) resulted in a 1500 -fold increase in the active area , so that  a high current  density of  4.5 
mA cm-2 (100-fold increase) was obtained for enzymatic H 2 oxidation  328. Graphene coated  3D 49 
 micropillar arrays  were used to immobilize GOx and Lac, respectively, allowing  an EFC with a 
Pmax of 136 µW cm-2 in 100 mM glucose, much higher  than a bare carbon based cell (22 µW 
cm-2)329. As discussed previously in Section 3.3, varying  the surface properties enables  the 
electrostatic interactio ns between the enzyme and the electrode , resulting in  the optimal  preferred  
enzyme orientation  for DET , and possible covalent attachment . CNMs are very attractive for that 
purpose. Versatile  surface modification methods  are based on  diazonium  salt reduction 255,330 -332, 
electropolymerization  333,334 and pyrene based π-stacking interactions 185,335 -337. One example is 
that a H 2/air EFC show ed a P max of 12 μW cm-2 when the hydrogenase and BOD were randomly 
adsorbed on pyrolytic graphite ( PG) electrode, in contrast to 119 μW cm-2 using  functionnalized  
pyrenyl MWCNTs 254. By replacing PG  with SWCNT -COOH, 35 and 300 fold increase s in the 
hydrogenase -bioanode and BOD -biocathode currents, repectively, have been reported 338. 
Accordingly, the P max of the result ant H2/O2 EFC attained to a value of 300 µW cm-2, much 
higher than that for  the cell based on PG (1 µW cm-2)338. 
 
CNMs are versatile and can be used in various formats81, allowing the miniaturization of EFCs 
towards implantable applications  with significant volumetric power densities.  Pioneering work  
by Heller et al. demonstrated a glucose/O 2 EFC consisting of two 7 -µm diameter and 2 -cm long 
carbon fibers, which delivered a maximum power density of 137 µW cm-2 (estimated to be 10 
µW cm-3 in volumetric power density  normalized to the whole cell size) at 37 C339. The 
implantation of this miniaturized EFC into a grape containing more than  30 mM glucose 
registered a maximum power density of 240 µW cm-2 (ca. 1 8 µW cm-3 in volumetric power 
density) when the cathode fiber was near the grape skin340. A glucose/O 2 EFC with a needle 
bioanode inserting into a rabbit ea r using ketjenblack as the electrode material produced a 
volumetric power density of ca. 42 µW cm-3 (estimated by the volume of the sealing tip: 0.01 
cm-3)341. A functional  and implantable glucose/O 2 EFC in a freely moving rat based on graphite 
particles electrodes was reported i n 2010 , featuring a size of 0.13 cm-3 and a volumetric power 
density of ca. 24.4 µW cm-3 (excluding the volume of the encapsulating bag)31. Crespilho et al. 
constructed a miniaturize glucose/O 2 EFC made with flexible carbon fiber microelectrodes 50 
 (length ca. 0.05 cm; diameter  ca. 10 µm ) modified with enzyme and mediator and implanted into 
the jugular vein of a living rat, yielding a maximum power d ensity of 95 µW cm-2 342. 
 
Althou gh allowing  significantly improved current densit ies, two main challenges of using CNMs 
based high -surface -area electrodes need to be  addressed. Firstly, t he potential toxicity  of CNMs  
343 particularly in implantable applications , needs to be considered344. Since d irect in vivo  contact 
should be circumvent ed, biocompatible polymer s can be used to avoid biofouling341. When used 
in portable device s, the possible dispersion of CNMs into the environment  may cause chronic 
diseases with long -term exposure time345. Secondly, fuel diffusion limitation s can arise at  high 
enzyme loading s67,346. Open, hierarchical  porous carbon materials with macropores for improved 
mass transport and mesopores with nanostructured  surface for efficient  enzyme -electrode 
communication are  promising320,321. A study of the pore size effect of MgO -templated carbon on 
the performance of [NiFe] -hydrogenase showed that larger pores (15 0 nm) afforded enhanced 
current density than small pores (35 nm) due to the  more  favourable enzyme loading  in the large 
pores347. 
3.5 Gas diffusion bioelectrode  
Mass transport plays a vital role in the power output of EFCs. For gaseous fuel -powered EFCs , 
gas diffusion bioelectrodes may overcome the substrate diffusion issue  as the consumed substrate  
(e.g. H2 and O 2) in the electrolyte will be compensated from the gas phase . The concentration of 
O2 available in aqueous solutions at room temperature is less than 1 mM , limiting  power output 
to only a few mW cm-2 79 for EFCs based on oxygen -reducing cathodes . In the case of 
hydrogenase -based bioanodes, modeling of substrate diffusion showed that a thickness limited to 
100 µm of porous carbon material was catalytically active , mainly restricted because of fast 
substrate depletion in the inner layers67. Therefore, the gas diffusion bioelectrode (GDBE) is 
envisioned  as a type of porous electrodes allowing the direct contact with gaseous substrates, 
eliminating the supply limitations due to the relatively low  subst rate solubility 102. The concept of 
GDBE emanates from developments in conventional fuel cell s. A viable GDBE consist s of 51 
 (Figure 8):102 i) a catalytic layer comprising enzymes, carbon additives for improved 
conductivity, binders for enhanced attachment and tuning the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity 
balance and ET mediators if necessary; ii) a porous and conductive catalytic support layer such 
as carbon paper348, carbon cloth349, carbon felt50 etc.; iii)  a protective layer  that is gas permeable  
and prevents leakage of the liquid electrolyte , for example Nafion ® 350 and 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)351,352.

Initial attempt s in using oxygen -reducing GDBEs w ere conducted by Tarasevich  et al. in 2003 by 
immobilizing Lac at highly dispersed colloidal graphite or acetylene carbon black353. Additional  
reports using ferricyanide mediated O2 reduction by BOD  in 2009  52, a GDBE using multi -copper 
oxidase undergoing DET in 2009  348, and  Lac undergoing DET350 have been described . In 
pioneering work Atanassov’s lab  described  a range of GDBEs based on MvBOD354 and Lac355-357 
adsorbed on hydrophobized carbon black composite, and Lac on MWCNTs358. High catalytic 
52 
 current densities were reported based on GDBE not only for O 2 reduction but also for other 
gaseous substrate enzymatic transformation such as CO 2  reduction270 or H 2 oxidation16,68,69. The 
reduction of N 2 into ammonia has been possible153, which could also be developed into a gas 
diffusion type electrode. Recent examples de monstrate steady -state catalytic current densities at 
water -repellent -treated porous carbon  felt/MvBOD bioelectrode  as high as 24 and 32 mA cm-2 
using  air and oxygen , respectively351. A highly gas -permeable water -proof carbon cloth/hollow 
MWCNTs/ MvBOD displayed a DET based catalytic current density of 32 mA cm-2 under 
atmospheric oxygen conditions153. On the anode  side, the first use of GDBE for H 2 oxidation was 
published in 2014 based on  Hydrogenovibrio marinus  [NiFe] -hydrogenase  undergoing DET 359. 
A H2/O2 EFC based on DET and dual GDBEs  deliver ed a P max of 8.4 mW cm-2 at 0.7 V under 
quiescent conditions , the highest value ever reported for such device68. More recently, a dual 
GDBE -based H 2/O2 EFC was constructed based on O 2-sensitive hydrogenase incorporated in 
redox polymers and BOD directly wired  to carbon cloth69. A maximum power density of 3.6 mW 
cm-2 was obtained, one of the highest value s ever reported for an EFC  (Table  1)69. Beside EFC 
applications, GDBEs  are also promising for applications in bioelectrosynthesis. The reduction of 
CO 2 to formate using MET -type GDBEs with tungsten -containing FoDH showed a current 
density of 17 mA cm-2 360.  
 
Special care has been paid to the architecture of GDBEs allowing these high catalytic 
performance s. Bio-triple -phase boundary  (BTPB) is the interface between a gaseous fuel, liquid 
electrolyte (buffer solution) and solid electrode, at which the catalytic reaction occurs102. The 
active enzymes need to be hydrated to enable catalytic activity , highlighting the importance of 
tuning the surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties102. The reduction of O 2 at the 
air-breathing biocathode  nicely illustrate s the main issues associated with GDBEs. Biocatalytic 
O2 reduction  involves  the following steps: i) O 2 from the gas phase is dissolved in the thin liquid 
layer  around the enzymes, ii) O 2 and protons diffusing fro m the electrolyte meet at the active site 
of the enzyme with production  of H 2O, iii) excess water is repelled by the hydrophobic surface 
enabling  the reaction to continue. An accumulation of water at the biocathode affects the final 53 
 performance of the GDBEs over time  as the flow of gases is impeded . A subtle optimization of 
the hydration level at the BTPB is of importance to ensure the water content is  sufficiently  high 
for efficient proton transfer in the liquid phase, and sufficiently low to ensure adequate  gas 
permeab ility at the interface.  In practice, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance of GDBEs 
can be optimized by adjusting the hydrophilic binder/ hydrophobic carbon additive ratio68,348. 
Besides biocathode flooding , local pH change at  BTPB  also resulted  in decreased operational 
stability  of GDBEs102, which can be alleviated by u sing concentrated buffer solutions52. 
Quantitative stability performance of various GDBEs has been described in a recent review102. 
The observed decay  in the current density can be  related to changes in  
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity arising from increased  water flooding and decreased gas 
permeability.  Atanassov et al. combined  oxygen -reducing GDBEs with paper based lateral -flow 
microfluidic systems by immobilizing enzymes with carbon based inks on nitrocellulose paper361, 
which broadened the range  of applications of EFCs , such as microfluidic paper -EFC stacks362-364. 
 
It should be noted that GDBEs are not suitable for implantable EFCs since gaseous substrates  are 
not substantially available in the body , but can be feasible  in subcutaneous devices341. Future 
efforts should be devoted to optimizing  the utilization level s of the immobilized enzyme , since 
the widely -used enzyme/binder/additive slurry  casting  method  maybe not sufficient enough. New 
strategies to engineer the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance  of the gas permeability and 
porosity  should be developed.  For example, a gold coated porous anodi c alumina (PAA) , whose 
surface wettability can be tailored by the properties of self -assembled monolayers,  has been 
recently used for GOx immobilization (Figure 9)365. It is found that O 2 can participate to the 
enzymatic reaction directly from the gas phase through  the channels, resulting in a n 80-fold 
increase compared with that of an immersion type electrode.

3.6 Fluidic  EFC s 
Fluidic configuration is one hydrodynamic strategy  to overcom e substrate depletion  and thus 
increase the power density . EFCs in implanted medical devices use sugars and oxygen available 
under physiologically ambient conditions in soft tissue or blood vessels  5. The surrounding tissue 
leads to additional resistance for mass transport of reactants and waste products. In contrast, 
EFCs implanted in blood vessels can be regarded as flow -through devices with  mass transport 
improved in the  blood st ream which has a  flow velocity of 1 -10 cm s-1 5. A wide  range of recent 
studies has used a  combination of enzymatic micro fluidic  devices to mimic the flow conditions 
in blood vessels350,366. Initial attempts focus ed on flowing enzyme367-369 and/or cofactor370 and/or 
mediator371 solutions into micro -channels,  where  enzyme immobilization is essential350. 
Immobilization methods such as electrostatic interaction  76,372,373, covalent bon ding294,371 and 
cross -linking374,375 will be discussed further in Section 4.1.  
 
One interesting example is a hybrid microfluidic fuel cell based on a GOx bioanode and an 
air-exposed Pt/C cathode  375. At a flow rate of  0.5 mL h-1 (under  laminar flow ), the fuel cell 
exhibited a decrease in  Pmax from 0.6 to 0.2 mW cm-2 when tested in buffer and human blood 
respectively.  The d ecrease  was proposed  to be a consequences of higher viscosity and  the 
adsorption of chemical species , including  protein fragments , onto the electrode surface.  A single 
compar tment lactate/O 2 EFC in a pH 5.6 buffer containing 40 mM lactate registered a P max of 
61.2 μW cm-2, which was increased to 305 μW cm-2 when operated at 3 mL h-1 in a microfluidic 
configuration 376. The power density increased further on raising the flow rate to 9 mL h-1, but 
levelled off at 12 mL h-1 indicating that the response is likely due to flow -induced instabilities in 
the enzym e immobilization, as explained by the authors 376. Porous  carbon paper has been 
introduced into a co -laminar microfluidic ethanol/O 2 EFC 377. In this case, a low flow rate (50 µL 55 
 min-1) generated higher power density than  that from a higher flow rate (10 0 µL min-1), a result 
that can arise from the longer residence times in the enzyme layer at lower flow rates.

Pankratov  et al. prepared a tubular graphite electrode  with inner and outer diameters of 1.00 and 
3.01 mm , respectively,  sizes that  resemble  that of  a vein 378. CDH and BOD were  used to modify 
the inner tubular surface to form  a bioanode and biocathode respectively.  The tube was operated 
ex vivo  with a laminar flow of blood from a human volunteer under homeostatic conditions.  
Experimental  data, as well as theoretical calculations , showed that the power density of such an 
EFC was dependent on fuel concentration and blood flow rate  (Figure 10). 
 
Detachment arising from hydrodynamic flow , however , hindered the long-term operation of the 
bioelectrode, highlighting the importance of robust anchoring of enzymes to electrode surfaces. 
Specifically, poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) cross -linked enzyme layers could 
be washed off by the fluid at a flow rate of 0.2 mL h-1 371. In contrast, covalently bound enzymes 
appeared to be much more resistant towards flow at 2 mL h-1 371. The response of a  hybrid fuel 
cell using a GOx /MWCNTs  anode and a Pt/carbon cathode was tested in human blood at a flow 
rate of 0.5 mL h-1, decreased by  over 65% after 3 h of operation  375. Gonzalez -Guerrero et al. 
56 
 described  a pyrolyzed photoresist film (PPF) electrode based EFC employing a 
ferrocenium -based PEI linked GOx anode  and MWCNTs/ Lac cathode that displayed a decreased 
in power density of 50% after 24 h of operation at a flow rate of 4.2 mL h-1 in buffer solution374.  
 
The Reynolds number is a measurement of degree of  convective mixing of co -laminar streams350. 
In microfluidic channels, the Reynolds number is low, and mixing of the adjacent flow ing 
streams  is limited to a very thin interfacial width. Careful adjust ment  of the dimensions of these 
microchannels can avoid the need for a  physical barrier to separate the fuel and the oxidant. 
Ion-exchange membranes are typically used to avoid  mixing of  H2 and O 2 and to limit exposure 
to O2 inactivation of hydrogenases88. A Y -shape microfluidic channel369 with co -laminar flow s of 
H2 and O 2 enriched solution could eliminate the need for separati on membranes , while ensuring 
rapid rates of transport of the substrates . 
 
Other hydrodynamic environments introduced by magnetic stirring273, electrode rotation230,287 and 
flow cell33,294 are widely used to compensate for diffusion limitations in order to increas e the 
power output of a EFC.  However, the additional power , sometimes even greater than that  
generated by the EFC itself , is usually required, making the se stirred and rotated EFCs  
impractical.  
3.7 Combined EFC s/(super )capacitor devices  
The energy  generated in EFCs can be stored in energy storage devices in a ‘stationary ’ mode . 
Rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are the  most widely studied energy storage devices, 
and can store and release electrical energy by electrochemical reactions  379. Supercapacitors, also 
known as electrochemical capacitors, utilize the electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC) via 
ion adsorption or pseudocapacitance attained during  reversible faradaic reactions 379. Unlike 
EFCs suffering from low power density and stability, supercapacitors possess high specific 
power density and long lifetime . A range of reports have combined  EFCs with 
(super )capacitors140. 57 
  
Initial attempts focussed on the external conn ection of EFCs with capacitors or supercapacitors. 
The coupled  capacitor element accumulates the charge generated by the EFCs in the circuit, 
which can be released by output pulses with much higher power densities than that possible by 
EFCs themselves.  Skunik -Nuckowska et al.  used MWCNT based supercapacitors  in parallel as 
complementary power unit s coupled with  a Lac cathode and zinc anode based biobattery . The 
biobattery alone delivered a power output of 1.3 µ W, in comparison to 8.5 mW from the 
biobattery/supercapacitor hybrid system 380. Sode et al. developed  the concept of a “BioCapacitor” 
by integrating  an EFC with a charge pump/capacitor combination  (Figure  11) 139,381. The 
capacitor was gradually charged and then discharged to power the electric device 139. The 
high-power  levels generated resulted in  very short discharge intervals.  A similar setup was used 
to design a wireless sensor fed by a H 2/O2 EFC 382. The conce ntration  of fuel  determines the rate 
of ch arge/discharge of the biocapacitor , which enables a self -powered biosensor to determine the 
concentration of the fuel via the  rate of  charge/discharge of the capacitor 139. Liu et al. coupled  
two series -connected glucose/O 2 EFCs consisting of a buckypaper/MWCNT/FAD -GDH 
bioanode  and a buckypaper/MWCNT/Lac biocathode  with a flexible all -solid-state 
supercapacitor 303. The self -charged system achieve d a P max of 608 μW cm-2 when the capacitor 
was discharged , 90% higher than the  value for series -connected EFCs.

voltage of the EFC and a capacitor is used to store the electrical energy. The stored electric 
58 
 energy can be discharged from the capacitor to activate a device (e.g. a LED bu lb) when the 
capacitor voltage attains to the set value.  Reprinted with permission  139. Copyright 2018 Elsevier.  
 
Closer examination of the configuration of EFCs and supercapacitors indicate that i) two 
electrodes hosting active materials (namely the anode and cathode) connected to the external 
circuit; ii) an electrol yte solution with conducting ions; iii) a separator if necessary to prevent 
possible short -circuit.  Carbon nanomaterials that are widely  used for  the preparation of 
bioelectrodes have significantly high EDLC. Agnès et al. developed an EFC consisting of a 
compressed porous CNT  matrix modified GOx bioanode and a Lac based biocathode, delivering 
3 mA and 2 mW pulse s with a short duration of 10 ms per 10 s for 5 days in the presence of 
glucose and O 2 383. In this case, the electricity generated by the EFC was stored continuously in 
the EDLC of CNTs. In parallel, Pankratov et al. reported a hybrid device based on flat gra phite 
foil electrodes, with one face bearing an EFC using an AuNPs -CDH bioanode and an 
AuNPs -BOD biocathode, and the other face configured with capacitive materials 
(CNT/polyaniline)  384. It displayed an initial power output of 1.2 mW cm-2 at a voltage of 0.38 V  
which is 170  times higher than that of  the EFBC alone.  
 
It should be clarified  that a biodevice simultaneously function ning as an EFC and a 
supercapacitor is different from systems based on  the external connection of an EFC to a 
(super)capacitor. The form er can be termed a hybrid EFC/supercapacitor device, which can be 
prepared from bifunctional electrodes140,385. The integration of such systems enables 
miniaturization. The self -powered capacitor functions in a sequence of charging  and 
discharg ing283,386. Under charging conditions , the cell is at open-circuit, and t he open -circuit 
potential (OCP) between the two electrodes gradually increases  to the open-circuit voltage ( OCV ) 
of the EFC, as a result of  the higher potential on the biocathode catalyzing oxygen reduction and 
the lower potential at the bioanode catalyzing the oxidation of fuels.  Such a potential difference 
drives the polarization of the capacitive biocathode and bioanode.  In other words, the capacitive 
cell is electrostatically charged by the biocataly tically  induced potential difference. In the 
discharge step, the accumulated charge can be released at a fixed  resistance384 or current 59 
 density283. Based on such a methodology, Kizling et al. reported a  fructose/O 2 
EFC/supercapacitor hybrid device comp osed of a cellulose/polypyrrole/FDH bioanode387,388 and 
a naphthylated CNTs/Lac biocathode388. Three  biodevice s in a series could  generate pulses for 45 
s with potentials above 1 V.  Villarrubia et al. prepared a buckypaper  based glucose/O 2 
EFC/supercapacitor hybrid device364, which  could be self -charged and discharged by a  range of  
current densit ies as high as 4 mA cm-2 for 0.01 s with a P max of 0.87 mW cm-2 (absolute  
maximum power: 10.6 mW), 10  times  higher than that of the EFC itself.  
 
In addition to carbon nanomaterials with high EDLC, the pseudocapacitance behavior of redox 
polymers has also been examined . Knoche et al. prepared a hybrid device consisting of a carbon 
felt/MWCNT/dimethylferrocene -modified linear poly(ethylenimine) (FcMe 2-LPEI)/FAD -GDH 
bioanode and a biocathode based on a carbon felt/anthracene terminated MWCNT/BOD 389. The 
FcMe 2-LPEI  redox poly mer served as mediator, enzyme immobilization matrix and as a 
supercapacitor whose pseudo -capacitance increased with polymer loading. The device generate d 
1 mA pulses for 1 s with a power output of 1 mW energy.  Pankratov et al. developed a capacitive 
EFC using the  same  Os-complex modified  polymer on a GDH anode and  a BOD cathode 378. 
The capacitance of the polymer was used for energy storage with an OCP up to 0.45 V, which 
could be dischar ged with 8-fold higher power  output than that obtained in steady state  378. Xiao et 
al. doped an Os-complex modified  polymer based FAD -GDH bioanode and a BOD cathode 
with poly(3,4 -ethyl enedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) that show ed enhanced capacitance 283. The 
hybrid device was charged by the internal  glucose/O 2 EFC and discharged as a supercapacitor at 
various current densities up to 2 mA cm-2 registering a P max of 60 9 μW cm-2, a 468-fold increase 
when  compared to that from the EFC itself.  Connection  of three devices in series produced 10 
μA for 0.5 ms at a frequenc y of 0.2 Hz, mimicking the power requirement of  a cardiac 
pacemaker.  Interestingly , Alsaoub et al. demonstrated that the pseudo -capacitance of 
Os-complex modified  polymers can be used in a so -called “biosupercapacitor” which can be 
discharged 390. However, such a biodevice , comprised of a high -potential Os complex modified  60 
 polymer for glucose oxidation and a low one for oxygen reduction , is not  an EFC  as it cannot 
provide a usable OCV.  
 
To briefly summarize this section, unconventional configuration s of EFCs enable  additional 
functionalities. However, as already discussed, the output voltage is still limited by the OCV of 
the EFC. The a rbitrary combination of EFC and supercapacitor may be problematic , as shared 
electrode s configuration may reduce  the efficiency of EFCs due to diffusion limitation.  Insulati ng 
biomolecules are unlikely to be very beneficial  for high -performance supercapacitors, although 
there are some  reports indicating  that proteins could contribute additional capacit ance391. 
Additional  research is needed to understand the mechanism of operation392,393 and to develop 
practical applications392 of hybrid devices.  
 
4. Strategies for improving stability in EFC s 
4.1 Enzyme immobilization approaches  
The primary consideration of immobilization upon the bioelectrode’s operational stability is to 
avoid enzyme detachment and other co-factors from the electrode76. Once immobilized,  enzymes 
usually exhibit extended lifetime compared to those in solution394. Rigidification of the str ucture  
of the enzyme can enhance  enzyme stability395. In EFCs, enzymes can be immobilized onto solid 
electrode surfaces by a range of approaches that include  physical  adsorption, covalent binding , 
entrapment and c ross-linking6,40,90,96,396 (Figure 12).  
 61 
  
Figure  12. Schem e of various enzyme immobilization methods for bioelectrode fabrication . 
 
Physical adsorption is generally considered as the simplest and mildest technique for enzyme 
immobilization, whereby enzymes are adsorb ed directly onto electrode surfaces. However , 
enzymes physically ad sorbed onto bare metal electrode surfaces often suffer from reduced 
operating  lifetime s.238 The self -assembly of a monolayer  of thiols  on the electrode surfac e may 
protect the enzymes from denaturation caused by metal -enzyme interaction s397 or at the electrode 
solution interface398. On the contrary, in comparison with planar electrodes , bioelectrode s 
fabricated by adsorbing enzymes at nanomaterials  often exhibit not only improved 
electrocatalytic  activity but also  improved operational stability.399-401 The improved activity and 
stability of nano -structure -based bioelectrode was ascribed to the 3D structure of the electrode, 
providing a mild microenvironment to effectively avoid enzyme desorption  and denaturation.402 
A glucose/O 2 EFC prepared by the physical adsor ption of  GOx and BOD onto hierarchical 
metal –oxide mesoporous electrodes showed only 10% loss in voltage output after 30 -h 
continuous operation.403 Furthermore, the effect of pore size of porous electrode s on the stability  
of bioelectrode was investigated321,347,404,405. AaHase adsorbed onto MgO -template d carbon 
(MgOC) with pore size of 35 nm (larger than the size of AaHase ca. 17.7  1.3 nm), exhibited a 
half-time of 81 h at 50 C, much longer  than that of  AaHase in solution (7  h) (Figure  13).347 A 
dialysis membrane (cut -off-molecular -weight of 12-14 kDa) was placed on  the electrodes to 
prevent  enzyme leakage  to the solution during the measurement . The enhanced stability was 
ascrib ed to interaction s between the pore materials and enzymes which  decreased the 
conformational  flexibility of the enzymes .347

The surface properties  of electrodes, such as hydrophobicity, surface charge or functionalized 
group s, can influence the stability of bioelectrodes406. TvLac adsor bed onto  1-pyrenebutyric acid 
adamantyl amide functionalized MWCNTs  (ADA -MWCNTs) remained 66% of the initial 
bioelectrocatalytic activity after 1 month259. However, TvLac on pristine MWCNT  exihibit ed 
rapid decrease in catalytic currents to less than  5% of the initial value after 20 days  (Figure 1 4). 
In this case, modifier with polycyclic aromatic structure can bind to  the active center pocket of 
the enzymes , diminishing the desorption of the enzyme and reduc ing the conformation al change s 
of enzymes259,407 ,70,408. A thermostable H 2/O2 EFC was assembled with an AaHase -based 
bioanode  and a BpBOD -based biocathode , which were fabricated by physically adsorb ing 
AaHase or BpBOD onto 1-pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride functionalized CNT electrodes , 
retained 95% of the initial power after 17  h continuous operation67. These reports suggest that  
functionalized surfaces  of electrode s are likely to  improve the stability of bioelectrodes by 
enhancing intermolecular  interaction  between enzymes and electrodes as well as  reducing the 
conformational disruption70,181,257,409 -411. Conformational changes of the enzyme s during operation 
of EFCs is an area that needs investigation.

Covalent binding  is a typical and effective enzyme immobilization method. Peripheral  amino or 
carboxyl ate groups on enzymes are feasible positions for covalent linkage.  One common 
approach to anchor enzymes onto electrode surfaces  is usually based on  the formation of amide 
bond s between carboxy lic groups and amino groups230,234,253,286,412 -414, which are  typically 
mediated by carboxylate activating reagents such as 
1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) . With  the aid of EDC, the MvBOD 
covalently bound to 6-mercaptohexanoic acid functionalized Au electrode retained more than 80% 
of the intial current after 4000 s continued measurement, while only 20% of the intial current was 
remained  at the MvBOD physically adsorbed 6 -mercaptohexanoic acid functionalized Au 
electrode (without EDC in this case).234 (Figure 15A , B) The covalent binding  between enzymes 
and electrodes is expected , for example, to prevent the enzyme  orientation changes, which , 
however , affect the interfacial ET and then the lifetime of bioelectrodes . Besides, “click 
chemistry” is a convenient method to covalent ly bind redox enzymes to electrode surfaces .263 A 
thiol-maleimide click reaction between MoBOD  variant S362C and maleimide -functionalized 
MWCNT was employed to construct a stable O2 bioanode, which retained ca. 95% of the initial 
current after 3 days storage , with ca. 30% of electrocatalytic current retained after 3 hours storage 
64 
 for an electrode prepared  by simp ly physical adsorption415. (Figure 15 C, D)  Compared to 
physical adsorption, covalent binding provides stronger degrees of interaction  between the 
enzymes and the electrode surface , leading to  higher stability  of the bioelectrodes416,417. However, 
it should be noted that the enzyme activity can decrease to certain extent upon immobili zation  
416,418,419.

It is a useful method to entrap enzymes in to polymer matrices or inorganic frameworks on the 
electrode surface for enzyme immobilization , which can  reduce the amount of leaching while 
65 
 avoiding  denatur ation and  conformation al change s to the enzyme.  Sol-gel based methods have 
been frequently reported to entrap enzymes with high activity and stability420-424. Entrapping  
redox enzymes into membrane -like matrices, such as  lipid, agarose and DNA -hydrogel, which 
can mimic the natural environment of enzymes, retain s enzymes in functionally active 
forms425-428. However, such matrices usually suffer from  poor conductivity , and cannot  be used 
directly for bioelectrocatalysis.  As a result , materials with high conductivity such as CNTs, and 
redox mediators such as ferricyanide and ABTS, are usually co -encapsulated. A stable current 
response was obtained at a bioelectrode fabricated by coating a mixture of chitosan, Lac and 
MWCNT for o ver 60 days’  continuous measurement , with more than 70% of the initial current 
retained upon storage for six months .429  
 
On the other hand, by directly using conductive materials including CNTs as matrices for 
encapsulation of enzymes, stable bioelectrodes with high electroactivity can be realized .59,71,430,431 
Cosnier and coworkers reproted a glucose/O 2 EFC by combining a  GOx -based bioanode and 
Lac-based biocathode, prepared by mixing  GOx or Lac with CNT,  that showed only a slight 
(4%) decrease in the maximum power density after 30 days storage in buffer solution  (Figure  
16)59. Recently, as novel matrices, metal organic fram eworks  (MOFs) have been reported to 
entrap  enzymes with long lifetimes432-436. A stable O2 reduction enzyme  electrode was 
prepared  by mixing  Lac with ABTS , mesoporous Fe(III) trimesate nanoparticle and carbon 
blacks433. With improved operating lifetime s, MOFs -based enzym e-electrodes are potentially 
of interest in the construction of EFCs . 66

Cross-linking is a simple and effective method to immobilize enzymes on electrode . High 
stability should be ex pected because the process is based on  bi- or multi -functional reagent  
ligands , forming rigid enzym atic aggregation , reducing leaching of the enzyme and  improving 
the stability.437,438 A stable peroxidase layer at ketjen black surface for DET -type 
bioelectrocatalysis  has been reported  by using g lutaraldehyde  as a cross -linker . In the absence of 
67 
 glutaraldehyde , however, the catalytic current decreased  with time and was lower  than that in the 
presence of gl utaraldehyde .439 On the other hand, considering that the enzyme and cross -linking 
agents can form covalent  bonds , the stability of the resul tant enzymatic bioelectrodes can be 
improved288,440 -442. With the aid of PEGDGE , a MET -type EFC using  covalently anchored  GOx 
and BOD, respectively at amino group -derivati zed bioanode and biocathode , retained 70% of the 
initial maximum power after 24 h, while just 10% retention was observed for the EFC based on 
underivatized graphite442. Furthermore, to avoid uncontrollable cro ss-linking reaction, 
Schu hmann’s group proposed a n electrochemical ly induced cross -linking  strategy to improve the 
operational  stability of enzymatic bioelectrode s by locally entrap ping enzymes into polymers  on 
electrode surfaces443-446. With high stability , reusability  as well as high volumetric activities, 
cross -linking represent s an alternative to conventional  immobili zation approaches on solid 
surface.447 However, a heterogeneous  enzyme orientation distribution may induce slower ET 
rates specially in case of the use of cross -linkers.  
4.2 Tuning enzyme properties  
4.2.1 Employing extremophile enzymes  
Biodiversity offers a large variety of microorganisms growing in extreme environments such as 
extreme pH18, high salinity448 or extreme temperatures. Exploiting enzymes fro m these 
microorganisms is still in its enfancy in the domain of EFCs, but may enhance the capabilities of 
EFCs to operate under broader operating condition s, while also potentially improving  the 
stability of the enzymes. The discovery and use of thermostable enzymes from thermophilic 
microorganisms are of great importance to increase enzyme stability and potentially decrease 
enzyme production cost by simpl ifying enzyme purification process  and extending enzyme 
duration  in the area of biomanufa cturing449. In EFCs, the same idea has been adopted to maintain 
the stability of the enzymatic catalysts and extend the lifetime of the fu el cells. Ohsaka et al. 
demonstrated the successful application of thermophilic GDH  and laccase in EFCs that could be 
operated at elevated temperatures (76 oC)450. Lojou et al. constructed an EFC employing a 68 
 hyperthermophilic O 2-tolerant hydrogenase and a thermostable BOD  with a maximum power 
output of 2.3 mW at 50 oC. The device delivered 15.8 mW h of of power after 17 h of  continuous 
operation67. An efficient membraneless air -breathing/H 2 EFC was assembled by Cosnier’s group 
relying on the same thermostable enzymes65,349. Comparison of two bioanodes constructed with 
the hyperthermophilic Aquifex aeolicus  and the mesophilic Ralstonia eutropha  hydrogenases 
clearly demonstrated the higher stability of the former not only at elevated temperature but also at 
room temperature335. Another NiFe hydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium 
Pyroccocus furiosus  showed a remaining activity at 80°C upon exposure to O 2, highlighting 
combined resistances of these extrem ophile enzymes451. A Sulfolobus kodaii  alcohol 
dehydrogenase was investigated for use as a biocatalyst for electrochemical applications by Ohno 
et al. The constructed bioanode can maintain a high current density at even 80 oC, with a 12 -fold 
increase over that at room temperature17. Recently, Zhang’s group developed several synthetic 
enzymatic pathway -catalyzed EFCs comprised of multiple therm ostable enzymes cloned from 
various thermophiles and capable of deeply or completely oxidizing sugar fuels. Such EFCs 
could be operated at 50 oC and exhibit an 8 -fold increase in power density compared to those 
based on mesophilic enzymes171,452.   
4.2.2 Protein  engineering  for better stability   
As discussed in previous sections, p rotein engineering approaches are mainly used to improve 
rates of  the ET between enzymes and electrodes453, tuning the substrate specificity of enzymes454, 
as well as creating scaffolds for enzyme immobilization105. General protein engineering strategies 
for biocatalysts in EFCs have been summarized in detail in two recent reviews196,455. More 
attention here will be paid on increasing the poor stability of EFCs. In detail, protein engineering 
can enable the stabilization of enzymes, by modifying the enzymes’ structures in order to 
introduce more strong  bonds , remove unfavorable steric effects, and remove potential 
degradation sites456. For example, a homodimeric pyrrolquinoline quinone GDH  from 
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus  was engineered by changing a single amino acid to cysteine, so that 
the lifetime of the EFC was greatly extended to 152 h, more than 6 -fold that of the EFC 69 
 employing the wild -type. Enhanced disulfide bond formation of the active enzyme dimer  may 
explain this result  457. Additional work demonstrated that the thermal stability could be increased 
by introducing a hydrophobic interaction in the interface of the two subunits in this enzyme 
through two amino acid substitutio ns 458. Direct evolution has been applied to  Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  Lac by introducing mutations in the second coordination sphere of T1 to increase the 
resistance to chloride ions, making it more suitable to be used for EFCs working in physiological 
fluids 459. It was also reported that protein oligom erisation is a potential  means of increasing the 
stability of the bioelectrode460. 
 
In addition to increasing the stability of engineered enzymes, other studies have focused on 
replacing expensive nicotinamide -based cofactors (NAD+ or NADP+) required in MET -based 
EFCs with inexpensive and stable biomimics. In order to use these biomimetic cofactors, the 
cofactor preference of the respective oxidoreductase has to be altered. For example, Banta et al. 
engineered an alcohol dehydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus  to utilize the biomimic cofactor 
nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) 461. Compared to natural cofactors, such biomimic 
cofactors are smaller with fas ter rates of  diffusion. In addition to  increases in stability, g ains in 
the performance of the NMN -mediated EFC were observed possibly due to improved rates of 
cofactor diffusion, despite a decreased turnover rate of the engineered enzyme. Zhang  et al. 
changed the cofactor specificity of 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from its natural cofactor 
NADP to NAD through a rational design strategy. The best mutant exhibited a ~60,000 -fold 
reversal of the cofactor selectivity from NADP to NAD, and the associated EFC possessed an 
increase in power density and enhanced stability at high temperature 462. Cofactor engineering not 
only can address the issue of unstable natural cofactors used in EFCs, but can also improve rates 
of mass transfer and the overall cost of EFCs.  70 
 4.3 Microbial surface displayed enzymes  as biocatalysts to enhance EFC s’ stability  
4.3.1 Microbial surface display  
Microbial surface display refers to the biotechnology  of introducing foreign peptides or 
proteins of interest on the surfaces of microb es by fusing them with appropriate anchoring 
protein motifs463,464, which is capable of ma intaining their relatively independent spatial 
structure and biological activity . The microbial surface display system is usually composed of 
a passenger protein (target protein), an anchor protein (carrier protein) and host microbes 
(Figure 17). To date, varying anchor proteins such as  ice nucleation protein (INP) 465, 
Lpp-OmpA466, EstA467, and OmpC468, OmpA469 have been used.  Microbial surfac e display is 
classified into phage display, yeast display and bacterial display, which enables foreign 
peptides or proteins to directly interact with substrate without passing through the outer 
membrane by means of genetic engineering. Moreover, this strat egy can help to improve the 
stability of displayed proteins due to the immobilization on the surface of biomaterial 
support470,471. So far, microbial surface display has been widely applied in live -vaccines472, 
peptide or protein library screening473, bioadsorbents474, whole -cell biocatalysts475 and 
biosensors  158,476.  71

membrane protein C, which is a representative example of sandwich fusion method. In this 
system, poly -histidine (poly -His) peptides of up to 162 amino acids could be inserted into the 
seventh external loop (L7) of OmpC and could be efficiently  exposed on the E. coli  cell 
surface. Reprinted  with permission.  463 Copyright 2003 Elsevier.  
4.3.2. Efficient EFC s based on microbial surface dis played enzyme as biocatalysts  
As the entire microbe is used as the whole -cell biocatalyst, the enzymes expressed on the cell  
surface can exhibit improved  stability when compared to that of  free enzymes472-475. Thus, 
EFCs using whole -cell biocatalyst  are expected to improve their performance, in particular in 
72 
 long-term operational stability.  Additionally, w ithout the need for enzyme purification, the 
enzyme -expressing  whole -cell based biocatalysts have also been used for the construction of 
EFCs477-479. Alfonta’s group displayed GOx on yeast cell surface using a-agglutinin as an 
anchor motif for EFC construction 477. The randomly distributed GOx showed interesting 
advantages over unmodifi ed yeast or purified GOx. Under the same condition, the engineered 
yeast based EFC showed  an increased OCV  of ca. 0.88 V in comparison to  ca. 0.73 V  for 
purified GOx. The improved performance was probably derived from the synergistic effect of 
both the GOx  on the yeast surface and the imobilization of the metabolic output of the yeast 
cells for power production. It should be mentioned here that the microbe mainly serves as a 
stabilizing element 479, different from  MFCs which utilize an entire microorganism (also 
called electricigens) to convert the chemical energy of organic matter for electricity480-482. 
Recently, d ehydrogenases have attracte d significant attention as the  reaction s are not affected 
by the presence of oxygen. Liu  et al. have described a number of reports  on dehydrogenases , 
with xylose dehydro genase (XDH)483, GDH484,485, glutamate dehydrogenase486 and FoDH487 
being successfully displayed on the surface of E. Coli.  Biosensors483,486,488 -491 and 
one-compartment biofuel cells286,492,493 have been prepared using these surface displayed 
dehydrogenase s. Direct energy conversion from xylose was successfully achieved using XDH 
surface displayed E. coli  (XDH -bacteria) based EFC, composed of XDH -bacteria 
immobilized on poly(brilliant cresyl blue )(PBCB)/MWCNTs modified glassy carbon 
electrode (GCE) (XDH -bacteria/PBCB/MWCNTs/GCE) based bioanode and a free BOD 
based biocathode492. Under optimized condition, a P max of 63 μW cm-2 at 0.44 V was obtained, 
60% higher than that of the free enzyme based EFC492 (Figure  18). It is noteworthy that this 
EFC could retain 85% of its maximal power after 12 h of continuous operation . A rational ly 
design ed XDH mutant NA -1 with i mproved thermostability was anchored on the bacterial 
surface493. After  12 h operation, 88% of its maximal power was retained493. In another report , 
a bacterial surface displayed GDH mutant (mutant -GDH -bacteria) was immobilized  onto 
MWCNTs as bioanode286. This EFC showed a P max of 55.8 μW cm-2 at 0.45 V and an OCV of 
0.80 V in 10 mM glucose. The as -fabricated EFC retained 84% of P max even after continuous 73 
 operation for 55 h, benefi tting from the high stability of the bacterial displayed GDH 
mutant286.

Sequential enzyme s refer to two or more enzymes involved in  catalyz ing cascade reaction s 
sequentially and coordinately , for example,  glucoamylase  (GA) /GOx , ADH/FDH , and GOx / 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) . Recently, EFCs based on sequential enzymes raised great 
interests. For  instance , a membraneless starch/O 2 EFC based on bioanode by co -immobilizing 
commercial GA and GOx 494 as well as white rice/O 2 EFC based on the multi -immobilization 
of GOx, alpha amylase and GA on a carbon paste electrode 495, was developed . Nevertheless, 
it is complicated to co -immobilize two or three enzymes at the same time, as the spatial 
orientation of the enzymes cannot be controlled. Alfonta et al. displayed GA and GOx on 
yeast surface, respectively, to obtain GA -yeast and GOx -yeast, and then constructed a 
two-chamber EFC 496. However, the P max was only about 3 µW cm-2, probably due to the low 
catalytic efficiency arisi ng from the spatial barrier between GA and GOx. The same group 
74 
 further  co-expressed ADH and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FormDH)  on yeast cells using 
cohesin -dockerin interaction s173. Subsequently,  an EFC was fabricated using the displayed 
ADH/ FormDH  cascade based bioanodes and copper oxidase based biocathodes, however, a 
low power density (< 3 µW cm-2) was achieved173 because the surface patterning of the 
enzymes together with their orientation were not considered.  It should be mentioned here that , 
the controlled  co-displayed cascade enzymes should be superior to random ly displayed  
cascade enzymes  as the enzyme cascades assembled on the cell would enable reactants to 
transfer between active sites of the enzymes efficiently, which makes great sense in 
biocatalysis and bioelectro -synthesis . 
4.4 Strategies for enzyme protection against O 2 and reactive oxygen species  (ROS ) 
While oxygen is the oxidant mainly used as the cathod ic substrate in EFCs  where it is reduced to 
water,  it can s eriously affect the performance  of the anode in EFCs if operating in a single 
compartment configuration . Reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as O2.-), produced by the  
incomplete reduction  of O2, can seriously affect the activity of enzymes. The majority of 
sugar /O2 based EFCs rely on flavoprotein  oxidases  (e.g. GOx and lactate oxidase ( LOx)) 
carrying a flavin  cofactor tethered in the protein  that utilize s O2 as an electron acceptor , 
producing H2O2 in the process497,498. The response of biosensors499 that rely on DET or MET 
generally do es not detect H 2O2 which can have a  deleterious  effect on the enzymes  in the system  
500,501. Scodeller et al. found  that e xogenous peroxide  reduce d the electrocatalytic O 2 reduction 
current at an Os-complex modified  polymer mediated Trametes trogii Lac biocathode  by ca. 20 % 
502. H2O2 irreversibly  inhibit ed the activity of a biocathode with immobilized Myrothecium sp . 
BOD , whereas  a reversib le deleterious  effect was found  with TvLac 503. The underling 
mechanism of inhibition is still un clear.  
 
In the case of implantable EFCs, the generation of H2O2 is also undesirable  as it is toxic to the 
surrounding tissue  3. Removal of H2O2 can be achieved via catalytic  decomposition by catalase 
31,34,41,383 on the bioanode. It should be noted that there are EFCs based on H 2O2-reducing 75 
 biocathodes  504-507. For example, GOx can catalyze the oxidation of glucose producing H 2O2, 
which is electroenzymatically reduced in to water by immobilized peroxidases 333.  
 
Re-engineering  of oxygen -sensitive flavoprotein  oxidases reduce s the effect of  oxygen508. The 
conversion  of O 2 into H 2O2 involves two electrons and two protons transfer red from th e reduced 
flavin  509. The active site  binding pocket  of AnGOx  contains  Glu412, His516, His559, and FAD  
510. His516 in the active site of native GOx is protonated and positively charged and is likely 
responsible for the electrostatic stabilization of the transition state  for stepwise single -electron 
transfer  between FADH- and O 2 511. The replacement of  His516 by alanine  by site-directed 
mutagenesis resulted in a 217 -fold decrease in kcat/KM(O2) at pH 5 511. Gutierrez  et al. identified 
four oxygen/mediator (quinone diimine) activity related positions in AnGOx, which were close to 
the FAD domain and situated at the oxygen entry 512. Simultaneous site saturation at the four 
positions by two rounds of directed evolution and ultra high-throughput screening resulted  in a 
37-fold decreased oxygen dependency , while re taining the  catalytic efficien cy for redox  
mediator s and thermostability  512. Sode et al. analyzed an oxygen -binding structural model  of 
PaGOx and predicted that eight  functional  residues were involved in  the oxidative half reaction  
513. Mutagenesis analys is by alanine substitution  of these residues and subsequent activity assay s 
indicated that  the Ser114 Ala mutant  possessed  the highest  dehydrogenase performance with a 31 % 
decrease in oxidase activity  513. Bimutation at Ser114  and Phe334  in mutated PaGOx  resulted in  
a 11-fold decrease in activity  towards oxygen in comparison with the wild-type counterpart  514. 
To simultaneous ly decrease the O2 sensitivity and maintain high activity towards glucose  with 
artificial mediators , a double mutation  was performed upon  Val564 , which  is a nonpolar site to 
guide oxygen binding, and Lys424  515, which allows enhancement of the electron transfer rate 
between Os redox polymer and PaGOx 516. The methodology to predict  the oxygen access 
pathway to screen for mutants  has been employed with other flavoprotein  oxidases . For example, 
Aerococcus viridans  lactate oxid ase bearing a A96L  mutant showed a significant decrease  in 
oxidase activity using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor , accompanied  with a slight 
increase in activity using ferricyanide as the mediator 517.  76 
 Alternatively, oxygen -insensitive dehydrogenase modified bioanodes can avoid the undesirable  
issues arising  by H2O2 84. NAD -dependent GDH  has been widely used for biosensors and EFCs 
based on the successful reduction of the overpotential  for the regeneration of NAD+. However, 
the cofactor is not tightly bound to the enzyme limiting its application for implantable devices.  
The utilization of NAD+ as a cofactor is also constrained by the compl icated electrochemical 
regeneration of NAD+ as the cofactor itself undergoes irreversible oxidation 518. GDH  using PQQ 
as the bound cofa ctor holds  promis e for use in an EFC 221,499,519 -522. DET of PQQ -GDH can be 
achieved by means of suitable  enzyme immobilization 221,520,523. FAD -dependent GDH  
(FAD -GDH) has been widely utilized in  EFCs 283,524 -533. Milton et al. found that a GOx based 
membrane -less EFC initially  had a  higher  power density than a FAD -GDH based EFC, while the 
FAD -GDH based EFC possessed better operating stability ( after 24 h continuous  operation )525. 
This confirms the negative effects of GOx bioanodes produc ing H2O2 on BOD525 and Lac530 
biocathode s. PDH266,306,534 -537 and CDH are  other  options for oxygen -inert bioanode s. CDH can 
catalyze several carbohydrates  (glucose, lactose and cellobiose ), and is promising as a versatile 
bioanode catalyst to simultaneous ly oxidize various fuels 277. PDH shows  a broad substrate 
specificity  including glucose, xylose, galactose  etc., and can catalyze  the oxidation of sugar 
anomers  at the  C-2 and C -3 carbon s of the sugar  538. 
 
Other enzymes are highly  sensitive to O 2 themselves , which is the case of most hydrogenases 
which are inactivated in the presence of O 2, limiting the large -scale development of H 2/O2 EFCs 
to replace Pt based catalyst s suffering  from scarcity and inhibition 88. [NiFe] hydrogenases are 
the most efficient hydrogenases for H 2 oxidation. Many studies have been made to produce 
O2-tolerant mutants, but none of the se mutants are  sufficiently resistant to be used as bioanodes  
88,134,228. One strategy  is to p urify oxygen tolerant  hydrogenases , such as the membrane -bound 
[NiFe] -hydrogenase s isolated from the bacteria  Ralstonia eutropha , E. coli  or Aquifex aeolicus  
65,67,338. The tolerance of these hydrogenases has been mainly ascribed to a  [4Fe-3S] cluster in 
close proximity to the  active site different from the cluster found in the sensitive hydrogenases, 
and able to provide the extra electrons required to reduce O 2 into water as soon as it attacks the 77 
 active site.  However, even when using these O 2-tolerant hydrogenases, inactivation by O 2 occurs, 
although this is a reversible and fast process. A strategy to refill electrons to deactivated 
hydro genase was proposed by Armstrong and coworkers, using an additional bioanode 539. 
Nevertheless, a membrane separator was necessary to avoid cross diffusion of O 2, and 
inactivation of the hydrogenases. Effectively, ROSs formed due to oxygen reduction at the 
carbon surface held at low potentials were found however to deactivate hydrogenase 
irreversibly335. Upper layers of 3D porous carbon matrix are believed to help to scavenge ROSs 
before they reach enzymes inside the pores 67. It found that the hydrogenase encapsulated inside a 
3D porous matrix d isplays 4 -6 times more stability  against ROS than that on a 2D electrode.  
 
To prevent the  oxygen -induced  damage  on O 2 sensitive hydrogenase s, the employment of a 
“redox hydrogel shield”  has been recently proposed by Schuhmann and Lubit z et al. ( Figure 19) 
540. A specifically designed viologen -based redox polymer  with a low potential catalyzes oxygen 
reduction at the polymer surface, thus prevent ing the inner enzyme modification layer from O2 
damage and high -potential deactivation.  Further, detailed characterization and numerical 
simulation were applied to reveal the underlying protection mechanism 379. Protection has been 
successfully achieved for [ NiFe] 540,541, [FeFe] 542 and [NiFeSe]  444,543 hydrogenases.  However, 
the effect of byproducts s uch as  superoxide and hydrogen peroxide  that are derived from  partial 
oxygen reduction should be taken into account542. Similar methodolog ies can be e xtended to 
develop a double laye red lactose biosensor compris ed of  an inner CDH and outer GOx layer 
separately544. The outer GOx l ayer can remove a high concentration of glucose  up to 140 mM , 
that is also the substrate of CDH, enabling the system to operate as a reliable lactose sensor.  78

4.5 Anti-biofouling  of implantable glucose/O 2 EFC s 
Implantable glucose/O 2 EFCs in blood suffer  from biofouling process involving  adsorption of 
layers of proteins and whole cells etc. that can impair the  rate of  diffusion of glucose and thus 
reduce the power output. Electrodes can be chemical ly modified with anti -biofouling layers that 
are hydrophilic (such as ethylene oxid e functioning groups) or zwitterionics 545,546. A range of 
coating m embranes including Nafion®, cellulose acetate, chitosan, fibronectin and 
poly(styrene -sulphonate)/poly(l -lysine) have been evaluated for their ability to reduce levels of 
biofouling, using albumin in solution 547. Fibronectin showed the best anti -biofouling effects with 
no significant differences in the voltammetric waves of [Ru(NH 3)6]3+ after exposing to albumin. 
The use of an anti -biofouling conductive poly mer, poly(sulfobetaine -3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 
79 
 (PSBEDOT)  which can be used to immobilize GOx is of interest  548. PSBEDOT bears 
zwitterionic sulfobetaine side chains, resulting in a significant anti -biofouling electrode with only  
8.4% protein adsorption in 100% human blood plasma compared to a control electrode without 
zwitterionic side chains (PEDOT). The electrochemical response to glucose in human blood 
plasma at a PSBEDOT -GOx based electrode was twice of a PEDOT -GOx electrode.  It should be 
noted that  modification s with anti -biofouling polymers  may hinder the  rate of  ET and the 
diffusion of the substrate . Alternatively, n anoporous structured electrodes with similar pore sizes 
to the macromolecules  (such as albumin) can repel pro teins 549, leaving the inner pores available 
for small molecules (such as redox mediators and fuels).  
 
Blood clot ting, occurring  when  placing foreign EFCs in the blood circulation, causes significant 
disturbance  for the glucose transport. It requires the bioelectrodes to be biocompatible causing no 
inflammatory reactions when implanted in extra -cellular fluid s between organs  39. It’s more 
challenging to make a hemocompatible surface to be implanted in the blood avoiding to destruct 
blood components 39. Cosnier ’s group utilized dialysis bags to wrap  carbon -based  electrodes  to 
prevent t he leakage  of immobilized species which were then placed in a Dacron® sleeve to 
improve  biocompatibility  31,34. However, the employment of dialysis bags requires  a large 
volume EFC. The coating of biocompatible polymer layers,  e.g. chito san 550 and collagen , etc. is 
another route 8. Miyake et al.  introduced  a 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine 
(MPC) -polymer  coating to make carbon electrode s biocompatible  341, without which  obvious 
blood clotting was observed after 2 h immersion in blood . A needle -type glucose/O 2 EFC in a 
rabbit vein displayed a power  output  of 0.42 μW at 0.56 V, while the cell without a MPC coating 
had ca. 40% lower in power 341. The decrease d performance was likely attributed to the presence 
of blood clots.  
 
Cadet et al. tested Os -complex modified  polymer m ediated glucose/O 2 EFCs in 30 anonymized 
and disease -free whole blood sample s 273. A cellulose dialysis bag was placed on the EFCs . 
Comparison of the faradaic signal from the  Os complexes  in buffer and in blood showed that 80 
 both possessed well -defined redox waves , with a 27 mV larger peak separation in blood . This 
was explained by interferences  caused by endogenous human blood constituents , a reversible  
process  as the electrochemical waves were recovered by transferring  the electrodes from blood to 
buffer. The lower catalytic response of the bioelectrodes in blood was mainly attributed to mass 
transport limit ation  as both currents increased with stirring rate. A scorbate interference 551 upon 
the biocathode was not observed 273, which may be explained by the high selectivity of the 
bioelectrode with the Os -complex modified  polymer. Over the  course of 6 h continuous 
operation in blood 273, the dialysis bag protected both enzymes, retaining twice the response of 
the unprotected system.  
 
Non-invasive EFCs (Figure 20) operating in saliva552-554, sweat48 and tear142,506 are of interest  
as activat ors for  wearable medical devices. Unlike implantable EFCs, n on-invasive  devices do 
not come into contact with blood and do not involve skin piercing , tissue damage or cause 
pain. Such biodevices are  typically  not exposed to the immune system  so that tissue 
inflammatory re sponses can be avoided . They are also called “wearable EFCs” 47, can be 
easily discarded and replaced  and generally are flexib le structures , with adequate oxygen 
supply. An interesting example is a contact lens supported microelectronic  systems  for 
glucose concentration monitoring in tears  that was  proposed in 2013 555. Xiao et al. reported a 
flexible lactate/O 2 EFC on nanoporous gold electrodes that was mounted onto commercial ly 
available  contact lenses and produc ed electricity for more than 5.5 h in  a solution of  artificial 
tears556. Other examples are tattoo48 and textile49 based EFCs producing electricity from 
human sweat based lactate. However, this approach is still not a n effective  solution for 
powering implantable medical devices.  Another emerging group of skin borne EFCs are those 
using solid -state hydrogel electrolytes with preloaded sugars, which can generate biopower 
when the human subject is not perspiring 50,557 -560.

5. Approaches for the improvement of EFC s’ cell voltage  
An additional critical  challenge of EFCs is that their output voltages are generally incompatible 
with the values  required to operate commercial ly available microelectronic  devices  (1-3 V 143,561), 
although tr ansistors requiring an operati ng voltage of 0.5 V and even lower have been developed 
562-564. The OCV of a biofuel cell is limited by the thermodynamic value s for the species used as 
fuel and oxidant . In the standard state, the relationship  between the standard Gibbs free energy 
change  ∆G0 (kJ mol-1) and Eo
 (V) can be expressed  by the equation  565: 
                                    
|∆G0| of biochemical reactants have been summarized  by Alberty et al. 566 For example, a  
glucose/O 2 EFC using GOx or  GDH as bioanode catalysts undergoes an overall reaction:  
β                      
                                                  
As |∆G0| for eq. 13 is 227.23 kJ mol-1 at 25 oC, pH 7 and 0.1 M glucose , n = 2, the value of  Eo
cell  
is 1.18 V.  
82 
  
The typical polarization curve of an EFC ( Figure 21B ) presents a wide range of information such 
as the experimental OCV and maximum cell current/current density. In practice , the registered 
OCV of a n EFC is much lower than Eo due to the presence of three types of potential loss es, 
namely kinetic (ηact), ohmic losses (I∑R) and mass transport losses  (ηdiff), in the system. The 
relationship between r egistered OCV and Eo can be determined  by11: 
                                               
where ηact is the overpotential  required to  overcom e energy barriers on the electrode -electrolyte 
interfaces ; ηact= η act,a+ η act,c, where the subscripts a and c indicate the anodic and cathodic 
reactions, respectively; ∑R is the sum  of all resistances  associat ed with current I that flows 
through  the electrodes, electrolyte and various interconnections ; ηdiff is the mass transport based 
overpotential due to reactant diffusion limitation s. Three characteristic regions, distinguished by 
the different governing overpotentials ( ηact, I∑R and ηdiff), can be found in a typical polarization 
curve ( Figure 21B )7.  
 
In region a) governed by  ηact where the reactants (fuels and oxidants) are abundant and the 
current is low, the rate of  reaction is solely controlled by the rate of heterogenous ET. The current 
I can be expressed using the Butler -Volmer equation567: 
                    
                     
               (15) 
Where i0 is the exchange current density .  
 
In the high overpotential region (>118/ n mV), the Butler -Volmer equation can be simplified to 
the Tafel equation567: 
             
               (16) 
where i is the current density; b is the Tafel slope (mV dec-1). Eq. 16 allows the determination of 
i0 and b568. Further,  the rate of electron transfer rate ( ket) can be obtained from : 
                          (17) 
 83 
 Visually, the measured OCV can be read from  the power density p rofile  or the polarization curve  
(Figure  21), which is consistent with the difference between the onset potential  for the oxidation 
of the fuel and the reduction of the oxidant, respectively7. Although the term “onset potential ” is 
quite fuzzy due to the difficulties in defin ing the exact starting points for electrochemical  
oxidation or reduction11, it can be obtained, in practice, by comparing the potential -current 
profiles of bioelectrode s in the presence and absence of the substrate  (Figure 21A )11,569. Thus , the 
measured OCV can also be express ed as80: 
                                                    
                                       
 
where Re is the resistance, E conset and E aonset are the observed onset potentials for the cathode and 
anode, Ec and E a are the thermodynamic  onset potential s at the  cathode and anode,  respectively,  
ηb and ηa are the overpotentials  for cathode and anode, respectively . Eqs. 18 and 19 suggest  the 
strategies  to maximize OCV of a single  EFC via bring the starting potential s of both bioanode 
and biocathode  closer to those of the enzyme s/cofactor s4.  
 
For biocathode s, MCOs based bioelectrodes undergoing DET with low overpotentials are widely  
adopted . Fungal Lac possesses a  much higher redox potential ( up to 0.78 V  vs. SHE 29) for the  
T1 Cu site than that of BOD ( ca. 0.67 V vs. SHE 21). BOD exhibits high er activity at 
physiological  conditions (i.e. neutral pH) and  is less sensitive to chloride ions  at neutral pH , 
making it a better candidate for implantable EFCs. Lac is usually inhibited by chloride ions and is 
active in  the pH range 4-5, making it a suitable choice for non-implantable applications . On the 
bioanode side, NAD -dependent dehydrogenase  can present a low onset potential due to the low 
formal potential of NAD+ (Eo’
NADH/NAD+ : -0.33 V vs. SHE 570). FAD -dependent dehydrogenases  
(Eo’FADH2/FAD : -0.18 V 571) are preferred  over PQQ (Eo’
PQQH2/PQQ : 0.12 V vs. SHE 572) due to the 
lower redox potential.  While O 2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenases present  a very low overpotential 
for H 2 oxidation, the O2-tolerant membrane ones oxidize H 2 at potentials around 150 mV higher. 84 
 Nevertheless, H 2/O2 EFCs based on O 2-tolerant hydrogenases and BOD possess OCV greater 
than 1.1 V 88.

5.1 Mediator optimization  
EFCs based on DET bioelectrocatalysis on both the anode and cathode  without the involvement 
of mediators are promising as they avoid any possible  toxicity effects of the mediator , in 
particular in the use  of implantable EFCs  125,573. They generally  display a higher OCV than those 
based on  MET . However, t he following  example s show that MET can generate higher OCVs. In 
an example  of a FDH modified electrode , the presence of ubiquinone as the mediator with a 
redox potential  in between those of FAD ( -0.034 V vs. SHE at pH 5.5) and heme  (0.135 V vs. 
SHE at pH 5.5) enable s transfer of electrons directly  from FAD directly rather than via the heme  
218. In other words, due to the lower energy barrier to be overcome, the external 
low-redox -potential mediators substitute the role of the “built-in mediator ” (heme) in 
communicat ing with FAD catalytic center , leading to lower overpotentials . Similar ly, when using 
an Os redox polymer with a lower potential than that of hem e 277, MtCDH  modified electrode had 
85 
 a 150 mV lower onset potential for MET than that of DET.  These examples emphasize the 
importance of engineering the redox potential of mediators for enzymes undergoing MET.  
 
ET between the enzyme and the mediator is driven by the mediator -induced overpotential ( ∆Eet), 
i.e. the difference between the redox poten tial of the enzyme catalytic active center and the 
mediator  574. According to Marcus theory, the rate constant  (ket) between an enzyme and 
mediator is given by  325 
                      
                             
 
where Z is the frequency  factor, λ is the molecular reorganization free energy , R is the gas 
constant, T is the absolute temperature.  Mathematically , the relationship between k et and ∆Eet 
display s a quadratic behaviour , with a region where  ket increases with ∆Eet (normal region) and an 
inverted region where  ket decreases with increasing ∆Eet. Typically, the inverted region is not 
observed, which  is likely due to the fact that at high ∆Eet the biocatalytic  reaction becomes 
mass -transport limited  574. ∆Eet should be as high as possible  to enhance the current density,  but 
that can result in  higher overpotentials , lowering the OCV . Improvement s in the OCV  and power 
density of a mediated  EFC are mutually exclusive 64, thus , the value of ∆Eet should be optimised 
to yield both a high  current density  and a high  OCV.  
 
In practice , an efficient  combination of redox mediator  and enzyme requires optimization 
experiments  325,575. The co -immobilization of redox mediat or and enzyme is essential for 
implantable EFCs using MET based bioelectrodes to avoid leakage . Redox polymers introduced 
by Heller et al.  271,576,577 are the most important group of med iators for the construction  of EFCs 
578. Redox polymer s also act  as the host matrix to immobilize enzymes  via electrostatic 
interaction, entrapment  and/or chemically cross -linking , resulting  in a catalytic film permeable to 
the fuels and necessary ions  271. Polymer backbones bearing organometallic groups ( e.g. Os 
complex  578, ferrocene  64,389,579,580, cobaltocene  581), organic dyes ( e.g. viologen  540,581, 
phenothiazine  507,582) and quinone  64,583,584 have been synthesized  for mediated bioelectrod es. The 86 
 utilization of redox polymers allows electrical connection of multilayered enzymes, irrespective 
of enzyme orientation, leading to high er current output. The formal potentials of redox 
polymers (Figure 22) are determined primarily by the type and the nature of the covalently 
bound redox couples ,120,271,585 and redox polymers based bioelectrodes with opti mized redox 
potentials can be fabricated by using the appropriately designed redox species.580,586 -588.  
 
Bartlett and Pratt developed a comprehensive model of the diffusion and kinetic effects within a 
uniform layer containing both immobilized GOx and mediator on an electrode surface589, which 
can be used to understand the limiting factors in redox -polymer based bioelectrodes. 
Experimental variables including enzyme loading, film thickness, substrate concentration, 
mediator concentration and electrode potential can be considered using th is approach. The 
summary case diagrams can be used to predict the electrochemical response of an electrode 
under specified experimental conditions. It thus important, although difficult, to accurately 
determine the effective enzyme and mediator concentrati ons on the electrode.

An example  is Os-complex based redox polymer s, whose formal potential can be adjusted by 
using different ligands.11,586,590,591 Schuhmann’s group has reported a series of Os -complex 
modified polymers with redox potentials, for example, close to 0 .2 V vs. SHE .587,592 
Consequ ently, glucose/O 2 EFCs with OCVs of 0.50 ~ 0.54 V were developed. In addition, 
EFCs with improved OCVs of 0.6 ~ 0.8 V could be achieved by combination of 
87 
 phenothiazine - or quinone derivative -modified redox polymer based bioanodes.64 For more 
negative redox potential s, viologen based redox polymer s can be used, for example  with a 
redox potential of -0.3 vs. SHE ( Figure  23).540 H2/O2 EFCs with high OCVs of ~1 V were 
fabricated by combination of such viologen -based polymer ME T-type H 2 bioanodes and 
DET -type O 2 biocathodes. Various ligands were synthesized to tune the redox potentials of 
the hydrogels  593. A similar viologen polymer -modified bioelectrode has been reported by 
Kano’s group for formate oxidation by FDH , and a formate/O 2 EFC with an OCV of 1.2 V 
was recorded.15 Compared to the DET -type bioelectrocatalysis and MET -type 
bioelectrocatalysis using free mediators, redox polymer -based bioelectrocatalysis possess  
advantages such as rapid rates of  ET, low levels of mediators and/or enzyme leakage. From 
this viewpoint, s election or development of redox polymers with speci fic properties, for 
example, low redox potential, high biocompatibility and stability, good permeablility for mass 
transfer of substrate and product through the film (i.e. tunable polymer film thickness) , as 
well as high affinity to enzymes, have significant potential .

Gallaway  et al. combined experimental  data with numerical model ing to examine the influence 
of ∆Eet of a series of Os redox polymer s on TvLac catalyz ed oxygen reduction  at pH 4 574. When 
∆Eet was lower than 300 mV,  a larger ∆Eet significantly enhanced the power output . The 
optimum  ∆Eet to obtain maximum power f rom an EFC using a non -limiting anode with an onset 
potential of 0 V vs. SHE  was 0.17 V . Zafar et al. studied the effects of using five different 
Os-complex modified  polymers with redox potentials over the  range -0.07 to +0. 36 V vs. SHE  
on the performance  of a mediated AmPDH bioanode 535. ∆Eet and the structur al properties 
including flexibility and length of  the tether  were crucial for  the overall  performance . The results 
indicated  that an Os -complex modified  polymer with a moderately high ∆Eet, companying with a  
long tether between the Os complex and the backbone  with a greatly enhanced ET collision 
frequency , gave higher current densities . An Os -complex modified  polymer with a redox 
potential of 0. 14 V vs. SHE, that is slightly  (ca. 20 mV)  higher than that of the bound FAD of 
AmPDH ( -0.17 V), was selected  to be optim al mediator in terms of high current density and low 
onset potential 535. On comparing  six different Os -complex modified  polymers  with redox 
potentials ranging from  -0.02 to 0.49 V vs . SHE  for Glomerella cingulata  FAD -GDH 590, two 
Os-complex modified  polymers  with redox potentials of 0.31 and 0. 42 V vs. SHE yielded  the 
highest current densities.  The above  reports imply that a moderate ∆Eet is responsible for the high 
current density , allowing for optimization of OCV further . Heller suggested a ∆Eet of 50 mV for 
implantable  glucose/O 2 EFCs using both mediated bioanodes and biocathode in order to obtained 
practical OCVs  578. Based on such a design, Heller ’s group reported a glucose /O2 EFC presenting 
an OCV of ca. 1 V and a P max of 350 µW cm-2 in an air-saturated 15 mM glucose  solution at pH 5  
578. It consisted of a GOx bioanode mediated b y an Os-complex modified  polymer with a 89 
 13-atom -long flexible tether  (ca. 0 V vs. SHE) 594, and a Lac biocathode with an Os -comp lex 
modified polymer bearing  8-atom -long tethers  (ca. 0.75 V vs. SHE ). It should be noted that O2 
can to be reduced at the low -redox -potential Os -complex modified  polymer producing H2O2 595 
and thus the interference  of O 2 on the mediator itself 540 should  also be considered.  
 
Minteer  et al. compared soluble 1,2 - and 1,4 - naphthoquinone (NQ) mediated FAD -GDH 
bioanode s and found that 1,2 -NQ derivatives had larger catalytic current densities, which can be 
explained by the high values of  ∆Eet 64. The obtained  current densities between different NQ 
species  with different structural reorganization or enzymatic affinity effects  were not comparable . 
On grafting 1,2 - and 1,4 -NQ-epoxy groups onto linear LPEI , the NQ -2-LPEI showed a lower  
mediated bioelectrocatalytic response in comparison to that of NQ -4-LPEI.  The 
NQ-4-LPEI/GDH -FDH bioanode displayed an onset potential of ca. -0.01 V vs. SHE. In 
combination  with a  non-limiting  carbon felt/BOD biocathode, the result ant EFC registered an 
OCV of ca. 0.87 V and a P max of 2.3±0.2 mW cm-2 in air -saturated 100 mM glucose at pH 6.5  64.  
5.2 Serial connection  
Unlike microbial fuel cells which often encounter voltage reversal when stacked, EFCs do not 
have this issue596. Serial assembl y of convention al fuel cells can b e employed with EFCs to 
amplify  the output voltage , while the connection in parallel can enable  increase s in current 
density  182,597. Sakai reported a carbon fibre based glucose/O 2 EFC with NAD+-dependent GDH, 
BOD and mediators co -immobilized  showing a P max of 1.45 ± 0.24 mW cm-2 at 0.3 V  and a OCV  
of 0.8 V  in the presence of 400 mM glucose52. A stacked cell of two individual EFCs allowed the 
successful operation  of a radio -controlled car (16.5 g) and a  memory -type Walkman 
continuously for more than 2 h. A microfluidic  biobattery utilizing  NAD+-dependent  ADH and 
Pt/C at the bioanode and cathode, respectively,  generated  an OCV of 0.93 V  which was increased 
to 1.44 V  on connecting two cells  in series  598. A H2/O2 EFC composed of two stacks of four 
cells in parallel  with OCV and P max of 2.09 V and 7.84 mW , respectively , was used to power an 
electronic clock and red LEDs for 8 h with no decrease in light intensity182. Miyake  et al. reported 90 
 a laminated stack of EFCS consisting of fructose oxidizing bioanode fabrics, air-breathing  
biocathode fabrics and a sandwiched hydrogel layer containing fructose  50. A triple-layer stack 
produce d an OCV  of 2.09 V, a 2.8 -fold increase  over that  of a single set cell (0.74 V)  and a Pmax 
of 0.64 mW at 1.21 V, that was able to  power  LEDs . Paper based EFCs are cost -effective as 
disposable devices  19. A screen -printed circular -type EFC system , composed of a series of 5 
individual cells with a  single cell  OCV of  0.57 V , generate d an OCV of  2.65 V  and illuminat ed 
an LED directly  599. 
 
The overall performance of  interconnected EFC in serial is limited by the weakest EFC. 
Preparation of the stack needs to be carefully controlled and reproducible, especially with regard 
to material  preparation and to the immobili zation of the enzyme s. Moreover, t he 
serial -connection of EFCs with metal lead s requires th at individual EFC be isolated properly to 
avoid short -circuits introduced by  ion-conductive electrolyte s. MacVittie  et al. prepared a 
buckypaper  supported EFC composed of a PQQ -GDH bioanode and a Lac biocathode achieving 
an OCV of 0.54 V 33. Two EFCs implant ed in a serial -configuration in  separate claws of a lobster 
showed an OCV of only ca. 0.5 –0.6 V . The potential of the serially connected EFCs was limited 
due to the ionic conductivity in the same body.  Serial connection of two lobsters bearing EFCs 
resulted in a  voltage  of ca. 1 V . A fluidic system compris ed of  five EFCs connected in series was 
able to generate an OCV of ca. 3 V sufficient to activate  a pacemaker.  Similarly, an implantable 
glucose/O 2 EFC in a clam registered an OCV of ca.  300–400 mV and  the serial connection of 3 
“electrified ” clams afforded  an OCV of ca. 800 mV 36. Due to the above -mentioned  constrain t 
caused by the ionic conductivity, serial configuration has be en primarily used for in vitro  
experimentation . As a solution, superhydrophobic surface may help to build  ionic isolation 
between signal cells 597. Three glucose/ O2 EFCs (OCV: 0.35 V) were series -connected on a 
fluidic chip and air valves were introduced between cells by a lotus leaf -like superhydrophobic 
structure . The possible output voltage was ca. 1 V.  91 
 5.3 Employment  of external boost converter  
The output voltage of an EFC can be boosted by externally connecting a charge pump as a 
DC-DC converter 600. For example, a voltage -doubler operates  by charging of two capacitors in 
parallel  separately  followed by discharge  in series. Many examples in the recent litterature 
illustrate this concept. In 2013, Southcott et al. prepared a fluidic glucose/O 2 EFC with an OCV 
of 0.47 V in a serum solution that mimic k the human blood circulatory  system 601. A single  EFC 
was connected to a combination of a charge pump  with a DC-DC converter , which increased the  
voltage from 0.3 to 2 V and from 2 to 3 V, respectively.  The result ant device  enabled the 
continuous operation of a commercial  pacemaker  601. Coupling of a glucose/O 2 biobattery with a 
charge pump and a capacitor resulted in 1.8 V electric pulses  at different intervals determined by 
the fuel concentration  381. A commercial  BQ25504 boost converter could amplify an input 
voltage in the range of 0.3 -0.5 V up to 3 V 34. The EFC/boost converter/capac itor assembly 
enabl ed a glucose/O 2 EFC implanted in rats with an OCV of 0.57 V to intermittently power a 
digital thermometer (power consumption: 50  μA at 1.5  V) and a LED (4.1  mA at 2.9  V). The 
output of o ther reported glucose/O 2 EFCs could be amplified using similar boosting system s 
(OCV from 0.6 V to 2.3 V ) to power a wireless transmitter  323, from 0.3 V to 1.8 V to power a 
LED 324 and from 0.145 V to 2.586 V for a glucometer 561. Those amplified voltage output can be 
used directly to activate microelectronic  device s. 
 
Lactate/O 2 EFCs consuming sweat and tear lactate  are of interest to activate wearable medical 
devices. A power unit composed of an EFC/voltage booster couple can be easily combined into 
wearable devices. For example, t wo lactate/O 2 biobatter ies with an OCV of 0.67 V  in parallel 
were able to generate 6 μW  at 0.376 V,  which was scale d up to 3.2 V to periodically to illuminate 
a blue LED  bubble requiring 2.5 V and 0.5 mA 49. A lactate/O 2 EFC with an OCV of 0.87 V was 
used to provide the operational voltage of an electronic watch (ca. 3  V) 506. A biobattery using 
real sweat la ctate with an OCV of 0.5 V was coupled with a  DC-DC converter /capacitor circuit 
to produce a  3.5 V pulse with a width of 53 s  54.  
 92 
 EFCs based on other fuels have also been reported. A lactose /O2 EFC with an OCV of 0.73 V 
has been integrated  with a voltage amplifier and a capacitor  289, which was coupled into wireless 
carbohydrate and oxygen biosensor platforms  with a threshold of 44 µA and 0.57 V . Three 
fructose/O 2 EFCs with an OCV of 0.7 V in series  generated 2 mW and 2 V, which was integrated 
with a minipotentiostat  contain ing a DC -DC converter  with an output voltage of 4 V  388. The 
integrated device enabled an  oxygen sensor allowing  ten measurements in the pulse mode 
without any disturbances.  A H 2/O2 EFC registering an OCV of 1.12 V can be boosted over 6 V to 
power a wireless device sending data every 25 s in a course of 7 hours continuous operation 382. 
 
It can be concluded that most reports utilized the DC -DC converter/capacitor junction with a 
pulse function. Only few reports have claimed that they can power an external device 
continuously  601. It should be noted  that part of the generated power  is consumed by the DC -DC 
converter as a price of the voltage boost, posing extra demand on EFC’s output power 561. The 
commercial  BQ25504  boost converter requires a net current input from 10 to 100  μA 34, 
requiring a high -current -density EFC. Otherwise a large r size electrode is required , hindering the 
miniaturization  of the i mplantable power source.  The need for an  external circuit increases the 
size of t he devices , making device encapsulation more complex . 
 
6. Conclusions and perspectives  
EFCs are expected to be one of the next -generation ener gy conversion system s because they 
utilize  bioavailable, renewable  and diverse  biocatalysts and  biosourced  fuels, operat e under  mild 
and safe condition s, and possess high theoretical  energy-conversion efficienc ies. In this review, 
we discuss  four main obstacles, namely low energy density, power density, stability and output 
voltage, that hinder  the success ful development of EFCs and summarize a range of potential  
solutions. In spite of  their high activity, the high specificity of enzymes typica lly restricts the 
ability of an enzyme to catalyze just a single  reaction, leading  to low fuel utilization efficiency  
and thus low power  densit ies in single -enzyme based EFCs. A rationally design ed bioanode  93 
 consisting of enzyme cascades or multi -step pathways  has been proposed to improve the overall 
energy density. Additionally , approaches  that utilise  engineer ed enzymes to increase  their 
catalytic performance, “ wiring ” enzyme with favourable orientation  to facilitate improved rates 
of direct electron transfer, utilising  nanomater ials to achieve high enzyme loading s, smart  design 
of electrode s and cell for enhance d mass transfer, as well as construct ing EFC and biocapacitor 
hybrid devices , have all been developed for high power density. A range  of approaches  ranging  
from enzyme immobilization to biochemical engineering have been investigated to extend the 
lifetime of EFCs. Mic robial surface displayed enzymes , which  are anchored on a cell surface  
mimicking the micro -environment that enzymes function in nature, are expected to provide  
enzymes with long term operational stability. Improved cell voltage s have been realized by 
well-designed  bioelectrode (MET or DET) with low overpotentials , series connection of  cells, or 
external vol tage boosters . 
 
It should be noted that these obstacles are identified  from the point of view of the measurable  
performance  of EFCs’ . Many of the  strategies  mentioned above can simultaneously address more 
than one practical issues. For example, enzyme cascades can also be used to improve the power 
density of an EFC while achieving the complete oxidation of the fuel  124. Enzyme immobilization 
also plays a key role in increasing the power density of various DET -type EFCs as it is important 
to appropriately orient DET -capable enzymes to minimise the distances of  electron transfer 
between enzymes and electrodes  21. These combined strategies can generate synergistic effects to 
enhance the performance of  EFCs and should be addressed in combination rather than 
individually .  
 
In addition to increasing  performance metrics of EFCs, expanding their functionalities  is highly 
promising to enhance the practicability.  As already mentioned, self -powered biosensors 
employing  EFCs to function  simultaneously as a power source and as a sensor offer the 
possibility to fabricate instrument -free (at least potentiostat -free) diagnostic systems 86,151,602. A 
self-powered biosensor is gener ally based on the preparation of an EFC generating power that is 94 
 proportional to the concentration of the analyte, which can be the fuel324,443,507,603,604, 
inhibitor605-607, activat or,608 biorecognition element609-611 for enzymes used in the EFC. This type 
of biosensor is promising due to features of portability, miniaturization and low -cost. Operational 
stability issue  can be overcome by  fabricating disposable devices . 
 
Rather than employing EFCs to power existing  devices that require high power and voltage, new 
concepts, i.e. self -power bioelectronics149, which utilize EFCs directly to achieve specific  
functions  can be more feasible for practical  applications . Unlike batteries requiring careful 
encapsulation to avoid the direct contact of the battery active materials and the body , EFCs 
possess the merit of  ease-of-miniaturization  as the bioelectrodes can be used directly in the body . 
A recently reported  EFC/supercapacitor system can function as a pulse generator to mimic  a 
cardiac pacemaker delivering 10 μA pulses for 0.5 ms at a frequency of 0.2 Hz  283. This is 
different from previous attempt s to use EFCs to power a commercial pacemaker  33, which 
required  a minimum voltage input of 3 V. EFC based  controll ed drug release is an emerging area 
of interest . In preliminary stud ies, an iontophoretic  system  using buit-in EFCs allowed  
transdermal release of  compounds into the skin  558 and to heal skin wound s 557. It should be 
possible to use implantable EFCs to generate electric stimuli to trigger in vivo  release of drugs  612. 
Recent  work  613-615 by Katz et al.  using bioelectrodes for insulin  release is of interest . 
 
Enzymatic electrosynthesis616 in an EFC, or self -powered bioelectrosynthesis, enables 
simultaneous electrosynthesis of valuable chemicals and energy harvest.  Rather than using  an 
external  high-power output , self -powered bioelectrosynthesis can enable  the production of 
valuable chemicals  circumventing external electricity input617. Minteer et al.  reported  the 
bioelectrocatalytic reduction of N 2 to NH 3 as the biocathode of a  H2-fuelled EFC153. This 
spontaneous process to produce ammonia is of interest to explore alternatives to the Haber -Bosch 
process.  A H 2/heptanal EFC reported recently revealed the ability to produce alkanes from 
aldehydes and alcohols152, opening the prospect of using EFCs to prepare  renewable biofuels.  
Zhu et al. developed a self -powered system by combining an EFC and an enzymatic 95 
 electrosynthesis cell and demonstrated the hig h-efficient production of 
l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine powered by glucose oxidation, suggesting that EFCs can be a 
promising power source for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and pharmaceuticals618. 
 
Although  there are significant obstacles to the development of EFCs, great opportunities to 
overcome these issues for practical applications are under investigation.  Given that  
multidisplanar efforts have been taken to this prosperous topic, t he time to transfer the lab -scale 
EFCs to real -life devices is not expected to be far away.
