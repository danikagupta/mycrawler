[1] INTRODUCTION  
Due to rapid industrialization, a lot of 
chemicals including dyes are manufactured 
and u sed in day to day life [1] . Synthetic dyes 
are extensively used in textile, dyeing, paper 
printing, colour phot ography, food, cosmetic 
and other industries. Approximately 10,000 
different dyes and pigments are used 
industrially and over 0.7 million tons of 
synthetic dyes are pro duced annually, 
worldwide [2] . Explosion of population 
coupled with industrial revolutio n results in 
pollution of water, air and soil. The discharge 
of pollutants from various industries poses 
threat to the biodiversity of the earth. The 
textile finishing generates a large amount of 
dyes containing wastewater from dyeing and 
subsequent steps that forms one of the largest 
contribut ions to water pollution [3] . The 
traditional textile finishing industry consumes 
about 100 litre of water to process about 1 Kg 
of textile material. The new closed -loop 
technologies such as the reuse of microbially 
or enzymatically treatment of dyeing 
effluents could help reducing this enorm ous 
water consumption [4] . It was already 
reported that 10 -15% of dyes are lost in the 
effluent during dyeing process [5] . Azo dyes 
have been used increasingly in industries because  of their ease and cost effectiveness in 
synthesis compared to natural dyes. 
However, most azo dyes are toxic, 
carci nogenic and mutagenic [6] . Azo bonds 
present in azo dyes are resistant to 
breakdown, with the potential for the 
persistence and accumulation  of high levels 
of dye in the environment [7] .These dyes 
cannot be easily degrade, while some are 
toxic to higher anima ls [8] . Azo dyes are very 
stable in acidic and alkaline conditions and 
are resistant to temperature and light. 
However, they can be degra ded by bacteria 
under aerobic and anaerobic c onditions [9] . 
Azo dyes are envi ronmental pollutant [10]  
and they contribute to mutagenic activity of 
ground and surface water that are polluted  by 
textile effluents [11,12] . The complex 
aromatic substituted str uctures make 
conjugated system and are responsible for 
intense colour, high water solubil ity [13] . 
Their discharge in to surface water also leads 
to aesthetic problems, obstructing light 
penetration and oxygen transfer in to water 
bodies [14,15] . Several p hysicochemical 
techniques have been proposed for treatment 
of coloured textile effluents. These include 
adsorption on different materials, oxidation 
and precipitation by Fenton’s reagent, OPTIMIZATION OF CULTURAL CONDITIONS FOR DECOLOURIZATION

 bleaching with chloride or ozone, 
photodegradation o r membrane filtr ation 
[16]. The economic and safe removal of the 
polluting dyes is still an important issue. 
Because all these physicochemical methods 
are very expansive and results in the 
production of large amount of sludge, which 
creats the secondary level of land poll ution. 
In this situation bioremediation is becoming 
important, because it is cost effective and 
environmentally friendly and produces less 
sludge [17] . Anaerobic degradation of azo 
dyes also leads to the formation of highly 
carcinogenic and mutagenic inter mediates. 
This study reports the isolation of aerobic 
bacteria from soil and identify the bacterial 
strain that were shown to be highly effective 
for decolourization of azo dyes ( Vaxent Red 
HE7B  and Vaxent Yellow HEGR ) and 
evaluate their performance under various 
conditions of temperature and pH etc.   
 
[II] MATERIALS AND METHODS   
2.1. Chemicals  
The Vaxent Red HE7B  and Vaxent Yellow 
HEGR  (Azo dyes) used in this study was 
procured from textile manufacturing industry 
in Faridabad. All the chemicals used durin g 
the research were of analytical grade.  
2.2. Medium  
Nutrient Agar media and Mineral Salt media 
(K2HPO 4-6.3, KH 2PO 4-1.8, NH 4NO 3- 1.0, 
MgSO 4.7H 2O- 0.006, Yeast extract - 5.0 gL-1). 
2.3. Isolation of Bacterial strains efficient 
in decolourization  
For the isol ation of dye degrading bacteria, 
soil samples were taken from various sites of 
textile industry like ETP (effluent treatment 
plant) and solid waste dumping site. 1.0g of 
each soil samples were suspended in sterile 
water blanks aseptically and various dilut ions 
were made accordingly. About 1.0 ml of 
higher dilutions (10-5 to 10-7) was spreaded 
on Nutrient agar plates containing dye and then incubated at temperature 37 oC up to 4 - 
5 days. Isolated colonies were picked up and 
further streaked on Nutrient agar  plates. 
Purification and initial characterization of 
isolates were done by repeated streak plate 
method and staining methods, respectively. 
Further the cultures were confirmed by 
molecular characterization.  
2.4. Screening of isolates having 
decolourizati on activity  
Screening of isolates was done in two steps. 
Primary screening was done only on visibility 
basis i.e. change in colour of media 
containing respective dye. In secondary 
screening, percent decolourization was 
measured as decrease in optical densi ty using 
spectrophotometer (Systronics PC based 
double beam spectrophotometer 2202).  
Inoculum was prepared by aerobically 
growing the cells at 37 oC for 24 h in mineral 
media at pH – 7.2. For screening of  isolates 
mineral media having concentration of dye  
100 mgL -1 was inoculated with 24 h old 
precultured cells 1.0% (v/v).  The 
decolourization of dye was monitored at 
every 24 h intervals.           
2.5. Decolourization under different 
cultural conditions  
Decolourization under different culture 
conditions was done by changing, one at a 
time, the factors with the basic conditions of 
temperature 37 oC and and pH 7.0. The effect 
of incubation temperature on the 
decolourization was studied by incubating the 
mineral media containing dye 100 mgL -1 
under a range of temperatures (15 oC, 25 oC, 
37 oC, 45 oC, 55 oC and 65 oC) at pH 7.0.  
For the study of effect pH on decolourization 
of dyes, Colonies of an overnight grown 
culture was used to inoculate the mineral 
media containing dye 100 mgL -1. The pH of 
the medium w as adjusted 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, 
8.0, 8.5, 9.0 and at temperature 37 oC. OPTIMIZATION OF CULTURAL CONDITIONS FOR DECOLOURIZATION

examined under two culture conditions, 
namely, static (no shaking), agitated 
(aerobic). In the case of aerobic tests, the 
culture flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker 
running at 200 rpm and in the static condition 
tubes were placed in the incubator directly. 
All assays were performed in triplicate with 
the uninoculated culture as the control.  
[III, IV] RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. Collection of  soil samples        
Various soil samples were taken from various 
sites of textile industry like effluent treatment 
plant and their solid waste dumping site. 12 
isolates were obtained from effluent 
treatment plant and 46 from solid waste 
dumping site. Tot al 58 different bacterial 
isolates were obtained.  
3.2. Screening of isolates  
In primarary screening, only 5 and 11 
bacterial isolates have the capability of 
showing visible decolourization of  Vaxent 
Red HE7B  and Vaxent Yellow HEGR  dye 
(100mg/l) respective ly within 5 days. Then 
these selected bacteria were used in 
secondary screening. Then the rate of 
decolourization was calcu lated by 
Decolourization assay [18] . 
 Fig. 3 and 4 showed % decolourization of 
Vaxent Red HE7B (fig.1) and Vaxent Yellow 
HEGR (fig.2 ) dyes respectively in secondary 
screening by the selected strains. Among 
selected isolates only three isolates: SPR 42, 
SPR 48 showed upto 60% decolourization with 
in three days. These 2 selected isolates were 
further used for optimization of various 
cultur al conditions.

3.3. Effect of temperature  
The selected 2 isolates showed no 
decolourization at temperatures: 15 oC, 55 oC 
and 65 oC in both of the azo dyes. In case o f 
Vaxent Red HE7B dye,  the isolate SPR 48 
showed maximum decolourization up to 60% 
within 48 h at temperature 37 oC but the 
maximum decolourization was shown by 
SPR 42 up to 61% within 24 h at 37 oC (Fig. 
5). While in case of Vaxent Yellow HEGR  
dye, the isol ate SPR 48 showed maximum 
decolourization up to 76% within 48 h at 
temperature 37 oC but the maximum 
decolourization was shown by SPR 42 upto 
80% within 24 h at 37 oC (Fig. 6). With rise 
in temperature from 25 to 40 oC the 
decolourization rate was increased but further 
increase in temperature to 50 oC drastically 
affected decolourization activity of isolates. 
The optimum temperature for the 
decolourization of both the azo dyes was 37 
oC. 
It was observed that the optimum temperature 
for the decolourization of methyl orange by 
Lactobacillus casei  TISTR 1500 was 35 oC 
[19]. Proteus mirabilis  showed maximum decolourization of azo dye, Red RBN at 
temperature30 oC [20] .

3.4. Effect of pH  
Selected isolates showed no decolourization 
at pH 5.0 and 6.0 and it was appear at pH 7 
and it goes on increasing with increase in pH 
upto 8.5. In case of Vaxent Red HE7B dye,  
the isolate SPR 48 showed maximum 
decolourization up to 70% within 48 h at pH 
- 8.5 but the maximum decolourization was 
shown by SPR 42 upto 73% within 24 h at pH 
- 8.5  (Fig. 7). While in case of  Vaxent 
Yellow HEGR  dye, the isolate SPR 48 showed 
maximum decolourization up to 90% within OPTIMIZATION OF CULTURAL CONDITIONS FOR DECOLOURIZATION  
Baljeet Singh Saharan, et al.   152 
 48 h at pH - 8.5 but the maximum 
decolourization was shown by SPR 42 upto 
92% within 24 h at pH - 8.5 (Fig. 8). It was 
already noticed that the optimum pH for the 
decolourization of methyl orange by 
Lactobacillus casei  TISTR 1500 was 6.0 
[19]. Proteus mirabilis  showed maximum 
decolourization of azo dye, Red RBN at pH – 
7.0 [20] .

3.5. Effect of Aeration  
Under static conditions SPR 42 showed 74% 
and 92% decolourization of Vaxent Red 
HE7B  and Vaxent Yellow HEGR  dye (100mg/l) respectiv ely within 24h. On the 
other hand under shaking conditions SPR 42 
showed 70% and 90% decolourization of 
Vaxent Red HE7B  and Vaxent Yellow 
HEGR  dyes respectively within 24h. It 
showed that static conditions were more 
favorable for the decolourization of azo dyes.  
3.6.Identification by 16S rRNA Sequence 
Analysis  
 The identity of the purified isolate SPR 42 was 
confirmed by16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis of 1510 base pair and it was 
designated as Bacillus subtilis  strain PK1. 
The sequence was deposited in Gene B ank 
with accession no. GQ872346.   
 
[V] CONCLUSION  
We can conclude from the above research 
that soil is the good source of degrading 
bacteria. These bacteria have well adapted in 
this effluent contaminated soil. Our isolate 
Bacillus subtilis  SPR 42 showed b est 
decolourization activity (74%) of Vaxent Red 
HE7B  and 92% of Vaxent Yellow HEGR  
dyes (100 mgL-1) at temperature 37 oC and 
pH 8.5.
