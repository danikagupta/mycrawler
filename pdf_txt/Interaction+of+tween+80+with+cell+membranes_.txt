Proteins as amphiphilic, surface-active macromolecules, demonstrate substantial interfacial activity,
which causes considerable impact on their multifarious applications. A commonly adapted measure to
prevent interfacial damage to proteins is the use of nonionic surfactants. Particularly in biotherapeutic
formulations, the use of nonionic surfactants is ubiquitous in order to prevent the impact of interfacialstress on drug product stability. The scope of this review is to convey the current understanding of inter-
actions of nonionic surfactants with proteins both at the interface and in solution, with speciﬁc focus to
their effects on biotherapeutic formulations.

1. Introduction
Throughout the past decade, there has been a steady increase in
the availability of new biological drugs for patients to treat critical
and life threatening diseases in various therapeutic areas from
oncology to metabolic diseases [1,2] . Correspondingly, there has
also been a surge in drug discovery of therapeutic proteins, espe-
cially monoclonal antibodies and their related formats such as
antibody drug conjugates and bispeciﬁc antibodies. It is critical
to preserve the stability of any biologic during bioprocessing, drug
product manufacturing, transportation, storage, and administra-
tion to the patient. Therefore, formulating the protein suitably
and optimally requires signiﬁcant attention to preserve its stability
during all possible stresses until it reaches the patient. There are
numerous mechanisms that may trigger the formation of aggre-
gates and particles (e.g. hydrophobic association of partially dena-tured protein, chemical modiﬁcations, and interactions with
interfaces) [3]. These events may affect the quality of the product
and/or increase the level of visible and sub-visible particles beyond
the acceptance criteria. The presence of aggregates also raises a
concern as a driving factor for immunogenicity; however, to date
only chemically modiﬁed aggregates of biologics have shown aclear ability to induce anti-drug antibodies in preclinical models
[4,5] .
One of the major stresses proteins may encounter is interfacial
stress (e.g. from air/water interfaces due to mixing of liquid formu-
lations, or ice/water interfaces during freezing/thawing), which if
not suitably stabilized generates aggregates or proteinaceous par-
ticles [6]. In the absence of stabilizing surfactants and while under
stress or long-term storage, fractions of the therapeutic proteins
tend to aggregate and/or generate particles [7–9] . It is in this con-
text that surfactants are prevalently used in the pharmaceutical
industry to provide and ensure protein stability, although other
excipients (e.g. cyclodextrins) have also shown protection proper-
ties[3,10,11] . Certain surfactants, such as polysorbates, have a pro-
ven safety proﬁle established by their use as excipients in small
molecule drug formulations, acting as solubility enhancers for
poorly water-soluble drugs and later used as dispersion stabilizersfor nanoparticle formulations [12–18] . The interactions of both
ionic and nonionic surfactants with proteins have been reviewed
previously [19–21] , providing a broad overview. However, the
scope of this review is focused on nonionic surfactants and their
protection of therapeutic proteins in parenteral formulations, as
they play a prominent role as protein stabilizers in commercial
formulations, in contrast with ionic surfactants [22,23] . This
review will discuss the present state of knowledge of the mode
of interaction between proteins and surfactants at air–water and
oil–water interfaces, as well as protein–surfactant interactions in
solution. Surfactants extensively used in marketed biologics (e.g.

polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, and pluronics (P188)) are the
primary emphasis for this discussion.
2. Use of nonionic surfactants in protein formulations
Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules with hydrophobic and
hydrophilic components. The hydrophobic components drive an
interaction with air-water interfaces as well as between the surfac-
tant molecules themselves in solution, driving the assembly of
micelles at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration
(CMC) [24]. The apparent CMC of a formulated protein solution
containing a surfactant may be inﬂuenced by other molecules such
as excipients or even leachates, as well as the surface active protein
drug itself, wherein the CMC of a surfactant typically tends toward
higher concentrations, presumably due to competitive interaction
with the protein in solution [25].
Nonionic surfactants are widely used in protein formulations,
especially parenteral monoclonal antibody formulations in both
liquid and dried (e.g. lyophilized) forms. Virtually all marketed par-
enteral biologics contain varying concentrations of surfactants. In
general, nonionic surfactants have been favored for use with bio-
therapeutics over ionic surfactants due to their proven safety pro-
ﬁle, primarily based on prior use in other products [6,26,27] .I n
contrast, ionic surfactants are known to potentially act as denatur-
ing agents of proteins [28]. The primary role of nonionic surfac-
tants in a protein formulation is to protect the protein against
interfacial stresses and related interactions/degradation, including
interface-induced protein aggregation [29], protein precipitation
(particle formation), and/or surface adsorption [7,29–35] . Surfac-
tants are effective against various stresses such as agitation by
shaking or stirring (air/water interfaces) [7,8,36,37] , freezing and
thawing (ice/water interfaces), and drying stresses that can occur
during lyophilization [38,39] .
The most extensively used surfactants in biologics formulations
are poly-oxy-ethylene (PEO) based surfactants, such as polysor-
bates 20 and 80 and poloxamer 188 ( Fig. 1 ). Polysorbate 20
(Tween/C21020) and Polysorbate 80 (Tween/C21080) are not only capable
of preventing protein aggregation caused by exposure to air–water
interfaces [23,40–44] and freeze–thaw stress [23,29,31,41,45–47] ,
but also inhibit adsorption to various surfaces such as sterilization
ﬁlters and primary packaging [40,48] . Various reports on polysor-
bate 20 describe the prevention of aggregation against mechanical
stress for various types of proteins, including porcine growth hor-
mone [49], recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) [9]and
recombinant human factor XIII [50]. Similarly, polysorbate 80 has
been reported to prevent aggregation induced by vortexing, rHGH
[51]; and freeze–thaw, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [29], recombi-
nant hemoglobin [41], etc. [23].
Typically, polysorbates are used in the range of 0.001–0.1% (w/v).
The choice and concentrations of the surfactant are usually deter-
mined by screening for the lowest effective concentration whichstabilizes the therapeutic protein upon interfacial stress. These
concentrations are determined by stress studies generating air–
water and/or ice–water interfaces, such as shaking, stirring or
freezing/thawing at varied surfactant concentrations followed by
aggregate and particulate analysis. The concentration chosen is
usually signiﬁcantly above the edge of failure to provide a sufﬁ-
cient safety margin and protection during real-time stress such
as transportation, stirring, and freeze–thaw. During commercial
production, the surfactant is typically added after ultraﬁltration–
diaﬁltration (UF–DF) and prior to a bulk freezing step in the
bioprocess (drug substance) manufacturing. UF–DF can alter the
concentration of polysorbate in an irreproducible manner due to
membrane adsorption. Since drug substance bulk is typically
stored frozen prior to drug product manufacturing, the presence
of surfactant is important to protect the protein from ice–waterinterfaces formed during freeze–thaw. Thus, the preferential point
of surfactant addition is post-UF–DF, but prior to freezing of the
drug substance.
While there are obvious beneﬁts from the inclusion of surfac-
tants in protein formulations, as described above, surfactants
may present liabilities that could destabilize proteins and/or hin-
der reproducible drug product manufacturing. Polysorbates are
known to degrade via oxidation and hydrolysis [52–54] and cause
oxidative damage to the protein via production of reactive oxygen
species. The oxidation of polysorbates can lead to a buildup of per-
oxides that may induce chemical modiﬁcations to the therapeutic
protein [52,53] . Recently, it has been proposed that trace amounts
of host cell protein contaminants, in the form of lipases, may fur-
ther compromise the stability of polysorbates [55]. Additionally,
it is known that polysorbates can adsorb strongly to materials con-
tacted during processing, such as ﬁlters and tubing [48].
Due to some of the abovementioned concerns, poloxamers are
being used more frequently. Poloxamers are triblock copolymers
of PEO–polypropylene oxide (PPO)–PEO, and represent another
class of nonionic surfactants used in the pharmaceutical industry.
The solution behavior of poloxamers is more complex than that
of polysorbates. These surfactants exist with a collapsed PPO block,
as unimeric micelles and higher ordered aggregates, the exact
states inﬂuenced by concentration and temperature. Poloxamer
188 (Pluronic
/C210F68) is commonly employed in fermentation cul-
tures to stabilize cells from shear stresses, reduce aggregation
and interactions with air–water interfaces, overall ensuring high
viability [56,57] . More recently, it has also been used as a surfac-
tant to stabilize protein formulations.
3. Interactions of nonionic surfactants with proteins
Proteins, being amphiphilic, high-molecular-weight molecules
tend to fold and assemble into globular structures in aqueous solu-
tions, in order to expose hydrophilic parts to the exterior and hide
the hydrophobic parts in the core of the structure. Their interaction

Khan et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 97 (2015) 60–67 61with surfactants is driven by the various forces governing their sta-
bility in solution as well as at interfaces. In the following sections,
these two aspects are discussed in detail.
3.1. Interactions of protein–surfactant mixtures in solution
Ideally, the nature of interactions between nonionic surfactants
and proteins can best be described through thermodynamic dri-
vers, such as changes in enthalpy and entropy, in relation to prop-
erties (polar, charged, or hydrophobic) of regions on the surfactant
and protein molecules themselves. Unfortunately, detailed ther-
modynamic and site-speciﬁc interaction behavior is difﬁcult to
measure and quantify, due to generally low-afﬁnity interactions
[58]. Lee et al. [6]recently performed a comprehensive review of
the interactions of proteins with polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80,and poloxamer 188 and have summarized the contributions of
the protein, the surfactant, and surfactant–protein complexes
relating to protein adsorption and aggregation behavior. Table 1
details a fairly inclusive listing of work related to interactions of
proteins with surfactants, of which several are highlighted below.
In investigating protein–surfactant interactions, considerable
work has been reported with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a
model protein, establishing interactions between BSA and polysor-
bates 20/80 or other nonionic surfactants. For instance, Perez et al.
investigated the interactions between BSA and nonionic surfac-
tants using ﬂuorescence, surface tension measurements, and com-
putational simulations [59]. Their studies demonstrate that upon
addition of protein, the surface tension behavior of the surfactants
was modiﬁed, and the apparent CMC values of polysorbate 20 and
80 increased, compared to the CMC values of the surfactants alone.
Their results also suggest that despite structural similarities
between polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80, their binding with
BSA in solution seem to be mechanistically different, with poten-
tially varied interaction sites. Distinct aggregation states of the
protein in solution seem to govern complexation with the polysor-
bates. Changes observed in tryptophan ﬂuorescence indicated the
surfactants ﬁrst preferentially associate within cavities in the ter-
tiary structure; once saturated, additional surfactant molecules
are able to interact with hydrophobic patches on the protein sur-
face. Nielsen et al. used isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to understand
the binding of BSA to nonionic surfactants with C12 acyl chains,
along with ionic surfactants [60]. In this study, it was found that
nonionic surfactants bind to proteins with association constants
several orders of magnitude lower than sodium dodecyl sulfate.
It was also concluded that large exothermic enthalpy changes
occur along with substantial increases in heat capacity during
the binding process. The enthalpy changes pertaining to nonionic
surfactants were greater than those observed for anionicsurfactants.
Hoffmann et al. [61] reported similar ﬁndings when they
assessed interactions by ITC and stability in the presence of
polysorbates 20 and 80 using differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). Here, ITC provided the binding constants and thermody-
namic parameters, while DSC yielded thermal protein stability
information. The results showed that both polysorbate 20 and
polysorbate 80 bound to BSA with a binding constant of 8–
12/C210
/C03M/C01andDH values ranging from /C050 to /C060 kJ/mol
(25/C176C). ITC was also able to determine the stoichiometric ratio:
one to two polysorbate molecules binding BSA. The large exother-
mic enthalpy changes were considered to be an outcome of the
interaction of the PEO chain (polyethylene glycol) with the protein
by hydrogen bonding. It was also recently shown that PEO chains
can also exhibit afﬁnity for proteins such as BSA [62]. Delgado-
Magnero et al. [63] support this hypothesis with their molecular
dynamics simulation results, which suggest enhanced stabilization
of BSA by cooperative self-assembly with polysorbate molecules.However, Hoffman et al. observed the interactions of polysorbates
(20 and 80) with a model mAb and lysozyme were negligible based
on ITC results, with very little binding observed at highly titrated
concentrations.
In a similar analysis performed by Garidel et al. [64], weak
interactions between polysorbates 20 and 80 were also found with
several immunoglobulins. However, this study did ﬁnd a measur-
able interaction with human serum albumin (HSA); binding only
mildly increased using a fatty acid-free form of the protein. This
ﬁnding was interpreted as the fatty acid chains of the polysorbates
being a poor steric match for the fatty acid binding pocket of HSA.
The results showed that binding constants of polysorbates to
human serum albumin were in the range of 103M/C01, a rather neg-
ligible value, leading to the conclusion that direct surfactant inter-
action is not the main factor for stabilization of the protein.McAuley et al. [65] also employed ITC to investigate the interaction
between polysorbates and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Addition-
ally, surface tension measurements and interfacial rheology were
used in order to understand the mechanism of prevention of
protein adsorption to the air–water interface by the surfactant.
No signiﬁcant interaction between polysorbate 20 and LDH could
be found using ITC. It was apparent that surface pressure effects
dominated the prevention of LDH adsorption to the air–water
interface by polysorbates. Interfacial rheology was used to suggest
the concentration of polysorbate 20 needed to displace LDH is well
below the CMC. The majority of studies based on ITC have revealed
primarily weak binding between polysorbates and therapeutic
proteins (in particular mAbs) and those with albumins suggest a
signiﬁcant interaction component driven by van der Waals interac-
tions and hydrogen bonding.
In another study, Chou et al. characterized the binding interac-
tions between the surfactants and Albutropin
TM(human growth
hormone genetically fused to human albumin) based on ﬂuores-
cence spectroscopy and ITC [66]. The authors concluded that
polysorbates and Albutropin reached saturation with a molar bind-
ing stoichiometry of approximately 10:1 (surfactant:protein) and
binding of the surfactants to Albutropin led to an increase in free
energy of unfolding. This increased free energy of unfolding was
thought to be responsible for stabilizing the protein even in con-
centrations of surfactants well below their CMC. The belief of sta-
bilizing monomeric proteins from aggregation has previously been
described in terms of molecular chaperones [40]. Earlier studies
used chemically denatured protein to evaluate protein–surfactant
interactions, protein structure, and enzymatic activity by electron
paramagnetic resonance, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and
activity assays [67,68] . These studies suggest polysorbate 20, as
well as other surfactants, may temporarily occupy hydrophobic
regions exposed on partially denatured proteins, enabling themto displace the polysorbate and refold prior to the formation of
an aggregation event.
Kim et al. [69] demonstrated based on optical waveguide light
mode spectroscopy measurements that polysorbates 20 and 80
are able to prevent protein adsorption to a hydrophilic surface
exclusively by the surfactants sterically inhibiting proteins from
associating with the interface, likely governed by preferential mass
action kinetics of the polysorbates. It was also concluded that no
signiﬁcant surfactant–protein associations occur in solution. How-
ever, poloxamer 188 was thought to have surfactant–protein asso-
ciations in solution, independent of its afﬁnity for the interface
thereby inhibiting protein adsorption to the interface. A variety
of techniques have been employed to study surfactant–protein
interactions in solutions. Ideal measurement methods based on
measuring direct interactions, are capable of providing insight into
the mechanistic drivers, and determining the site-speciﬁc locations
of molecular recognition. However, the weak interactions in play
often require more indirect methods to be used, but are still able62 T.A. Khan et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 97 (2015) 60–67to provide valuable insight and offer relative levels of interactions
between various molecules.
3.2. Interactions of protein–surfactant mixtures at interfaces
As discussed in the previous section, interactions of nonionic
surfactants with proteins vary according to the nature of the pro-
tein. It is also evident that the surfactant interaction at interfaces
typically dominates (e.g. water–air, water–container, water–
silicone oil) as the mechanism stabilizing therapeutic proteins.
The complex behavior of surfactant adsorption is governed by
many factors: bulk concentration, chemical potentials in the bulk
solution and at the interface, adsorption layer thickness, the
maximum surfaces excess, and temperature. Upon exposure of a
therapeutic protein formulation to a new interface, different spe-
cies compete to adsorb at the interface which leads to lowering
of the surface tension. A dynamic equilibrium is established due
to the adsorption and desorption process [70–72] . The ability toadsorb at the interface depends on the relative surface activity as
well as the inter- and intra-species interaction in solution [69,73] .
Early experiments evaluated the ability of polysorbate 20 to
desorb proteins previously adsorbed to hydrophilic and hydropho-
bic solid surfaces [74]. It was found that the polysorbates had little
effect at displacing proteins (ﬁbrinogen and human gamma globu-
lin) preadsorbed on the hydrophilic surfaces. However, polysorbate
20 was effective at removing the protein molecules from a
hydrophobic surface. The ability of the polysorbates to desorb pro-
tein from hydrophobic surfaces was reduced when the proteins
had been incubated for extended periods of time at elevated tem-
peratures. These conditions likely increased the surface areainvolved in hydrophobic interactions, increasing the entropic bar-
rier for solvation beyond the level the aliphatic chains of the
polysorbate could access. Joshi and McGuire [75] later demon-
strated that at the liquid–solid interface, the adsorption propensity
of nonionic surfactants depends on the hydrophobicity of the
surface. They also showed that the pre-treatment of hydrophilicTable 1

protein (lysozyme) adsorption, while precoating with polysorbate
80 on hydrophobic surfaces dramatically decreased the ability of
a protein ﬁlm to form on the surface, measured by ellipsometry.
The trends for preventing protein adsorption on hydrophobic sur-
faces held true when both the polysorbate and protein were added
in the same solution, compared to protein alone. While the mech-
anisms involved in protein surface adsorption are complex and are
determined by multiple factors (e.g. size, structural stability, and
exposed hydrophobic patch distribution [76,77] ), literature sug-
gests greater adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces (regardless of
protein properties) and by more hydrophobic proteins (regardless
of surface properties [74,78] ). Polysorbates appear to be most
effective at competing and desorbing proteins from moderately
hydrophobic surfaces [74,75] .
Biologics may also encounter silicone oil, presenting a formid-
able form of hydrophobic surfaces. Typically, silicone oil is applied
to the surface of preﬁlled syringes and represents an additional
pharmaceutically relevant interface and is required in sufﬁcient
amount to ensure long-term functionality of syringes. Previous
work has evaluated the ability of polysorbate 20 to compete with
BSA for interfacial sites on water–oil emulsion droplets [79–81] .
These studies relied on front-face ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, based
on tryptophan ﬂuorescence, demonstrating a concentration depen-
dent behavior of polysorbates to effectively displace protein from
the water–oil interface. Mass adsorption measurements using
quartz crystal microbalances (QCM) have been used in evaluating
the competition of surfactants and proteins at silicone oil surfaces
[82,83] . In one study, it was determined by QCM and surface ten-
sion measurements that polysorbate 80 was more effective than
poloxamer 188 at inhibiting the adsorption of an Fc-fusion protein
to the water–silicone oil interface [82]. This was attributed to
polysorbate 80 being more hydrophobic, lower HLB value, than
poloxamer 188. In another study, it was found that both polysor-
bates (20 and 80) and poloxamer 188 were effective at inhibiting
the adsorption of an Fc-fusion when preadsorbed, but rinsing the
surface after applying the preadsorbed surfactants enabled a
greater amount of protein to be adsorbed for the poloxamer 188
case. This effect was attributed to a weaker poloxamer 188–sili-
cone oil interaction creating more unoccupied surface after rinsing.
It was also determined that when surfactant and protein were
coadsorbed, all surfactants reduced the amount of protein able to
be adsorbed to the interface. However, it also showed that all sur-
factants were not effective at displacing a pre-existing protein
adsorbed layer.
A common method for determining the CMC of polysorbates in
solution is based upon the stabilization of the surface tension after
the concentration of the surfactant exceeds that of the CMC [84].
This is due to the previously mentioned propensity of the
polysorbate molecules to associate and orient themselves with
the air–liquid interface. This trend of concentration dependentreduction (up to the CMC) of the surface tension remains for
polysorbates in the presence of protein solutions, although often
altered by the surface activity of the protein itself [25]. A similar
study, based on dynamic surface tension, also demonstrated sur-
face tension increases of polysorbate 80 solutions in the presence
of protein (HSA); this suggests the lack of surface active molecules
present at the air–water interface was attributable to surfactant–
protein interactions in solution [85]. These solution phase interac-
tions help to block proteins from associating with the air–liquid
interface, much in the same way as the above-described competi-
tion at solid–liquid interfaces. Interestingly, the dynamic surface
tension may be reduced when interactions take place below the
CMC, as seen for solutions of GCSF with polysorbates and
poloxamer 188 [70]. This phenomenon is attributed to proteins
disrupting surfactant aggregates unable to readily adsorb to theinterface, increasing the concentration of surfactant monomer in
the subsurface layer below the interface and enhancing the rate
of adsorption. Such behavior may improve formulation stability
in shake-stress scenarios by enabling more surfactant to compete
for the interface. However, the proposed aggregate interaction
may also destabilize the protein itself by inducing a partially
denatured state.
Mackie et al. [86] propose an ‘‘orogenic mechanism” to eluci-
date the ability of nonionic surfactants to displace proteins from
the interface. They explain how small quantities of surfactant
added to a protein-adsorbed interface can break away the protein
network. This alteration of the interface is thought to be due to the
different mechanisms by which surfactants and proteins behave at
interfaces. Proteins tend to form strong interactions with one
another caused by partial denaturation, due to hydrophobic inter-
actions with large buried surface areas. In contrast, smaller surfac-tants move in the direction of surface tension gradients, described
by the Gibbs–Marangoni effect [87]. The protein network inhibits
surfactant lateral mobility and a surface pressure is induced on
the protein network, leading to competition and displacement of
proteins from the interface [86,88] . Korsmar et al. [89] and Kett
et al. [90] demonstrate evidence for polysorbate 20 driven disrup-
tion of surface shear viscosity of b-lactoglobulin. While some of the
orogenic studies may not be fully translatable to formulation stud-
ies with biologics, they provide signiﬁcant mechanistic insight
regarding the need to prevent protein adsorption at interfaces
and implications for drug product manufacturing.
4. Discussion
The various studies performed to date provide different
perspectives and possible mechanisms by which surfactants
contribute to protein stabilization. Although studies conducted
with BSA and HSA demonstrate the presence of binding propensity
of surfactant to the protein [59,60,64] it could be considered that
such binding phenomena are special situations and not broadly
Fig. 2. Basic competitive adsorption mechanism of biologics stabilization via nonionic surfactants: (left) biologic in solution without surfactant ( Cs= 0) tends to interfaces,
denatures, and aggregates; (center) biologic present in the presence of insufﬁcient amount of surfactant ( Cs= very low) is not fully stabilized and still reaches the interface in
signiﬁcant amounts, leading to measurable amounts of protein aggregation/particles, (right) biologic is present in solution with a sufﬁcient amou nt of surfactant, effectively
blocking the interface from adsorption.64 T.A. Khan et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 97 (2015) 60–67representative of actual protein formulations. The few studies on
IgG, published by Garidel et al. and others, show that the binding
energy (from ITC measurements) is weak and likely plays no signif-
icant role for stabilization [64]. The presence of surfactant is also
not expected to impact the pharmacokinetic parameters associated
with biologics, especially in the case for mAbs dominated by FcRn-
mediated recycling [91]; this is in contrast to the use of nonionic
surfactants in small molecules where the impact on pharmacoki-
netics can be dramatic [12,92] .
There are two main mechanisms by which nonionic surfactants
are proposed to stabilize proteins: interfacial competition and
surfactant–protein complexation. The interfacial competitive
mechanism where the occupancy of the interface by the nonionic
surfactant is more thermodynamically favored compared to the
protein is well documented, and governed by mass action kinetics[23,51,73,86,93–95] . This competitive adsorption of the surfactant
at the interface is correlated to an increased surface pressure by
the surfactant [96]. Conversely, surfactant–protein complexation
is primarily described by direct binding of the surfactant to the
exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the native protein, thereby
increasing the protein’s colloidal stability [9]. This would lead to
thermodynamic stabilization of the native state by hydrophobic
patches preferential binding the surfactant [97]. The described
‘‘molecular chaperone” function of surfactants stabilizes partially
denatured forms of the protein, exposing neo-hydrophobic
patches, long enough to enabling refolding of the protein [68].
To date, we believe that based on published data and from our
own experience, the primary mechanism of stabilization of pro-
teins, such as mAbs, by nonionic surfactants against aggregation
is mainly attributed to competition of (surface active) polysorbate
or poloxamer molecules against proteins at interfaces (e.g. air–
water), shown in Fig. 2 . The competitive adsorption of nonionic
surfactants at interfaces would be thermodynamically favored
[51,93,94,98] over adsorption of the protein at these interfaces.
With the decrease of the protein concentration at the interface, a
decrease in localized concentration of proteins is expected, thereby
minimizing risk of protein aggregation and/or precipitation
(protein particle formation). The connection between protein con-
centration, collision rate, and their aggregation or self-association
is known from studies of non-ideal solutions [99,100] . Surface
tension and rheology experiments [89,90] provide evidence that
the prevention of adsorption of the protein (LDH in the present
case) at the interface is more related to surface energy and surface
pressure than to the CMC. Our own studies with mAbs found that
surfactants stabilize antibodies against mechanical stress, and
found polysorbates and poloxamers have the ability to prevent
aggregation and/or particle formation against shaking at concen-
trations well below their CMC [25,101] .
5. Summary
In summary, nonionic surfactants (e.g. polysorbates 20 and 80,
and more recently poloxamer (P188)), are typically employed to
stabilize proteins in pharmaceutical parenteral products against
adsorption to surfaces and interface-induced aggregation/particle
formation. Though the mechanism of this stabilization is not
clearly established, based on present understanding, competitive
interaction of nonionic surface-active components at the interface
(such as the air–water or ice–water interface) is thought to be the
main mode of interaction between the protein and nonionic surfac-
tants for the majority of commercial products. In certain cases,
interaction and colloidal stabilization of the protein by the surfac-
tant is also found to occur. Speciﬁcally for therapeutic proteins and
mAbs, further work is warranted to evolve a clearer picture of the
interaction between biologics and nonionic surfactants.References
