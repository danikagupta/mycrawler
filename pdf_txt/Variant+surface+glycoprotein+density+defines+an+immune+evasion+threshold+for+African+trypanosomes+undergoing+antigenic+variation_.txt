ABSTRACT  14 
Long -term immune evasion by the African trypanosome is achieved through repetitive cy cles of 15 
surface protein replacement with antigenically distinct versions of the dense Variant Surface 16 
Glycoprotein (VSG) coat. Thousands of VSG genes and pseudo -genes exist in the parasite genome 17 
that, together with genetic recombination mechanisms , allow for essentially unlimited immune 18 
escape from the host ’s adaptive immune system. The diversity space of the "VSG nome" at the 19 
protein level was thought to be limited to a few related folds whose structures were determined 20 
more than 30 years ago. However, rec ent progress has shown that the VSGs possess significantly 21 
more architectural variation than had been appreciated . Here we combine experimental X-ray 22 
crystallography  with deep -learning structural prediction using Alphafold to produce models of 23 
hundreds of VSG proteins . We c lassify the VSG nome into groups based on protein architecture 24 
and oligomerization  state, contextualiz e recent bioinformatics clustering schemes , and extensively 25 
map VSG -diversity space. We demonstrate that in addition to the structural va riability and post - 26 
translational modifications observed  thus far , VSGs are also characterized by variations in 27 
oligomerization state and possess inherent flexibility and alternative conformations, lending 28 
additional variability to what is exposed to the im mune system. Finally, these  additional 29 
experimental structures and the hundreds of Alphafold predictions confirm that the molecular 30 
surfaces of the VSGs remain distinct from variant to variant, supporting the hypothesis that protein 31 
surface diversity is ce ntral to the process of antigenic variation used by this organism during 32 
infection.    33 .

INTRODUCTION  35 
African trypanosomiasis  is a human and animal infectious disease  caused by several 36 
species of protozoan parasites of the genus  Trypanosoma  [1,2] . These single -celled, euk aryotic 37 
parasites  can live and reproduce extracellularly in the bloodstream of the host,  and are transmitted 38 
by the tsetse fl y vector  (Glossina sp. ) [3]. The geographical range of the tsetse fl y in Africa 39 
correlates to the distribution of human trypanosomiasis , which today covers a region of 8 million 40 
km2 between 14 and 20 degrees latitude  [4]. African trypanosomiasis has hampered Central 41 
Africa's economic progress due to  its impact on both human and  livestock  populations  [5,6] . 42 
Within the blood, the trypanosome population is continuously  exposed to the host ’s 43 
immune system, yet is able to thrive and persist. This feat is made possible by a highly optimized 44 
system of antigenic variation, in which the ~10 million,  monoallellically  expressed molecules  of 45 
the Variant Surface Glycop rotein (VSG) coat undergo repeated cycles of “switching”, a process 46 
by which antigenically distin ct VSGs are expressed at different times  [7–9]. This creates a cyclic 47 
process of trypanosome growth to high parasitemia, immune response and clearance of the 48 
dominant VSG  variants, and the subsequent growth of immune -escape variants expressing 49 
different VSGs. This process renders the host in a perpetual state of infection that c annot be cleared 50 
without pharmacological intervention, typically leading to long -term mo rbidity and mortality  [10]. 51 
Central to this process are the thousands of VSG genes and pseudogenes in the parasite genome 52 
that serve as the parasite’s extensive  antigen repertoire. . 53 
The mature VSG proteins are attached to the c ell surface by a GPI -anchor, and consist of 54 
two main regions: (1) a large, N -terminal domain (NTD) of roughly 300 -400 amino acids that is 55 
most distal to the membrane and (2) a smaller, membrane -proximal C -terminal domain (CTD) 56 
spanning 80-120 amino acid s beneath the NTD that harbors the GPI -anchor  [11]. Multiple studies 57 .

immune system when i t is part of the coat  [12,13] , which correlates well with it being much more 59 
highly conserved in sequence than the NTD  [14,15] . The NTD is therefore p resumed to be the 60 
most antigenic portion of the VSG. Consistent with this hypothesis, the NTD typically shows 61 
approximately  10-30% identity from variant to variant  [14]. Most of the conserved residues occur 62 
in the architecturally common  regions of the VSGs, whereas the molecular surfaces (as visualized 63 
by pro tein structures) show very little similarity  [11]. 64 
Therefore, at the heart of antigenic variation in the African trypanosome are the NTDs of 65 
the VSG s. These large subdomains are elongated folds centered on a three -helix bundle scaffold. 66 
The three -helix bundle is a ubiquitous fold harbored in proteins with diverse activities, where the 67 
structural elements specific for differing  function s are often coded by sequences inserted between 68 
the helices or at the termini of the scaffold. All VSGs s tudied to date  are so structured, possess ing 69 
subdomains at spatially opposite ends of the bundle: a top lobe and bottom lobe. The recent 70 
elucidation of additional VSG structures upturned the notion that all VSGs would possess highly  71 
similar protein fold s to the initial structures determined in the 1990s. What is now evident from 72 
recent work is that the VSGs possess much more architectural and topological variation than had 73 
initially been appreciated  [16–18].  74 
Furthermore, for the thirty years after the determination of the first VSG structures, it was 75 
assumed that all VSGs were homo dimers . However, more recent structures and biochemical 76 
analys es have shown that two broad VSG classes can be distinguished by their oligomeric state: 77 
one class harboring exclusively dimers and the other class characterized by concentration - 78 
dependent trimers (existing in solution in either a stable monomeric or trimer ic state, depending 79 
on the protein concentration  [16,17,19] ). At the extreme densities of packing in the two - 80 .

trimeric state, although no high -resolution imaging of the parasite coat that could establish t his has 82 
been reported.  83 
The uniqueness of each VSG molecular surface led to the assumption that antigenic 84 
variation occurred exclusively through amino acid sequence divergence. Recent structures and 85 
mass spectrometric analys es of VSGs have shown that this i s not solely the case. Many VSGs can 86 
be modified by post -translational O-linked glycosylation at the top of the molecule and this 87 
modification has been shown to be potently immunomodulatory  [17]. Intriguingly, the same  class 88 
that adopts the trimeric oligomerization is to -date the only class in wh ich such O-linked 89 
glycosylation has been observed.  90 
Thus, in the last few years, many notions regarding the VSGs have had to be reexamined. 91 
Concurrently, the diversity space of the VSGs has been broadened dramatically, raising the 92 
question of whether the th ousands of possible VSG proteins in the genome could be organized into 93 
a coherent schema relating sequence, structure, and function. Along those lines, several groups 94 
have undertaken bioinformatic analysis of the “VSG nome”  (the set of possible VSG proteins  from 95 
the trypanosome genome) . Most prominent have been two papers that have used sequence 96 
clustering algorithms to divide the VSGs into subclasses  [20,21] . While these papers differed in 97 
aspects of method ology  and resultant classification, there was broad agreement on the 98 
classification of  VSGs that appeared to be much m ore highly related to each other. However, none 99 
of these efforts directly took protein architecture into account , likely due to the  paucity of 100 
experimentally determined structures  available at the time  of the analys es. 101 
To address this issue, we use here a collection of experimentally determined structures of 102 
VSGs ( including many solved over the last few years by our group, with several unpublished 103 .

deep -learn ing system, AlphaFold , that has proven powerful at the creation of accurate three - 105 
dimension protein models from amino acid sequence alone  [22,23] . The combined experimental 106 
and predicted data establish a structure -based classification scheme for the VSG proteins that is 107 
generally consistent with previous attempts t o classify the VSGs, but that also places classification 108 
efforts on an architectural and functional foundation.   109 .

Structural determination of VSG11  112 
 Two constructs  of VSG11 NTD were used in the structural studies in this manuscript  (all 113 
VSGs , unless otherwise noted, are  from the strain Lister 427 ). The first was the wild type sequence 114 
(VSG11 WT) that (1) crystallized  as a monomer in the asymmetric unit  in sodium -potassium t artrate 115 
with two structures determined: VSG11 WT-Iodine, a cryst al soaked in Na/K iodine diffracting to 116 
1.27Å , and VSG11 WT-Oil, a crystal diffracting to 1.23 Å reso lution  cryo-cooled in oil , and (2) 117 
crystallized as two monomers in the asymmetric unit  (not a dimer  – see Results below ) in 118 
ammonium  sulfate (diffracting to  1.75 Å , denoted VSG11 WT-AS). The second construct of VSG11  119 
was a chimeric form consisting of the VSG11 WT NTD  connected to the VSG2 CTD, denoted 120 
VSG11 N2C. This construct  crystallized with 18 monomers of VSG11 N2C in an asymmetric unit 121 
comprised of six trime ric assemblies  (denoted VSG11 N2C-18mer ). VSG11 WT-18mer  crystals  were 122 
also obtained that diffracted to nearly 3Å resolution, but the best diffracting crystals were produced 123 
by the VSG11 N2C construct (2.6 Å resolution) . Therefore, the presence of the VSG2 CT D was not 124 
required for the formation of the 18mer form, and since in both cases the CTDs were not present 125 
in the crystallized form, it is unlikely that the 18mer form is tied in any manner to the chimeric 126 
form.  127 
Plasmids used to generate VSG11 WT and VSG11 N2C were described in  [17]. Plasmids were 128 
first linearized by EcoRV (New England Biolabs), and then transfected into VSG2 -expressing 129 
cells (2T1) : 10ug of each plasmid were mixed with 1 00ul of cells ( at a concentration of between 130 
2.5x107 and 3x107) in Tb -BSF buffer (90mM Na 2HPO 4, pH 7.3, 5mM KCl, 0.15mM CaCl 2, 50mM 131 
HEPES, pH7.3), using an AMAXA nucleofector (Lonza) program X -001, as previously described 132 .

Blasticidin at a concentration of 100ug/ml was added after 6h and single -cell clones were 133 
obtained by serial dilutions in 24 -well plates and collected after 5 days.  134 
Clones initially screened with flow cytometry for VSG2 loss of expression using a 135 
monoclonal VSG2 WT antib ody [25] and VSG11 gain of expression with anti -VSG11  antisera. To 136 
determine the binding of antisera to live trypanosomes, 1 x 106 parasites were coll ected and 137 
incubated with VSG2 WT antisera (1:4000) or VSG11 WT (1:1000) together with Fc block (1:200, 138 
BD Pharmingen) in cold HMI -9 without FBS for 10 min at 4oC. Cells were washed once with cold 139 
HMI -9 and resuspended in 200 µl cold HMI -9 with rat anti -mouse IgM-FITC (1:500, Biolegend). 140 
After one wash with cold HMI -9, cells were resuspended in 150µ l HMI -9 and immediately 141 
analyzed with FACSCalibur (BD Bioscences) and FlowJo software (v10).  For a second step, 142 
clones were sequenced by isolating RNA using the RNea sy Mini Kit (Qiagen), followed by DNAse 143 
treatment with the TURBO DNA -free kit (Invitrogen) and cDNA synthesis with ProtoScript II 144 
First Strand cDNA Synthesis (New England Biolabs). The sequences were then amplified, using 145 
Phusion High -Fidelity DNA Polymera se (New England Biolabs), a forward primer binding to the 146 
spliced leader sequence and a reverse binding to the VSG 3´untranslated region. The final products 147 
were purified by gel extraction from a 1% gel with the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean -up kit 148 
(Machere y-Nagel) and sent for Sanger sequencing.   149 
All VSG11 constructs were expressed in T. b. brucei  cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in HMI - 150 
9 media (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), L -cysteine and ß - 151 
mercaptoethanol. The cells from 3.6 lit er culture were pelleted and the VSG11 protein s purified  152 
through modifications of previously published protocols  [26]. The cells were lysed with 40 ml 0.4 153 
mM ZnCl 2, after centrifugation (10.000 g, 10 min) the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml 20 mM 154

protein was further purified on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) 158 
equilibrated in 10 mM H EPES /NaOH pH=8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the VSG 159 
protein were pooled and concentrated.  160 
VSG1 1WT crystals  containing only the N-terminal domain appeared after several days at 161 
22°C using hanging drop method with 6 mg/ml VSG11  (full-length)  protein i n a 1:1 volume ratio  162 
against 100 mM Tris/HCl pH=7.5 1.6 -1.75M sodium -potassium t artrate. CryoOil (MiTeGen) was 163 
used as cryoprotectant and the VSG11 WT-Oil crystals flash -cooled  in liquid nitrogen . The loss of 164 
the CTD is presumed to have occurred during the crystallization stage. VSG11 WT-Iodine  crystals 165 
soaked in 200 mM KI, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and 1.7 M NaKTartrate were flash -cooled  directly 166 
in liquid nitrogen .  167 
VSG11 WT-AS crystals were grown at 22 °C by vapor diffusion using hanging drops with a 168 
1:1 volume  ratio of 6mg/ml protein to an equilibration buffer consisting of 0.1M sodium acetate 169 
pH 4.5 and 2M ammonium sulfate. For cryoprotection the crystals were transferred to the same 170 
buffer as that used for equilibration but supplemented with 25% v/v glycerol and were flash -cooled  171 
in liquid nitrogen.  172 
For VSG11 N2C-18mer  the crystals were grown at 22°C by vapor diffusion using hanging 173

Villingen. Iodine soaked crystals was collected at 1.54 Å on a Rigaku X -ray generator and detector . 179 
The structure was solved from VSG11 WT-Iodine  by single wavelength anomalous diffraction  180 
(SAD ) using SHELX  [27] and HKL3000 suite  [28]. The initial model was buil t using Arp/wARP 181 
[29] with PHENIX  [30], COOT  [31] and PDB _REDO  [32] for model optimization  and refinement.  182 
The structure s of VSG11 WT-Oil, VSG11 WT-AS, and VSG11 N2C-18mer  were solved by molecular 183 
replacement using the refined VSG11 WT-Iodine  model with the PHASER package [33] of 184 
PHENIX , and the model s optimized and refined with PHENIX -REFINE [30] and with cycles of 185

Struc tural determination of VSG615  189 
T.b. brucei  expressing VSG615  [34] were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in HMI -9 media 190 
(PAN Biotech) supplemented  with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), L -cysteine and ß - 191 
mercaptoethanol. The cells from 4L culture were pelleted and the VSG615 protein purified through 192 
modifications of previously published protocols [26]. The cells were lysed with 40 ml 0.2 mM 193 
ZnCl 2, after centrifugation (10.000 g, 10 min) the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml 20 mM 194 
HEPES/NaOH pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl (42°C) and cen trifuged (10.000 g, 10 min). The supernatant 195

mM HEPES/NaOH pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl. The flow -through was collected and concentrated to 197 
final concentration 1 mg/ml.  198 
To generate N -terminal domain (NTD) of VSG615, the concentrated protein was subjected to 199 
limited proteolytic digestion using trypsin. The VSG at the concentration of 1 mg/ml was mixed 200 .

further purified  (separating the NTD from the CTD)  by size exclusion chromatography on a 203 
HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) e quilibrated in 20 mM HEPES/NaOH 204 
pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl.  The fractions containing the NTD of VSG615 from size exclusion 205 
chromatography were concentrated to final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 500 µl of final volume. 206 
The lysine residues on the protein were subse quently methylated by reductive alkylation  [35]. 10 207

solution and mixed gently. The mixture was incubated for 2 hours in the dark at 4 °C with rotation  209 
and the entire process repeated. Prior to overnight in cubation, 5 µl of 1M DMAB was added. To 210 
stop the reaction, 1M Tris pH 7.5  was added to bring the reaction to a final volume of 1 ml . The 211

VSG558 was amplified from genomic DNA of T. brucei brucei  strain L ister 427 VSG2 225 
expressing cells. The plasmid used to generate VSG558 -expressing trypanosomes was a 226 
modification of previous plasmids design ed for int egration into the trypanosome genome [25]. The 227 
plasmid was first linearized by EcoRV (New England Biolabs), and then transfected into VSG2 - 228

nucleofector (Lonza) program X -001, as previously described [24]. After 6h hygromycin was 231 
added to a concentration of 25 ug/ml and single -cell clones were obtained by serial dilutions in 24 - 232 
well plates and collected after 5 days.  233 
Clones were initially screened with flow cytometry for VSG2 loss of expression using a 234

conjugation kit, Abcam ab102884) (1:200) in cold HMI -9 without FBS for 10 min on ice. Cells 237 
were washed twice with cold HMI -9, resuspended in 200µ l cold HMI -9 and immediately analyzed 238 
with a Guava EasyCyte 4HT Flow Cytometer (Luminex). For a second step, negative clones were 239 
sequenced by isolating RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit with on -column DNAse digestion 240 
(Qiagen) and cDNA synthesis with Superscript IV first strand synthesis system (Thermo Fisher). 241

Protein Structural Prediction with AlphaFold (ColabFold ) 257 
VSG  sequences  that generated AlphaFold prediction s (generated using ColabFold [36]) 258 
were obtained from Rock efeller Uni versity  (https://tryps.rockefeller.edu/ ). Structure prediction 259 
was performed  for only the N-terminal domain sequence s (spanning approximately  350 amino - 260 
acids , depending on the VSG ). The structure prediction process consisted of five steps: MSA 261 
construction, template search, inference with five models, model ranking based on mean pLDDT 262 
and const rained relaxation of the predicted structures. The LocalColabFold command line 263 
interface was used with arguments to specify an input FASTA file, an output directory, and various 264 
options to for structure predictions. MSA was generated by MMseq, which  search es sequences 265 
with three iterations against the consensus sequences of the UniRef30  [37], a clustere d version of 266 
the UniRef100  [38]. The number of final MSA hits was limited using the HHblits (v3.3.0) diversity 267

Additional Experimental Structures to Map VSG Diversity  278 
Three novel VSG structures published  between  2018  and 202 1 — VSG3, VSG13, and 279 
VSGsur  [17,18]  — have demonstrated that t here is far more diversity in the VSG  coat proteins in 280 
fold, oligomerization, topology, and post -translational modification than was appreciated. To 281 
further map the diversity space  of the VSG nome, we have undertaken X -ray crystallographic 282 
studies of numero us VSGs. Guided by recent bioinformatic analysis  [20,21] , we sought to examine 283 
VSGs from different clustering cl asses. In a separate paper  [16], we determined structures of three 284 
metacyclic VSGs : VSG397, VSG531, and VSG1954 , representing three clustering classes . In this 285 
paper w e present experimental structures of VSG11 , VSG615 , and VSG558 . 286 
VSG11 and VSG615 are related to VSG3 (the topologically -similar  class of monomer/ trimers 287 
with O-linked glycan PMTs ), denoted as class B  [40] or N4 [21] in the literature . These were 288 
examined to confirm the fold and oligomerization of this class as well as the presence of O-linked 289 
glycosylation. Previously determined s tructures of VSG3  [17] and VSG1954 [16] showed that 290 
both possess highly similar trimers in the crystals. Furth er confirmation of the trimeric 291 
oligomerization state of members of this class came from a biochemical analysis of several VSGs 292 
that showed evidence of concentration dependent monomeric and trimeric forms of VSG9 in 293 
solution  [19]. However, unlike VSG3, the structure of VSG1954 showed no evidence of O-linked 294 
glycans , despite possessing a conserved glycosylation sequence [16,17] . Whether this  absence is 295 
due to unknown regulator y processes yet to be identified,  to the sugar being labile and removed 296 
during purification/crystallization as occurred for VSG3  [41], or to a difference between 297 
meta cyclic and bloodstream VSGs, is unclear. Therefore, pursuing additional studies of related 298 
VSGs could aid in determining how many VSGs are so modified.  299 .

respectively  (Methods, Figu re 1A and 1B , Supplementary Figure 1 , Table S1 ). Both  reveal a fold 301 
similar to VSG3 (Figure 1C) as well as the presence of O-linked glycans on the top surface of the 302 
protein  – one observed on VSG11 and two on VSG615 , although with heterogeneity  on the latt er 303 
(Figure 1, A and B ). Like VSG3, VSG11 and VSG615 presen t as monomer s in solution ( assessed 304 
by size-exclusion chromatography, Supplementary Figure 1) . This crystal form of VSG11  305 
(VSG11 WT-Oil, see Methods and Supplementary Table 1 ) crystallize s as a monom er in the 306 
asymmetric unit of the crystal , but forms  a trimer along a crystallographic three -fold axis of 307 
symmetry that is nearly identical to th e crystallographic trimer s seen  with VSG3 and VSG1954  308 
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, VSG615 crystallized with two t rimers in the asymmetric unit, and these 309 
trimers align well with those of VSG3, VSG11, and VSG1954 (Figure 2A), providing additional 310 
support that class B trimer formation is not a crystallization artifact, but could represent the 311 
relevant, biological assem bly. 312 
An additional  crystal form of VSG11 show s non-crystallographic trimerization in the 313 
asymmetric unit , while another form also raise s the possibility of an inherent flexibility that could 314 
be present in the VSG proteins. In a second  crystal form  (VSG11 N2C-18mer , determined  to 2.6 Å 315 
resolution , Methods and Table S1 ), the asymmetric unit contains six trimers of the same 316 
arrangement as observed previously  for all class B VSGs , for a total of 18 independent molecules 317 
(hence “18mer”, Figure 2B). In addition to  helping establish that this specific trimeric arrangement 318 
is the preferred oligomerization of this class  (at least at higher concentrations) , the independent 319 
monomers in this asymmetric unit display a range of alternative conformations, particularly in th e 320 
bottom lobe of the protein and even in some limited regions of the three -helix bundle (Figure 3A). 321 
An overall structural alignment of the monomers  to themselves  gives an  average  RMSD of 1.33 Å 322 .

Examination of the set of 323 
alignments f rom the monomers of the 18mer show that it appears that the divergence primarily  324 
occurs in the lower lobe (Fig ure 3A).  325 
The third  crystal form (VSG11 WT-AS grown in ammonium sulfate  and solved to 1.75Å 326 
resolution , Methods , Supplementary Table S1 ) contain s two molecules in the asymmetric unit  327 
(Supplementary Figure 2A) . However, t hese two monomers are not arranged in a standard class A 328 
type dimeric arrangement in which  the three -helix bundles, top , and bottom lobes a lign alongside  329 
each other, but are instead “tail-to-tail” with the lower lobe of one monomer interacting with the 330 
lower  lobe of the other  (Supplementary Figure 2 A). In contrast , the crystal packing  is characterized 331 
by a three -fold trimer identical to those  seen in the all the class B protein  structures solved to date , 332 
including the alternati ve crystal forms of VSG11  (Supplementary Figure 2 B). Therefore, the 333 
assembly of VSG11 WT-AS is most accurately described as trimer ic and not dimer ic (and certainly 334 
not di mers in the sense of those seen in class A  VSGs ), providing an interesting example in which 335 
the contents of the asymmetric unit of the crystal do not present the likely biological assembly, 336 
whereas the crystallographic arrangement does . Intriguingly, the se two independent monomers are 337 
characterized by a significant conformation al change in bottom lobe of the protein . This change 338 
consists of a 1 2-degree rotation of the bottom lobe from one monomer to the other  (Figure 3B).  339 
In addition, alignments of the VSG 11WT-Iodine crystal form with the VSG11 WT-Oil form  340 
(Methods and Supplementary Table S1)  show that the second  helix of the three -helix bundle 341 
displays a significant  conformation al change in the region near the middle of the bundle , the helix 342 
becoming disord ered and forming a random coil in one monomer while keeping helical structure 343 
in the other (Supplementary Figure 2 C). Finally, w hen the different monomers of the 18mer are 344 
compared with the other crystal forms  described , a wide variety of conformation al changes is seen, 345 .

(Supplementary Figure 3) . 347 
These alternative conformations, seen in several crystal form s where the protein is not highly 348 
constrained by the energetics of c rystal packing (non -crystallographic symmetry), suggests that 349 
the VSGs on the membrane could potentially be characterized by a collection of conformers, each 350 
with molecular surfaces that differ in these regions. It is possible that such differing conformer s 351 
could present distinct antigenic surfaces and impact the immunogenicity of the VSG s, combining 352 
with other forms of variability such as  surface protein features and post -translational modifications 353 
to augment the diversity space of the coat . 354 
Finally,  the structure  of the VSG558  NTD  was determined  to 1.96 Å resolution  (Figure  1, D- 355 
F, Methods,  Supplementary  Figure  1, and Table  S1). It has a highly  similar  structure  to VSG13  356 
[18] with a 2.54 Å RMSD  over 324 residues  (Figure  1F). This includes  a broad  and flat beta-sheet  357 
top-lobe that forms  an intermolecular  beta-sandwich  in the dimeric  assembly,  a distribution  of 358 
disulfides  throughout  the length  of the rod-like structure,  an N-terminus  located  in the “middle  359 
lobe”  of the protein  (instea d of at the top, most  membrane  distal  face of the VSG ), and the presence  360 
of N-linked  glycans  directly below  the top lobe.  A notable  difference  with all the previously  solved  361 
VSG  NTD  structures  published  is the presence  of two N-linked  glycans  at the middle  lobe of the 362 
VSG558  protein.  To date,  all VSG  structures  determined  have  been characterized  by a single  N- 363 
linked  glycan  (or none , as seen in the case of ILTat1.24).  However,  it has been  established  364 
biochemically  that some  VSGs  do possess  more  than one such sugar  in the NTD,  such as VSG5  365 
[42]. The structure  of VSG558  confirms  the presence  of multiple  N-linked  glycans  for another  366 
VSG . This shows  that not only are the locations  of the N-linked  glycans  variable  (found  in both 367 
the bottom  and middle  lobes),  but that the number  of possible  such carbohydrates  is also variable.  368 .

Overall classification of the VSGs based on structures.  370 
Altogether, as of the wri ting of this manuscript, there are  twelve  experimentally determined 371 
protein structures of the VSG NTD from Trypanosoma brucei  in hand: VSG1, VSG2, VSG3, 372 
VSG11, VSG13, mVSG397, mVSG531, VSG558, VSG615, mVSG1954, VSGsur, and IlTat1.24  373 
(“m” before the name in dicat ing a metacyclic -stage expressed VSG) . These twelve  structures not 374 
only map well to the previous bioinformatic clustering schemes published previously, but they 375 
better discriminate between them and put the classification schemes on an architectural fo undation. 376 
We have sought to take these structures, with an eye to the bioinformatics work, and create what 377 
we conclude is a more explanatory organizational scheme for the VSG proteins  (Figure 4). To 378 
provide continuity with the previous classification schem es of Hutchinson [15] and Cross  [40], we 379 
have preserved the A/B desi gnation for classes . However, this has required a change in the 380 
meaning of subdivisions within class A  to reflect insight from the protein stru ctures (discussed 381 
below ). Finally, this schema was then tested  by modeling hundreds of VSG proteins with the deep 382 
learning system AlphaFold and comparing the resultant folds to the classes we created.  383 
To begin, there are two broad “super -families” of VSG structures based on the topological 384 
arrangement of the bottom lobe in the primary sequence  (classes A and B, Figure 4, Supplementary 385 
Figure 4). All VSG  NTD structures determined have a bottom lobe subdomain structure . In class 386 
A the bottom lobe residues are present at the C -termi nal portion of the NTD sequence , directly  387 
following the final helix  of the bundle. In contrast, in  class B the bottom lobe r esidues are present 388 
at the N -terminal portion of the NTD sequence  between the amino acids that form the first and 389 
second helices of the bundle  (Supplementary Figure 4). Further cementing this broad division into 390 
two main super -families are two observations . The first is that all class A VSGs studied to -date 391 .

dimers in the asymmetric unit or as monomers in the asymmetric unit where a crystallographic 393 
two-fold symmetry produces the dimer, [18,41,43] ), whereas all studied class B VSGs are 394 
characterized by the same trimeric arrangement in the crystals (either through crystallographic or 395 
non-crystallographic symmetry , with monomers or trimers in the asymmetric unit, respective ly), 396 
with biochemical evidence of monomer to trimer transitions based on protein concentration  [19]. 397 
The second fact is that many of the class B VSGs are post -translationally modified by O-linked 398 
carbohydrates , whereas none of the class A VSGs have been found so modified. When comparing 399 
with previous efforts to classify the VSGs, our class A would correspond to class “A” in Cross  400 
[40], classes N1 -N3/N5 in Weirather [21], and the older class A of  Carrington  [44]. Class B would 401 
correspond in these sources to classes B, N4, and B, respectively.  402 
Within our class A superfamily are two large structural subclasses, A1 and A2 (Figure 4). In 403 
class A2 are found all the VSG structures that were solved prior to 2018 (Iltat1.24, VSG1, and 404 
VSG2), illustrating that the set of conclusions about VSG structure and function accepted for over 405 
a quarter century  were based on a  very limited subset of VSGs containing  highly related  protein 406 
folds. This s ubclass is characterized by a top lobe that contains all the cysteine disulfides in the 407 
NTD, a top lobe fold that is a hodge -podge of alpha helices and beta -strands, and N -linked glycan 408 
chains located in the bottom lobe of the NTD . In sharp contrast, subcl ass A1 VSGs are significantly 409 
longer due to the presence of a large beta-sheet subdomain for the top lobe ( forming a beta - 410 
sandwich  in the dimer ). Further distinguishing A1 from A2 is the distributed nature of the disulfide 411 
bonds (present throughout the length of the VSG in A1), the presence of a “middle lobe” of 412 
secondary structure straddling the beginning of the three -helix bundle,  and the location of the N - 413 
linked sugar just below the beta -sandwich top lobe. This dramatically different arrangement in 414 .

toward the middle of the VSG fold in A1 but located at the very top of the fold in A2. Additionally , 416 
the fold s of the A1 VSGs from experimental and predicted struct ures (see below)  suggest that this 417 
subclass should  be further subdivided into three groups based on the size, conformation, and twist 418 
of the top lobe beta -sheet and the width of the space between the three -helix bundles in the dimer.  419 
These subclasses of A1  were in previous sequence clustering classification systems denoted as the 420 
separate classes A1 and A3 [40] and N1, N3, and N5  [21]. However, all these subclasses are 421 
structurally similar to  each other in the manners described above while differing markedly from 422 
the A2/N2 classes. Therefore, we considered it better to combine A1/A3 and N1/N3/N5 into a 423 
single class, A1 (a family contrasted to A2), and the n subdivide them within A1 : A1a, A1b, A 1c 424 
(Figure 3).  425 
Finally, Cross  et al.  [40] divide the class B VSGs into two subgroups , whereas Weirather et 426 
al. [21] do not subdivide their equivalent class , N4. In contrast to the marked st ructural divergences 427 
between classes A1 and A2, and even the differences within the  distinct  subclasses of A1, w e find 428 
no broad  structural differences  within the  class B VSGs (examining features such as the protein 429 
fold, disulfides, N - or O-linked glycans,  or oligomerization ). However, three  more  subtle 430 
differences between members of the B class can be used to  divide them into two subgroups. For 431 
example , two helical regions differ between the B1 and B2 subgroups. One helix that exists in the 432 
top lobe of the  B2 class is not generally present in the B1 class  (Supplementary Figure 5A) . 433 
Secondly, one of the bundle helices in class B1 is disordered in places relative to the same helix  in 434 
many class B2  members  (Supplementary Figure 5B). Thirdly,  in class B2 severa l VSGs possess 435 
an NTD  with more amino acids . In the AlphaFold predictions  discussed below , these additional 436 
residues are predicted to form both an extended  loop in the disordered region of the helix  and also  437 .

Buttressing this  subdivision of class B, 438 
when multiple B1 and B2 VSGs (from experimental and AlphaFold predicted models) are 439 
analyzed by structure ( using the Dali Server [45]), these are divided into two classes consistent 440 
with the B1 and B2 groupings produced by sequence analysis  (see the structural dendogram in 441 
Supplementary Figure 5C). We have therefore denoted a split in Figure 4 between the B1 and B2 442 
classes.  443 
 444 
Mapping the VSG nome with AlphaFold  445 
The AlphaFold deep learning artificial intelligence  system is software developed by  446 
Alphabet/Google's DeepMind program  [22,23,36] . In 2020, AlphaFold established itself as a 447 
breakthrough technology with robust accuracy in the prediction of p rotein structure from amino 448 
acid sequence , leading many to suggest that the “protein folding  problem ” had been solved.  We 449 
sought to utilize AlphaFold to quickly examine the sequences of hundreds of VSG proteins and 450 
compare the structur al predictions both to experimentally determined VSGs as well as assess the 451 
fit of our classification scheme to the VSG nome as a whole.  452 
We began by assessing the accuracy of AlphaFold against known VSG structures that exist ed 453 
in the PDB database  at the time of writing this man uscript , and which  would therefore be accessible 454 
to AlphaFold as structural templates. In addition, as the VSGs are multimers  (dimers and trimers)  455 
and AlphaFold can predict both isolated folds and folds as oligomers  [36], we generated models 456 
for monomer VSG sequences as well as for the appropriate oligomer for a given VSG sequence. 457 
Using ColabFold  (Methods)  and an in put sequence of these  VSGs in the database, we examined 458 
five ranked models output by the software from which the rank 1 model (highest pLLDT score, 459 
see Methods) was compared with experimentally solved structures. For both monomer and 460 .

templates: VSG1, VSG2, and IlTat 1.24, after which the models were obtained using default 462 
settings. All VSG structures predicted by AlphaFold were of high accuracy  (Figure 5A) , with 463 
multimer predictions showing lower RMSD values compared to monomer predictions .  464 
Next, we repeated this analysis  against structure s not yet available  in the protein database  at 465 
the time of the analysis, namely VSG397, VSG531, and VSG1954 [16] and VSG11 and VSG615 466 
from this manuscript. These recently determined structures  were well -predicted by AlphaFold , 467 
although with slightly higher RMSD values  as compared to the predictions for VSG structures  468 
already in the database  (Figure 5B). Typ ically in these models, t he three -helix bundle region 469 
showed the most accurate alignment,  while discrepancies appeared mostly in loop regions 470 
connecting secondary structure. The predicted location of disulfide bonds matches very closely 471 
those observed in the experi mental structure s (Supplementary Figure 6). Finally, a s noted in the 472 
Methods, the structures of VSG558 and VSG615 were solved  by molecular replacement using th e 473 
AlphaFold model  of the se VSGs  as search model s, indicating a very close fit of the model to the 474 
experimental data. These robust results from AlphaFold provide confidence that it can be used as 475 
a tool to rapidly and robustly map the structural diversity of the VSG nome.  476 
Focusing on  the Lister427 strain database  (Methods) , we examined 215 NTD sequences with 477 
AlphaFold and compared these predictions to the existing structures known . Our results can be 478 
summarized by stating that all of the predicted structures conform to our classification scheme and 479 
no structure was predicted that conflicted with our schema  (Figure 6). We also  examined 83 480 
sequences from a second Trypanosoma brucei  strain, T. brucei brucei  927. All VSGs examined 481 
from Tb 927 were predicted to adopt structures fitting our classification scheme  (Supplementary 482

experimental structures  (which currently do not exist)  may be required on which the AlphaFold 485 
system can train to produce more reliable models.  486 
From this it can be concluded  that the space of protein structure for the T. brucei  VSGs  can 487 
be well -described by the classes we have presented in this manuscript.  As an overarching 488 
observation, both the experimental structures and the predicted AlphaFold models all display 489 
unique mol ecular surfaces in terms of the distribution of chemical properties exposed to the 490 
immune system (charge, hydrophobicity, topography, etc., Supplementary Figure 9). This is of 491 
course consistent with the notion that the VSGs are each antigenically distinct,  presenting unique 492 
faces to the immune system.  493

A mechanistic u nderstanding of antigenic variation in the African trypanosome will require a 497 
complicated mix ture of knowledge regarding the epitope space exposed to the host immune system 498 
and how t he repertoires of antigen recognition in immune cells respond to this chemical space in 499 
the dynamic process of coat switching and the adaptive immune response  [41]. At the most basic 500 
level, such an understanding necessitates a th orough knowledge of VSG antigenic diversity. 501 
Therefore, understanding the possibilities and constraints of VSG protein architecture is a critical 502 
step in this direction.  503 
We have presented in this manuscript and in  recently published work a collection of ne w 504 
experimental VSG structures. Combined with those already known, we have developed a 505 
structure -based classification scheme for the T. brucei VSGs that shows the breadth of possible 506 
protein folds for the major coat protein of the African trypanosome as wel l as constraining the 507 
underlying conformational possibilities inherent in the VSG nome. This classification scheme is 508 
enriched by including hundreds of VSG structur al models  by predicting folds using the deep 509 
learning system , AlphaFold. This revolutionary process  was first validate d on the VSG proteins 510 
by predicting  the folds of experimentally determined VSGs in the database as well as several  novel 511 
VSG structure s we have determined that ha d not be en published (and thus could not serve as 512 
templates for Alpha Fold). AlphaFold predicted all with high accuracy , always performing better 513 
(as determined by match to the experimental structures) when asked to predict an oligomer of the 514 
right number for a given VSG (dimer or trimer ). Since protein folding can be partia lly dependent 515 
on higher -order protein -protein associations, this suggest s that the deep learning training of the 516 
AlphaFold algorithms has captured some aspect of the energetics of this dependency. Once we 517 
were confident in the predictions of AlphaFold for the VSG proteins, we analyzed hundreds of 518 .

proposed classification system.  520 
This provides  an architectural framework to understand the VSGs, integrating the  key 521 
structural and biochemical  features of each class (protein fold and topology, oligomerization, 522 
positions of disulfides and N -linked glycans, presence of surface O-linked glycosylation). The 523 
importance of these constraints and the broadening of previous kno wledge can be seen in the 524 
incorrect assumptions that were derived from the first three VSG structures determined over the 525 
period of 1990 -2017 (VSG1, VSG2, and IlTat1.24). By happenchance, these three VSGs are not a 526 
random sampling of the VSG nome, but are c lustered by structure into a single VSG class ( A2) 527 
with specific oligomeric and structural properties that differ markedly from those  in the other VSG 528 
classes. Our classification scheme and examination of hundreds of VSGs from multiple species 529 
suggests tha t the greater diversity that we have mapped out is likely close to the full  space of 530 
variability in structure  in T brucei , and likely also covers a substantial portion of the VSGs in 531 
related genomes like T.b. strain 927. It is quite possible that the VSGs in even  distan tly related 532 
species like T. vivax  will find substantial fit with most of the T. brucei  classifications , although 533 
currently  some VSGs in T. vivax  do not model well  with AlphaFold , suggesting that the re could 534 
exist novel structural classes  in this and other  species .  535 
In this sense, while it was mistakenly assume d the “VSG -folding problem” was understood 536 
decades ago, it is now likely that this is indeed beginning to be realized , and that further work 537 
across the breadt h of trypanosome species will  be able to full y map the antigenic space of these 538 
molecules . While  AlphaFold is clearly a primary choice for this structural mapping  (as perhaps are 539 
newer systems like Meta AI, [46]), it has to be noted that the system currently has limitations. One 540 
caveat is that only experimental structures  (or biochemical mapping)  can presently  establish  the 541 .

immunomodulatory. Additionally, as shown with attempts to model VSG sequences from T. vivax , 543 
the low confidence scores of some of these predictions suggest that AlphaFold is more robust at 544 
present when there exist s tructural templates of sequences in specific families, e.g., T. vivax  545 
experimental structures are needed as templates rather than relying solely  on T. brucei  templates.  546 
The next steps in understanding antigenic variation in the African trypanosome should  likely 547 
now focus on  mapping immunogenic epitopes on the VSG surfaces combined with antibody -VSG 548 
complex  structures. For the time being, this will likely rest in the realm of experimental structural 549 
biology, as neither AlphaFold nor a ny other software has yet succeeded in robustly predicting the 550 
structures of protein -protein interactions. Once many of these have been determined, efforts to 551 
categorize the classes and natures of epitopes and the modes of interaction with antibodies will be 552 
the final piece in th e puzzle to begin to develop a mechanistic framework for how this pathogen 553 
can continuously evade even the most potent immune response s. 554

VSG11 WT-Iodine crystals) was purified and crystallized by J.P.Z from clones and initial conditions 711 
produced by F.A.B . M.v.S. cloned VSG558 and J.P.Z. crystallized the VSG558 and solved its 712 
structure. AlphaFold models were produced by J.P.Z. and S.D.. C.E.S. conceived of the projects, 713 
aided in structural analysis, co -wrote the manuscript, and generated figures. All autho rs reviewed 714

Figure 4: Structure -based VSG Classification Scheme. The two broad subclasses of VSG 747 
protein discussed in the main text are denoted at the top of the figure (class A and class B). 748 
Subclasses are shown  in different colors with a collection of stru ctures illustrating each class 749 
contained in a color -coordinated box matching the subclass name. Structures are drawn as in 750 
previous figures with the exception that O-linked glycans are colored red like N -linked  glycans.  751 
Beneath each subclass name in gray are the clustering designations of the classes in previous 752 
papers discussed in the main text. Cyan backgrounds indicate structures solved prior to 2017 and 753 
orange  backgrounds indicate predicted models by the Alp haFold system.   754
