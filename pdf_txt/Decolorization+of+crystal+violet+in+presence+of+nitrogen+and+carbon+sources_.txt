Kinetics of Crystal Violet Fading
AP* Chemistry Big Idea 4, Investigation 11
An Advanced Inquiry Lab
Introduction
Crystal violet is a common, beautiful purple dye. In strongly basic solutions, the bright color of the dye slowly fades and the 
solution becomes colorless. The kinetics of this “fading” reaction can be analyzed by measuring the color intensity or absorbance 
of the solution versus time to determine the rate law.

Background
Crystal violet belongs to a class of intensely colored organic compounds called triphenylmethane dyes. The structure and 
color of crystal violet depend on pH, making it a valuable acid−base indicator as well as an excellent dye. The major structural 
form of crystal violet is the monovalent cation, abbreviated CV+, which is shown in Figure 1a. CV+ is the predominant form of 
crystal violet in the solid state and in aqueous solution across a broad range of pH values from pH 1 to 13. The positive charge 
shown	on	the	central	carbon	atom	in	Figure	1a	is	delocalized	 via	resonance	 to	the	three	nitrogen	atoms.	See	Figure	1b	for	one	of	
the three additional resonance forms with the positive charge on a nitrogen atom. Delocalization of the charge across the system 
of double bonds in the benzene rings stabilizes the carbocation and is responsible for the vibrant purple color of the dye.

storage	and	retrieval	system,	without	permission	in	writing	from	Flinn	Scientific,	Inc.In strongly basic solutions the purple CV+	cation	slowly	combines	 with	hydroxide	 ions	to	form	a	neutral	product,	CVOH,	
which is colorless (see Figure 2). The rate of this reaction (Equation 1) is slower than typical acid–base proton transfer reactions 
and depends on the initial concentration of both crystal violet and hydroxide ions.
 CV+	+	OH– →	CVOH	 Equation 1
 Purple Colorless
Exactly how much the rate changes as the reactant concentration is varied depends on the rate law for the reaction. In the case 
of the reaction of CV+	with	OH– ion, the rate law has the general form
	 Rate	=	k [CV+]n[OH–]m Equation 2
The exponents n and m are defined as the order of reaction for each reactant and k is the rate constant for the reaction at a 
particular temperature. The values of the exponents n and m must be determined by experiment. If the reaction is carried out under 
certain conditions then Equation 2 will reduce to the form
	 Rate	=	kʹ [CV+]n Equation 3
where kʹ	=	k	[OH–]m Equation 4
The constant kʹ is a new “pseudo” rate constant incorporating both the “true” rate constant k	and	the	[OH–]m term. Equation 3 is 
referred to as a pseudo-rate law because it is a simplification of the actual rate law, Equation 2.
The	pseudo-rate	 law	is	valid	when	the	concentration	 of	OH− ions is much greater than the concentration of CV+ ions. Under 
these	conditions	 the	[OH−]m term in Equation 2 will not change much over the course of the reaction and may be treated as a con -
stant in the rate equation.
Recall	that	the	absorbance	 for	a	specific	concentration	 of	a	solution	with	a	fixed	path	length	varies	directly	with	the	absorptiv -
ity	coefficient	of	the	solution.	 This	relationship	is	known	as	Beer’s	law.
	 A	=	abc Equation 5
where A is absorbance, a is the molar absorptivity coefficient, b is the path length in cm, corresponding to the distance light trav -
els through the solution, and c	is	the	concentration	 of	the	solution.	Beer’s	law	provides	the	basis	of	using	spectroscopy	 in	quantita -
tive analysis. Using this relationship, concentration and absorbance may be calculated if one variable is known while keeping a 
and b constant. This relationship is also extremely valuable in kinetics experiments, making it possible to follow the rate of disap -
pearance of a colored substance by measuring its absorbance as a function of time.
Experiment Overview
The purpose of this advanced inquiry lab activity is to use spectroscopy and graphical analysis to determine the rate law for 
the color-fading reaction of crystal violet with sodium hydroxide. The lab begins with an introductory activity (laboratory tech -
nique) for constructing a calibration curve of absorbance versus concentration for the dye crystal violet. A series of known or 
standard solutions is prepared from a stock solution of crystal violet and the absorbance of each solution is measured at an opti -
mum	wavelength.	 A	Beer’s	law	plot	of	absorbance	 as	a	function	of	concentration	 may	be	used	to	calculate	 the	concentration	 of	
any “unknown” solution of the dye in a rate law experiment. The procedure provides a model for guided-inquiry design of experi -
ments to determine the order of reaction with respect to both crystal violet and sodium hydroxide. Additional triphenylmethane 
dyes, malachite green and phenolphthalein, are also available for optional extension or cooperative class studies.– 3 – IN7644

most accurate and sensitive in the range 0.2–1.0.
 2. A calibration curve requires the use of several concentrations of the test solution. Using 25 μM CV solution as the stock 
solution, complete the following table to show how you would prepare 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 μM solutions of CV+.

Constructing a Calibration Curve for Crystal Violet
 1. Turn on the spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up for 15–20 minutes before use. Adjust the wavelength setting to the 
optimum wavelength determined in the Pre-Lab  section.
	2.	 Read	the	entire	procedure	 before	beginning	 and	construct	 an	appropriate	 data	table	to	record	measurements.  Note:  As 
part of a cooperative laboratory activity, your instructor may assign different groups to prepare different solutions. Each 
group will need to transcribe and analyze data for all of the solutions and resulting measurements in order to complete the 
guided-inquiry activity.
 3. Using a serological pipet for accuracy, prepare the series of standard dilutions of the crystal violet stock solution. Use the 
amounts calculated in the Pre-Lab  assignment. Lab Hint:  To avoid contaminating the stock solution, first use the pipet to 
add	the	required	amount	of	distilled	water	to	each	test	tube.	Rinse	the	pipet	three	times	with	the	stock	solution,	 and	then	
measure and add the required amount of stock solution to each test tube. Mix as needed.
 4. Measure and record the absorbance (A) of the stock solution and each standard solution (dilution) at the selected wavelength.
	5.	 Prepare	a	Beer’s	law	calibration	curve	of	absorbance	versus	concentration	for	crystal	violet.
Guided-Inquiry Design and Procedure
A. Rate of Reaction of Crystal Violet with Sodium Hydroxide
Form a working group with other students and discuss the following questions.
 1. Assume that the reaction of CV+	with	OH− ions (Equation 1)  proceeds to completion, that is, the solution turns colorless. 
What	percentage	 of	OH− ions will remain at the end of reaction if the initial crystal violet to sodium hydroxide mole ratio 
is 1:1? What if the initial ratio is 1:1000?
	2.	 Review	 the	conditions	 for	a	pseudo-rate	 law	in	the	Background  section. Which mole ratio described above should be used 
to ensure that the reaction between CV+	and	OH− ions can be treated using a pseudo-rate law to determine the reaction 
order n with respect to [CV+]?
 3. Consult your textbook or other resources for mathematical treatment and graphical analysis of experimental data of con -
centration versus time for disappearance of a reactant [A] in a reaction. Match each linear graph shown below with that 
expected if the reaction is (a) zero order, (b) first order, and (c) second order with respect to [A].

storage	and	retrieval	system,	without	permission	in	writing	from	Flinn	Scientific,	Inc. 4. Explain how the value of the pseudo-rate constant kʹ can be calculated from the appropriate linear graph shown above for a 
first-order reaction.
 5. Write a detailed step-by-step procedure for a kinetics experiment between crystal violet and sodium hydroxide to deter -
mine the order of reaction with respect to CV+. Include the materials, glassware and equipment that will be needed, safety 
precautions that must be followed, the concentrations of reactants, total volume of solution, order of mixing, timing, accu -
racy, etc.
	6.	 Review	 additional	 variables	 that	may	affect	the	reproducibility	 or	accuracy	 of	the	experiment	 and	how	these	variables	 will	
be controlled.
 7. Carry out the experiment and record results in an appropriate data table.
Analyze the results:  Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of CV+ over the course of the rate trial. 
Calculate the values of ln[CV+] and 1/[CV+] and perform the graphical analysis described in Question 3 to determine the order of 
reaction n and the value of the pseudo-rate constant kʹ.
B. Order of Reaction with Respect to Sodium Hydroxide
  1. The experiment can be extended to determine the order of reaction m	with	respect	to	[OH−] by varying the concentration 
of	hydroxide	 ions	[OH−]. Assume that the value of the pseudo-rate constant kʹ was measured for two different concentra -
tions	of	[OH−]. The value of kʹ was	found	to	be	0.13	at	[OH−]	=	0.2	M,	and	0.061	when	[OH−]	=	0.1	M.	Show	how	you	can	
rearrange and combine the following two equations (see Equation 4 ) to solve for m.
	 0.13	 =	kʹ	=	k[0.2]m	 and	 0.061	=	kʹ	=	k[0.1]m
 2. Propose or recommend the concentration of [CV+] that should be used in this part of the experiment when varying the 
hydroxide ion concentration. Explain.
 3. Working cooperatively with other student groups, identify appropriate concentrations of sodium hydroxide for two addi -
tional rate trials of the color-fading reaction between crystal violet and hydroxide ions. If needed, carry out some rough 
trial-and-error	 experiments	 to	make	sure	the	new	concentrations	 of	[OH−] will give reactions that occur at convenient rates, 
that is, neither too fast nor too slow.
	4.	 Review	additional	variables	that	may	influence	the	results	and	write	a	detailed	step-by-step	procedure	for	Part	B.
Analyze the results:  Combine the class data as needed. Graph the results as in Part A to determine the values of k ʹ at the new 
hydroxide ion concentrations. Use the mathematical treatment derived in the answer to Question 1 to calculate the reaction order 
m	with	respect	to	hydroxide	ions	[OH−].

Dye-Fading Reactions of Phenolphthalein and Malachite Green
Phenolphthalein, which is one of the most common acid−base indicators in general chemistry, belongs to the same general 
class of compounds as crystal violet. It is a triphenylmethane derivative. Malachite green, a beautiful green dye, also has the same 
general structure (see Figures 4 and 5). Delocalization of the charge from the central carbon atom in these structures across the 
system of pi bonds in the attached benzene rings stabilizes the ions and gives rise to intense absorption bands in the visible spec -
trum. At high pH values both phenolphthalein and malachite green undergo slow combination reactions with sodium hydroxide to 
form	colorless	 products,	 similar	to	the	reaction	of	crystal	violet.	Stock	solutions	 of	phenolphthalein	 and	malachite	 green	are	avail -
able	from	your	teacher.	Obtain	the	spectra	of	these	dyes	and	design	experiments	 to	verify	the	kinetics	of	their	decolorization	 reac-
tions at an appropriate wavelength and pH value.

AP Chemistry Review Questions
Integrating Content, Inquiry and Reasoning
Collision theory offers a simple explanation for how reactions occur—reacting molecules must first collide. In order for col -
liding molecules to be converted into products, they must collide with enough energy and with a suitable orientation to break 
existing bonds in the reactants and form new bonds in the products. Any factor that changes either the total number of collisions 
or the average energy of the colliding molecules should affect the reaction rate.
	1.	 Using	 collision	theory,	predict	how	increasing	 the	temperature	 should	affect	the	rate	of	a	chemical	 reaction.	 State	the	pre-
diction in the form of an hypothesis and explain your reasoning.
 2. Using collision theory, predict how increasing the concentration of a reactant should affect the rate of a chemical reaction. 
State	the	prediction	in	the	form	of	an	hypothesis	and	explain	your	reasoning.
Two general methods may be used to determine the rate law for a reaction. The graphical method used in this lab is an inte -
grated rate law experiment—it shows how the concentration of a reactant or product depends on time. An alternative method for 
determining the rate law relies on measuring the initial rate of a reaction for different initial concentrations of reactants. This alter -
native method may be called a differential rate law experiment. Consider a classic iodine clock reaction between iodide ions and 
persulfate ions (Equation 6).
 2I−(aq)	+	S2O82−(aq) → I2(aq)	+	2SO42−(aq) Equation 6
The following rate data was collected for different initial concentrations of iodide and persulfate ions.
Trial [I−] [S2O82−] Initial rate (mole/L zsec)
1 0.040 M 0.040 M 7.4 × 10−6
2 0.080 M 0.040 M 1.5 × 10−5
3 0.040 M 0.080 M 1.4 × 10−5
 3. Compare trials 1 and 2: How did the concentration of iodide ions change in these two trials, and how did the rate change 
accordingly? What is the reaction order for iodide ions?
 4. Which two trials should be compared to determine the order of reaction with respect to persulfate ions? What is the reac -
tion order for persulfate?
 5. Write the combined rate law for this version of an iodine clock reaction. Could the rate law have been predicted using the 
coefficients in the balanced chemical equation? Explain.– 7 –

Alignment to AP* Chemistry Curriculum Framework
Enduring Understanding and Essential Knowledge
 Atoms are so small that they are difficult to study directly; atomic models are constructed to explain experimental data on 
collections of atoms.
1D3:  The interaction of electromagnetic waves or light with matter is a powerful means to probe the structure of atoms and 
molecules, and to measure their concentration.
 Chemical changes are represented by a balanced chemical equation that identifies the ratios with which reactants react and 
products form.
3A2:  Quantitative information can be derived from stoichiometric calculations that utilize the mole ratios from the balanced 
chemical equations. The role of stoichiometry in real-world applications is important to note, so that it does not seem to 
be simply an exercise done only by chemists.
	Reaction	 rates	that	depend	on	temperature	 and	other	environmental	 factors	are	determined	 by	measuring	 changes	in	concen -
trations of reactants or products over time.
4A2:  The rate law shows how the rate depends on reactant concentrations.
Learning Objectives
4.2  The student is able to analyze concentration versus time data to determine the rate law for a zeroth-, first-, or second-
order reaction.
4.1  The student is able to design and/or interpret the results of an experiment regarding the factors (i.e., temperature, concen -
tration, surface area) that may influence the rate of a reaction.
Science Practices
1.4 The student can use representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively and quantitatively.
2.1 The student can justify the selection of mathematical routine to solve problems.
2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena.
4.2 The student can design a plan for collecting data to answer a particular scientific question.
5.1 The student can analyze data to identify patterns or relationships.
6.4 The student can make claims and predictions about natural phenomena based on scientific theories and models.– 9 –Teacher’s Notes continued

•	 Enough	 materials	 are	provided	 in	this	kit	for	24	students	working	in	pairs,	or	for	12	groups	of	students.	 For	best	results,	
schedule two 50-minute class periods for this guided-inquiry lab. An additional lab period would be needed for students to 
complete an optional inquiry investigation (see Opportunities for Inquiry ). The pre-laboratory assignment may be completed 
before coming to lab, and the results and analysis may be completed the day after the lab or as homework.
•	 Remind	 students	to	only	touch	the	cuvets	on	the	ribbed	sides.	If	using	test	tubes,	students	should	only	touch	the	very	top.	
Fingerprints	 will	give	false	absorbance	 measurements.	 Smudges	 can	be	cleaned	off	using	a	lint-free	wipe,	like	Kimwipes®, 
before placing the cuvet or test tube in the colorimeter or spectrophotometer.
•	 Data	collection	 for	a	duration	of	15	minutes	provides	 enough	of	a	range	of	data	to	give	accurate	results.	Measurements	
may be taken every 20 seconds.
•	 Remind	 students	to	begin	timing	 immediately 	after	mixing	the	crystal	violet	and	sodium	hydroxide.	 One	partner	may	start	
the clock while the other mixes the solution, transfers it a cuvet, wipes it clean, and places it in the instrument. This pro -
cess should be done within 20 seconds to give an accurate measurement of the initial concentration of crystal violet.
•	 Mohr	or	serological-type 	pipets	are	recommended 	for	preparation 	of	the	Beer’s	law	dilution	solutions	and	the	reaction	
solutions. Using graduated cylinders to measure and transfer the liquids does not give the precision needed to achieve con -
stant	values	of	the	rate	of	reaction.	 Serological	 pipets	are	considered	 “throw-away”	 pipets	by	the	medical	community	 and	
are very affordable. They can be reused several times before the graduations come off. Used as disposable pipets, however, 
they eliminate the need for dishwashing and save valuable time.
•	 During	 the	preparation	 of	the	Beer’s	law	concentrations	 in	the	Laboratory Technique  section, students should rinse the 
serological	 pipet	with	distilled	or	deionized	 water	between	measuring	 the	crystal	violet	and	DI	water.	One	option	is	to	
measure the required volumes of either solution first, then measure the required volumes of the other solution.
•	 The	use	of	computer-	or	calculator-based	technology	for	data	collection	and	analysis	is	suggested	for	this	experiment.
•	 Students	 may	benefit	from	a	review	of	the	principles	 of	light	absorption	 and	transmission.	 The	crystal	violet	solution	in	
this experiment has a purple color. That means that when ordinary “white” light is passed through the solution, only the 
violet color (wavelength) is transmitted. All of the other colors (wavelengths of light) are absorbed. The colorimeter or 
spectrophotometer sends a beam of monochromatic (one color or wavelength) light through the solution. The wavelength 
of light used in the sample data is 565 nm, corresponding to green light. This is the complementary color of the violet 
color of the solution and is almost totally absorbed. The beam of light is passed through the sample, and the intensity of 
the green light transmitted is measured electronically. The rest of the green light is absorbed by the solution. The greater 
the concentration of crystal violet in solution, the more green light the solution absorbs.
•	 The	absorption	 spectrum	 in	Figure	3	was	generated	 using	12.5	μM	crystal	violet.	The	reason	for	doing	this	is	to	ensure	that	
when data is gathered from the reaction of equal volumes of crystal violet and sodium hydroxide the maximum absorbance 
will	not	exceed	the	absorbance	 found	in	the	Beer’s	law	curve.	When	students	transform	 their	absorption	 data	into	concen -
tration,	the	slope	of	the	Beer’s	law	curve	will	more	closely	match	the	actual	concentration.
•	 The	experiment	 may	also	be	performed	 using	a	conventional	 spectrophotometer	 rather	than	colorimeter	 to	measure	absor -
bance	as	a	function	of	time.	Below	is	the	list	of	indicators	 and	their	corresponding	 maximum	 absorbance	 wavelengths	 to	
set for a conventional spectrophotometer.

Teaching Tips
•	 Crystal	 violet	is	purple	in	aqueous	solution	across	a	broad	range	of	pH	values	from	pH	1	to	13.	In	highly	acidic	solutions	
(pH <1), crystal violet does behave as an acid−base indicator. As shown in Figure 1b on page 1, there are two very weakly 
basic nitrogen atoms in the structure of CV+. In solutions of concentrated strong acids, pH <0, both of the nitrogen atoms 
can be protonated to give a diacid, CVH23+, which is yellow. As the pH slowly increases, CVH23+ undergoes stepwise 
deprotonation to form first CVH2+, which is greenish blue (pH 1), and then CV+ (purple) at pH 1.8.
•	 This	experiment	 may	be	used	to	explore	the	effects	of	chemical	 buildup	in	the	environment.	 The	environmental	 impact	of	
chemicals is a widely studied subject. The build-up of slow-decomposing molecules poses health risks to plant and animal 
life. Experiments to determine the decomposition rate provide scientists with key insight into the short- and long-term 
effects of certain chemicals.

	1.	 What	 would	be	the	optimum	 wavelength	 for	generating	 a	Beer’s	law	calibration	 curve	for	crystal	violet	and	measuring	
absorbance versus time for the reaction of CV+	with	OH–?	Explain	your	answer.	Recall	that	absorbance	 measurements	 are	
most accurate and sensitive in the range 0.2–1.0.
 There is a maximum absorbance value of about 1.56 at 590 nm. This wavelength would not be optimal because the absor -
bance is too high and will yield inaccurate results. An absorbance value of 1.0 is near 540 nm and 610 nm. Either wave -
length would be an option because the absorbance is high enough for the stock solution and that more dilute solutions 
would not have very low absorbance values.
 2. A calibration curve requires the use of several concentrations of the test solution. Using 25 μM CV solution as the stock 
solution, complete the following table to show how you would prepare 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 μM solutions of CV+. 
Assume that the final solution volume should be 10.0 mL in all cases.

Part A. Rate of Reaction of Crystal Violet with Sodium Hydroxide
Discussion Questions
 1. Assume that the reaction of CV+	with	OH− ions (Equation 1)  proceeds to completion, that is, the solution turns colorless. 
What	percentage	 of	OH− ions will remain at the end of reaction if the initial crystal violet to sodium hydroxide mole ratio 
is 1:1? What if the initial ratio is 1:1000?
  Reaction 1 Reaction 2
  CV+ + OH– → CVOH CV+ + OH– → CVOH
I 1 1 0
C –1 –1 +1
E 0 0 1
  % CV+ = 0/1 × 100 = 0% % CV+ = 0/1 × 100 = 0%
  % OH– = 0/1 × 100 = 0% % OH– = 999/1000 × 100 = 99.9%
	2.	 Review	 the	conditions	 for	a	pseudo-rate	 law	in	the	Background  section. Which mole ratio described above should be used 
to ensure that the reaction between CV+	and	OH− ions can be treated using a pseudo-rate law to determine the reaction 
order n with respect to [CV+]?
 In reaction 1, there will be 0% of both reactants remaining. The mole ratio of CV+:OH– is 1:1, therefore, all of the reac -
tants would be consumed in the reaction. In reaction 2, there will be 0% of CV+ remaining and 99.9% OH– remaining. The 
mole ratio remains the same but with the large excess of OH– in reaction 2, the amount changes very little. Reaction 2 fits 
the criterion to be used to find the pseudo-rate law because the concentration of hydroxide ions is effectively constant in 
the reaction.
 3. Consult your textbook or other resources for mathematical treatment and graphical analysis of experimental data of con -
centration versus time for disappearance of a reactant [A] in a reaction. Match each linear graph shown below with that 
expected if the reaction is (a) zero order, (b) first order, and (c) second order with respect to [A].
 Graph 1 is a first order reaction. Graph 2 is a zero order reaction. Graph 3 is a second order reaction.
 4. Explain how the value of the pseudo-rate constant kʹ can be calculated from the appropriate linear graph shown above for a 
first-order reaction.
 The pseudo-rate constant kʹ can be calculated from Graph 1 by adding a line of best-fit to the data points and taking the 
negative of the slope.
 5. Write a detailed step-by-step procedure for a kinetics experiment between crystal violet and sodium hydroxide to deter -
mine the order of reaction with respect to CV+. Include the materials, glassware and equipment that will be needed, safety 
precautions that must be followed, the concentrations of reactants, total volume of solution, order of mixing, timing, accu -
racy, etc.
 Set the colorimeter or spectrophotometer to 565 nm and zero the instrument using a “blank” of equal volumes of DI water 
and 0.02 M NaOH. Measure 10.0 mL of 25 μm crystal violet in a serological pipet and add it to a clean 50-mL beaker. 
Rinse the pipet with distilled water several times and also with the sodium hydroxide solution. Measure 10.0 mL of 0.02 
M sodium hydroxide in a serological pipet. Add the sodium hydroxide into the 50-mL beaker with crystal violet. Mix and 
immediately press “Collect” to begin timing. Transfer the reacting solutions to a cuvet and clean the outside with a lint-
free wipe. Place into the colorimeter and close the lid. Record absorbance measurements every 20 seconds for 15 minutes.I  1 1000 0

 *This is the initial concentration of the sodium hydroxide.
 Based on the shapes of the graphs and lines of best-fit, the order of reaction with respect to crystal violet is first-order. The 
graph of ln[CV] vs. Time provided a straight line which indicates a first-order reaction. Therefore, the value of kʹ = –slope 
of the graph: kʹ = 0.0013.
Part B. Order of Reaction with Respect to Sodium Hydroxide
Discussion Questions
	1.	 The	experiment	 can	be	extended	 to	determine	 the	order	of	reaction	m	with	respect	to	[OH−] by varying the concentration 
of	hydroxide	 ions	[OH−]. Assume that the value of the pseudo-rate constant kʹ was measured for two different concentra -
tions	of	[OH−]. The value of kʹ	was	found	to	be	0.13	at	[OH−]	=	0.2	M,	and	0.061	when	[OH−]	=	0.1	M.	Show	how	you	can	
rearrange and combine the following two equations (see Equation 4) to solve for m.
  At [O H–]	=	0.02 M At [O H–]	=	0.01 M
  0.13 = k ʹ = k[0.2]m 0.061  = kʹ = k[0.1]m
  kʹ	=	k[OH–]m k ʹ	=	k[OH–]m
  0.13	=	k[0.02]m 0.061 	=	k[0.01]m
 A ratio of the pseudo-rate constants of Trial 1:Trial 2:
  0.13 k[0.02]m
  ——– = ————  0.061  k[0.01]m
 2.13 	=	2m
   m = approx. 1 (1.09)
 When the concentration of sodium hydroxide was reduced by half, the value of the pseudo-rate constant decreased by half; 
therefore the order of reaction with respect to sodium hydroxide is first-order.– 15 –Teacher’s Notes continued
©	2013	Flinn	Scientific,	Inc.	 All	Rights	Reserved.	 IN7644 2. Propose or recommend the concentration of [CV+] that should be used in this part of the experiment when varying the 
hydroxide ion concentration. Explain.
 The concentration of CV+ should be the same in both sets of experiments, Parts A and B. Only one variable should be 
changed at a time in order to determine the effect each has on the reaction rate. If the concentrations of both CV+ and OH– 
are changed, it would be impossible to determine which reactant caused a change in the rate.
 3. Working cooperatively with other student groups, identify appropriate concentrations of sodium hydroxide for two addi -
tional rate trials of the color-fading reaction between crystal violet and hydroxide ions. If needed, carry out some rough 
trial-and-error	 experiments	 to	make	sure	the	new	concentrations	 of	[OH−] will give reactions that occur at convenient rates, 
that is, neither too fast nor too slow.
 Two possible concentrations of sodium hydroxide that can be used are 0.01 M and 0.005 M. These concentrations give 
convenient concentration ratios to determine the change in the value of kʹ.
	4.	 Review	any	additional	variables	that	may	influence	the	results	and	write	a	detailed	step-by-step	procedure	for	Part	B.
 In order to determine the order of reaction with respect to NaOH, the concentration of NaOH needs to be changed and the 
effect on the kʹ calculated. The concentration of crystal violet needs to remain unchanged.
 First the colorimeter will be zeroed using a “blank” of equal volumes of DI water and 0.01 M NaOH.
 To make10 mL of 0.01 M NaOH, measure 5.0 mL of 0.02 M sodium hydroxide in a serological pipet and add it to a clean 
50-mL beaker. Rinse the pipet several times with DI water. Measure 5.0 mL of DI water with the pipet and add to the bea -
ker. Mix. This will give 0.01 M NaOH (half of the initial reaction).
 Clean the pipet with small portions of the crystal violet solution. Measure 10.0 mL of 25 μm crystal violet solution in the 
pipet. Transfer this to the 50-mL beaker containing 0.01 M NaOH, mix, and immediately press “Collect” to begin timing. 
Transfer the mixture from the beaker to a cuvet and clean the outside with a lint-free wipe. Place the cuvet into the color -
imeter and close the lid. Record absorbance values every 20 seconds for 15 minutes.
 After the absorbance values have been recorded, the values need to be converted to concentration of crystal violet by using 
the Beer’s law curve. The concentration versus time data will be manipulated and graphed to determine the value of kʹ.– 16 –

Answers to AP Chemistry Review Questions
Collision theory offers a simple explanation for how reactions occur—reacting molecules must first collide. In order for col -
liding molecules to be converted into products, they must collide with enough energy and with a suitable orientation to break 
existing bonds in the reactants and form new bonds in the products. Any factor that changes either the total number of collisions 
or the average energy of the colliding molecules should affect the reaction rate.
	1.	 Using	 collision	theory,	predict	how	increasing	 the	temperature	 should	affect	the	rate	of	a	chemical	 reaction.	 State	the	pre-
diction in the form of an hypothesis and explain your reasoning.
 If the temperature of a reaction increases, then the rate of the reaction should also increase. This hypothesis is based on 
the idea that increasing the temperature increases the average speed of the molecules, which should in turn, increase both 
the number of collisions and, more importantly, the average energy of the collisions.
 2. Using collision theory, predict how increasing the concentration of a reactant should affect the rate of a chemical reaction. 
State	the	prediction	in	the	form	of	an	hypothesis	and	explain	your	reasoning.
 If the concentration of reactants increases, then the rate of the reaction should also increase. This hypothesis is based on the 
idea that increasing the number of molecules present in solution should increase the rate of collisions between molecules.– 18 –

Two general methods may be used to determine the rate law for a reaction. The graphical method used in this lab is an inte -
grated rate law experiment—it shows how the concentration of a reactant or product depends on time. An alternative method for 
determining the rate law relies on measuring the initial rate of a reaction for different initial concentrations of reactants. This alter -
native method may be called a differential rate law experiment. Consider a classic iodine clock reaction between iodide ions and 
persulfate ions (Equation 6).
 2I−(aq)	+	S2O82−(aq) → I2(aq)	+	2SO42−(aq) Equation 6
The following rate data was collected for different initial concentrations of iodide and persulfate ions.
Trial [I−] [S2O82−] Initial rate (mole/L zsec)
1 0.040 M 0.040 M 7.4 × 10−6
2 0.080 M 0.040 M 1.5 × 10−5
3 0.040 M 0.080 M 1.4 × 10−5
 3. Compare trials 1 and 2: How did the concentration of iodide ions change in these two trials, and how did the rate change 
accordingly? What is the reaction order for iodide ions?
 In trials 1 and 2, the concentration of persulfate ions was held constant, while the concentration of iodide ions was 
doubled. The rate increased by a factor of two when [ I–] was doubled. Therefore, the reaction is first order with respect to 
iodide.
 4. Which two trials should be compared to determine the order of reaction with respect to persulfate ions? What is the reac -
tion order for persulfate?
 Comparing the rates of trials 1 and 3 will show how the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of persulfate 
ions. In trials 1 and 3, the concentration of iodide ions was held constant while the concentration of persulfate ions was 
doubled. The rate increased by a factor of two when [S2O82–] was doubled. Therefore, the reaction is first order with 
respect to persulfate.
 5. Write the combined rate law for this version of an iodine clock reaction. Could the rate law have been predicted using the 
coefficients in the balanced chemical equation? Explain.
 Rate = k[ I–][S2O82–]
 The rate law cannot be predicted simply by looking at the balanced chemical equation. The exponents are not the same as 
the coefficients in the balanced equation.
