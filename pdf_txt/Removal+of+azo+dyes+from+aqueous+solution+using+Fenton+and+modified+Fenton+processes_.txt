Background: Fenton (Fe2+ and H2O2) and modified Fenton (Fe3+ and H2O2) are two popular methods used in advanced oxidation 
processes (AOP) and degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as dye compounds. In these processes, Fe2+ and Fe3+ as 
catalysts and H2O2 as the oxidizing agent are added to the reactor.
Objectives: The aim of the current study is to assess the abovementioned methods for removal of Reactive Red 198 and Blue Reactive 19 
from aqueous solutions.
Materials and Methods: This research was carried out using lab-scale. After preparation of RB-19 and RR-198 stock solutions (1000 ppm), optimum pH and temperature were determined within the range of (3-11) and (15°C - 40°C) respectively , and specific amounts of Fe
2+ 
and Fe3+ (0.8, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 32 mM) were prepared by adding FeSo4. 7H2O and FeCl3, and H2O2 30% W/W (2, 5, 11, 23, 47 and 94 mM) were 
added to the solutions to establish the H2O2/Fe2+, Fe3+ molar ratios. Standard jar tests were conducted using jar test apparatus. After 
sedimentation time, samples were filtered through a 0.45 µm fiber membrane, and then final dye concentrations were measured using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer.Results: The highest dye removal efficiency in both Fenton and modified Fenton methods were obtained at the optimum pH = 3, optimum 
reaction time of 10 minutes, optimum temperature at 25°C and H
2O2/Fe2+ and H2O2/Fe3+ concentrations of 11.3 and 5.1 mM, respectively . 
In the Fenton reaction the maximum efficiency was obtained at 94.70% and 99.31% for reactive red 198 and reactive blue 19, respectively . Moreover, by the modified Fenton method the maximum removal efficiency for reactive red 198 and reactive blue 19 was 94.8% and 99.43%.Conclusions: Fenton and modified Fenton processes could be used as very effective methods for removal of reactive red 198 and blue 
reactive 19 from aqueous solutions.

Textile and dyeing industrial are considered as the 
major sources of water consumption. According to the 
production rate, water consumption varies between 25 - 250 m
3/ton of product. The resulting wastewater con-
tains BOD, COD and synthetic dyes (1, 2), and discharge of contaminated effluent without any treatment into the environment creates depressed photosynthesis and aquatic plant demise which characteristics are consid-ered as environmental threats (3). Dyes are substances with complex structures which contain atoms: electron acceptors such as chromophore or electron donors such as ecsocrimium, which determine its strength and solu-bility in water (4, 5). Based on the application, dyes are categorized as Watt, reactive, direct, cation, acidic and disperse, of which Azo dyes are found in more than 50% of dyes (6, 7). Azo reactive dyes are anionic and soluble in water. Because of their variety of colors, easy utiliza-tion, good stability during washing and low energy con-sumption, Azo dyes are applied more frequently in the textile industry (5, 8). These dyes have strong resistance to photolysis and chemical decomposition, and in some cases there are special components in their structures that have carcinogenic and mutagenic consequences (5, 9). Even the presence of a small quantity of dye (less than 1 ppm) in water has adverse effects. Synthetic dyes are used in abundance by textile (60%), paper making (10 %) and plastics industries. Now , over 10000 varied types of commercial pigments and dyes are produced annually , about 7 × 10
5 tons (10). Their absorption into biological 
masses are very weak and there is no decomposition in aerobic conditions. Reactive red 198 and blue reactive 19 are mono Azos which are used in textile plants in Iran Jafari Mansoorian H et al.
Health Scope. 2014;3(2):e155072(3, 11, 12). Different technologies are applied to decrease 
absorption of these dyes into the environment such as ion exchange, chemical sedimentation, electrochemical reduction, advanced oxidation, membrane process and absorption (13-15).
The limitations of the available technologies include 
dense solution disposal, high energy consumption, high operation costs, excessive production of sludge, expen-sive facilities (16-18). Therefore, finding new and effec-tive alternatives is necessary to remove contaminants from aquatic environments. One effective technique is advanced oxidation which can be used to remove toxic and resistant chemicals and reprocess them into mineral form to release carbon dioxide and oxygen. Advanced chemical oxidation processes such as chemical, photo-chemical, photocatalytic methods and electrochemical methods (UV/O
3, UV/H2O2, Fenton, modified Fenton, and 
ultrasound) are decrepitating and produce hydroxyl rad-icals. In this process, hydroxyl radicals using Fe(II) and Fe(III) catalysts are generated easily as follows (19-21):
Fenton reactions:1. Fe
2+ + H2O2→ Fe3++ OH•+ OH-
2. Fe3+ + H2O2→ Fe-OOH2+ + H+
3. Fe-OOH2+→ Fe3+ + O2H•
4. Fe3++ O2H•→ Fe2+ + O2+ H+
5. Fe2+ + OH•→ Fe3++ OH-
6. H2O2+ OH•→ H2O + O2H•
7. OH• + Reactive dye production
Reactions related to modified Fenton process:1. Fe
3+ + H2O2→ Fe2+ + HO2• + H+
2. HO2•→O2•-+ H+
3. HO2• + Fe3+→ Fe2++ O2+ H+
Efficiency of the advanced oxidation process is ds on the 
oxidation rate of hydroxyl radical. These radicals have high reaction rates, oxidation potential, low selectivity for organic components and will destroy contaminants in four ways: (i) addition of OH
- to structure of contami-
nant (ii) hydrogen absorption (iii) electron transmis-sion (iv) reaction between free radicals that can lead to the formation of stable compounds. Among the various processes of advanced oxidation, using the Fenton (H
2O2/
Fe2+) and modified Fenton (H2O2/Fe3+) methods have 
greater advantages, such as simple operation, low reac-tion time, using of coagulation and flocculation process-es, non-toxic compound production, economic viability , and possibility of utilization at different scales. Disadvan-tages include costly treatment processes and disposal of sludge, ferrous ions are consumed faster than produced, the process is limited to low pH range, and deactivation of iron ions due to bonding of iron ions with various re-agents such as anion phosphate, oxidation of the prod-uct as well as further water pollution due to existence of catalysts such as iron salt. The main steps involved in the Fenton process are (i) oxidation, (ii) neutralization, (iii) flocculation and (iv) sedimentation (22-24). Research shows that modified Fenton is very effective in treating colored wastewater but so far little research has been done using this method.
2. Objectives
This paper presents a brief review on the role of Fenton 
and modified Fenton reactions in the removal of contam-inants (blue reactive 19 and reactive red 198) from aque-ous solutions.
3. Materials and Methods
Reactive dyes were bought from Alvan Sabet Company 
(Iran); other chemical material was obtained from Mer-ck Company (Germany). The chemical structures and a number of the physicochemical properties of the dyes used are listed in Table 1. 
This research was carried out using lab-scale in chemis-
try laboratory of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences. The advanced oxidation experiments were started in a Plexiglas reactor (1 L) as batch system. Ranges of experi-mental parameters are given in Table 2. After prepara-tion of RB-19, RR-198 Stock solutions (1000 ppm), work-ing solutions were made by dissolving stock solution in deionized water. After determination of optimum pH within range of (3-11) and temperature (15°C - 40°C), spe-cific amounts of Fe
2+ and Fe3+ (0.8, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 32 mM) 
were prepared by adding FeSo4.7H2O and FeCl3, and de-
termined amounts of H2O2 30% W/W (2, 5, 11, 23, 47 and 94 
mM) were added to the solution to create the H2O2/Fe2+ 
and H2O2/Fe3+ molar ratios. Standard Jar Tests were con-
ducted using jar test apparatus (model OSK8996). After sedimentation time, supernatant samples were collected from the solution using a 50 mL pipet. Collected samples were filtered through a 0.45 µm fiber membrane, then final dye concentrations were measured using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (optima SP-3000 plus) at 590 nm for RB-19 and 518 nm for RR-198. The dye removal percentage (R%) was calculated as follows (Equation 1): 
Equation 1.
Where C0 is the initial concentration (mg/L) and C is the 
final dye concentration (mg/L).
4. Results
It has been established that pH has a significant influence 
on the performance of oxidation processes. In the present study the effect of pH (3-11) on removal of two dyes, reactive red 198 (RR198) and blue reactive 19 (RB 19), were investi-gated. Figure 1 shows that the highest removal efficiency for the dyes studied occurred at pH 3 for both processes, modified Fenton and Fenton. Final values of pH samples at the end of the experiments are presented in Figure 2.Jafari Mansoorian H et al.3
Health Scope. 2014;3(2):e15507Optimum reaction time for Fenton and modified Fen-
ton methods depends on the initial concentration and variance of catalyst dosage. Dye removal efficiency was investigated at fixed pH and H
2O2/Fe2+, Fe3+ ratio condi-
tions. As it can be seen in Figure 3, optimum reaction time for both processes was obtained at 10 minutes.
Temperature has a positive effect on treatment effi-
ciency; hence, six temperatures were investigated in this study . As shown in Figure 4, the best removal efficiency for both methods was obtained at 25°C. In addition, this effect was studied in various molar ratios. Maximum dye removal in optimum molar ratios in Fenton and modified Fenton methods were obtained at H
2O2/Fe2+ = 
11.3 and H2O2/Fe3+ = 5.1, respectively (Figures 5 to 8). To 
determine the effect of dye concentration on removal efficiency , mentioned dyes were examined at three con-centrations (10, 50 and 500 mg/L). Figures 5 to 8 reveal dye removal efficiency in various concentrations. As can be seen, removal efficiency was increased by increasing dye concentration.

Health Scope. 2014;3(2):e1550765. Discussion
The present study has evaluated a number of parame-
ters such as pH, contact time, temperature, initial hydro-
gen peroxide H2O2 concentration and iron (II), iron (III) 
concentrations.
5.1. Effect of pH
pH is one of the effective parameter on dye removal ef-
ficiency in Fenton and modified Fenton processes. pH plays an important role in production of radicals that are effective in increase of oxidation efficiency . It has been proven that the Fenton reactions in acidic pH are more effective than neutral pH (25); On the other hand, oxida-tion reactions are slower in neutral pH due to hydroxyl-ation of iron (26). Figures 1 and 2 show that the maximum removal percentage reached is 95% in pH = 3, thus the optimum pH was obtained as 3 for all of samples. In pH > 3, because of Fe(III) sedimentation, Fenton efficiency decreases, the synthetic hydroxide produced can hydro-lyze the available hydrogen peroxide to other products (O
2 and H2O) that subsequently cause oxidation and hy -
droxyl ions decline. Moreover in pH > 3, the Fe(II) [Fe(II)(H
2O)6]2+substance can react with hydrogen peroxide 
peroxide better than the Fe(II) [Fe(II) (OH) (H2O)52+] sub-
stance (27, 28). In lower pH, the additionally droxide ions react in reverse which leads to further Fe(III) production. As shown in Figure 8 below (27).
8. Fe
3+ + H2O2→ Fe – OOH2+ + H+
As shown above, the generation of Fe(III) to Fe(II) is 
prohibited and as a result the available Fe(II) concentra-tion producing hydroxyl radical was declined. These results are in accordance with other reported research (29). In the Fenton method, iron ions will become sedi-ment in higher pH in the form of ferric hydroxide. In low pH iron ions can form a stable substance with hydrogen peroxide leading to the inactivation of the catalyst and subsequently removal efficiency decreases. Acidic solu-tions have a propensity to produce hydrogen peroxide (Equation 9), but according to equation 10, in low pH, the number of active sites for hydrogen peroxide is de-clined. In pH < 3 hydrogen peroxide forms ecsoniumion and remains constant. According to other research, pH = 3 because of renewed production of Fe(II) via reaction be-tween Fe(III) and hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton process has less effect (10, 22, 23).

2+ 2H++ 2e-→ H2O2
10. H2O2+ 2H+ + 2e-→ 2H2O
11. H2O2+ H+→ H3O2+
 Figure 5 shows the final pH of the solution and it can 
be concluded that by increasing the iron concentration, the pH decreases from 4 to 2.5; this may be due to the hy -
drolysis of water and production of further H
+ ions (28). 
Yuang et al. obtained optimum pH = 2 - 4 for treatment of pharmacy wastewater; also the optimum pH for dye removal was 3 - 4 (30, 31).5.2. The Effect of Contact Time
To study the optimum time and its effect in the Fen-
ton and modified Fenton processes, experiments were performed for 10 to 80 minutes to determine optimum time of the Fenton and modified Fenton efficiency in dye removal. As shown in Figure 3, maximum efficiency was attained at 10 minutes for both of the processes which was more than 94%. It is clear that removal efficiency in-crease was linear and slow thereafter. Linear increase of dye removal efficiency can be related to chemical oxida-tion of dye by OH. In advanced chemical oxidation, with methods other than the Fenton process, OH production in the environment is continuous, but in the Fenton pro-cess high concentrations of OH are producedin the first minutes of the process (29). Fenton oxidation of organic compounds showed that in the early stages the initial rate of mineralization was fast with Fenton reagents, due to the immediate formation of hydroxyl radicals, where the color could obviously be reduced. It demonstrated that the recalcitrant organic compounds which were in the wastewater had been oxidized by HO
• after reaction 
time of 60 minutes, resulted in the curve slightly ascend-ing (21). In the Fenton oxidation system, the hydroxyl rad-icals made, which had extremely high oxidizing ability , could oxidize into hardness with the decomposition of organic compounds in a short time. Also after the rapid and slow mixing, large amounts of pinpoint 
fl
ocs were 
consistently observed and took a very long time to settle down. These tiny amounts of 
fl
oc frequently interfered 
with color and measurement. The majority of color was generally removed after rather short oxidation times: one minute (26), 10 minutes (18), and 15 minutes (27).
5.3. The Effect of Temperature
Although temperature has a positive effect on treat-
ment efficiency in the Fenton process, it has a less effect than other factors. Very low or high temperature has ad-verse results on the efficiency process (28). Figure 5 shows the highest removal efficiency at 25°C. Goi et al. (32) re-ported that 30˚C is as an optimum temperature for de-composition of silicicacid. Also it has been proven that temperatures between 20°C - 30°C can be used as the best temperature because of high efficiency (32). Zhang et al. concluded that COD removal efficiency was increased gradually by varying temperature from 15°C -35°C (28).Weng et al. reported that dye decomposition rate was less at lower temperatures (33). The optimum temperature was estimated to be 45°C (31). During the process, tem-perature hadtwo effects on accumulation of hydrogen peroxide peroxide: a) when temperature is increased, dissolving of oxygen decreased; b) peroxide had a low solubility in higher temperature. When temperature in-creased to more than 30°C, dye decomposition declined because of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Also the negative effect of temperature on contaminant re-Jafari Mansoorian H et al.7
Health Scope. 2014;3(2):e15507moval can be described as low concentration of dissolved 
oxygen (DO) and spontaneous decomposition of perox-ide in high temperatures (20). Usually when temperature increases, hydrogen peroxide concentration decreases, because increasing the temperature reduces DO to waste-water. Devi et al. reported that by increasing temperature from 30 to 50°C, Alizarin Red decomposed very well (34). Ayodele et al. (19) showed that phenol decomposition in-creased with varying the temperature from 22°C to 27°C; it also proved that by increasing the temperature, oxida-tion and mineralization rates improved by decreasing the hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II). This phenomenon can be due to the increasing reaction between hydrogen per-oxide and any sort of iron ions that finally lead to genera-tion of hydroxyl radicals or a high capacity of iron species (19).
5.4. The Effect of H2O2
In the Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide plays an es-
sential role in contaminant removal efficiency . Figure 3 shows the effect H
2O2 concentration on reactive dye re-
moval percentage from colored solutions. An increase in H
2O2 concentration from 2 to 5 mM causes an increasing 
in the dye removal percentage. Improvement in dye re-moval can be attributed to increase of hydroxyl radicals as a result of growing growth (31). When H
2O2 concentra-
tion increases, the reaction time gets shorter. Minimum removal efficiency was observed in higher concentra-tions of H
2O2 (> 5 mM). The slow decomposition of re-
active dye at higher concentrations of H2O2 was due to 
the conversion of the generated hydroxyl radicals to hy -
droxyl ions, reaction of hydroxyl radicals, prohibition of its formation and H
2O2 dissociation with oxygen and H2O 
that change precipitate Fe3+ ions. The sequences above 
are in accordance with the following equations (35):
12. H2O2→ HO• + HO•
13. Fe2+ + HO-→ Fe3+ + OH-
14. [Fe3+] [OH-] →Ksp Fe(OH)3
In other words, the deactivation of Fe2+ takes place at 
higher dosages of H2O2, thus giving a brownish yellow 
precipitate at higher dosages (29). Zhang et al. (28)re-ported that efficiency of hydrogen peroxide for remov -
ing organic materials in the leachate decreased with the increase of Fenton's reagent dosage. At a high dosage of H
2O2, the decrease in removal efficiency was due to the 
hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of H2O2 (Equations 15 
and 16) and the recombination of the hydroxyl radical (Equation 17) (10):
15. HO
• + H2O2→HO2• + H2O
16. HO2• + HO• →H2O + O2
17. 2HO•→ H2O2
According to the literature, stepwise H2O2 addition 
could be more e
ff
ective than applying a large initial dose. 
This could be due to scavenging of OH• by H2O2, accord-
ing to reaction 18 (36):
18. OH• + H2O2 →HO2• + H2OReaction 18 contends better with reaction seven at high-
er concentrations of H2O2, reducing the oxidation rate of 
the target dye compound. Hydroxyl radical concentra-
tion increased when the H2O2/Fe2+ ratio increased that 
led to greater oxidation of dye. In this study , H2O2 dosage 
in the Fenton and modified Fenton processes were cho-sen as 11 and 5 mM as the optimum dosage, respectively .
5.5. The Effect of Iron Concentration
There are no hydroxyl radicals devoid of ions, so the 
iron ion concentration is essential because increasing the hydroxyl radicals and the coagulation phenomenon lead to a decrease of contaminants. Fenton efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the Fe(II) and Fe(III) concen-tration, since hydroxyl radical concentration [the same key oxidant] was increased by increasing the Fe(II) con-centration. Hydrogen peroxide is not strong enough to oxidize big molecules such as pigments in wastewa-ter dye without the presence of Fe(III) (37). By adding a quantity of Fe(III), removal efficiency will increase. Wang et al. reported that Fe(II) ions reduce COD amount by in-creasing Fe(II) (0.33 mM), where COD removal efficiency reached 43% from 19% (38). Zhou et al. found that methy -
lene red removal was increased from 45% to 75% in pres-ence of Fe(II) at 10 minutes (39). The effect of ferric and ferrous dosage on removal efficiency is shown in Figures 3 and 4; the plots illustrate that an increase in iron ion concentration, results in a decrease in the percentage of dye removal. The use of high concentrations of Fe
2+ (for a 
given hydrogen peroxide concentration) accelerated the rate of decomposition of the hydrogenperoxide generat-ed perhydroxyl radicals [HO
2•] which is considered to be 
the rate limiting step, while lower doses of Fe2+ favored 
the reaction to generate OH• which is mor ereactive than 
HO2• radicals. Beyond the dosage, 2 mM inactivation of 
the Fe2+ occurred owing to instantaneous formation of 
hydroxyl ion in accordance with the following reaction 
(33):
19. OH• + Fe2+ →OH- + Fe3+
This takes place at a faster rate than the formation of 
hydroxyl radical from Fe2+ and peroxide. In conclusion, 
more reduction in dye removal was observed as more cat-
alyst was added earl in the reaction. The Fenton reaction occurred during the first 10 - 40 minutes. Then, the rate of Fenton reaction due to production of Fe
+2 by Fe+3 became 
slower and decolorization stopped (37). By increasing the iron ions above these values, removal efficiency did not increased because of the tendency of the hydroxyl radi-cals to react with Fe
2+and H2O2 in the oxidation-reduction 
reaction (29). In this paper, Fe2+ and Fe3+ dosage of 3 and 
1 mM were selected as the optimum dosage respectively .
5.6. The Effect of Dye Concentration
Dye concentration is effective on dye removal percent-
age. Figure 8 shows the effect of various dye concentra-Jafari Mansoorian H et al.
Health Scope. 2014;3(2):e155078tions (10, 50, 500 mg/L) on removal efficiency [pH = 3, 
Fe(II) and Fe(III) concentration 50 mg/L, contact time of 10 minutes]. The line reveals that an increase in the dye concentration from 10 to 500 mg/L, reduces the percent-age of dye removal, because by increasing the concentra-tion and keeping the H
2O2 value stable, the hydroxyl radi-
cals produced also become stable, thereby the removal percentage will reduce (29, 36). RR-198 and RB-19 removal percentage was determined in 50 mg/L of dye. The Pres-ent study was performed with the aim of evaluating the Fenton and modified Fenton processes in removal of re-active red 198 and Reactive Blue 19 from aqueous environ-ments. The effect of various operating parameters such as H
2O2/Fe2+, H2O2/Fe3+, pH, reaction time, temperature 
and initial concentration of dye was investigated. The results of this study showed that the most effective dye removal agents are H
2O2/Fe2+, H2O2/Fe3+, equal to 11/3 and 
5/1 mM at pH = 3 respectively . Dye removal efficiency for reactive red 198 and Reactive Blue 19 utilizing the Fenton and modified Fenton processes were 99.43, 99.31, 94.8 and 90.98%, respectively (initial dye concentration 50 mg/L and reaction time of 10 minutes). The findings of this study showed that removal efficiency reduced with increase of dye concentration in fixed conditions for oth-er parameters. Finally , it can be concluded that the modi-fied Fenton process is superior to the Fenton process for dye removal from aqueous solutions.
