211 Abstract
12 Drainage from abandoned mines is one factor greatly affecting the streams and vegetation in and 
13 around Pittsburgh and the Appalachian Mountains where coal mining occurred. This drainage may be 
14 more acidic, alkaline, or metal based. Different methods for remediation exist. Passive remediation is 
15 one method used to naturally allow the metals to precipitate out and aid in cleaning up the water. The 
16 goal of this study is to sample different holding ponds in a sequential passive remediation system and 
17 determine microbial communities present at each site of an abandoned coal mine drainage (CMD) site. 
18 16s rRNA gene sequencing of the sediment indicated the most abundant phyla at each of the 5 ponds 
19 and wetlands area included Proteobacteria (36-43%), Bacteroidetes (12-37%), Firmicutes (3-11%), and 
20 Verrucomicrobia (6-11%). Analysis of genera between the first, and most polluted pond includes 
21 Solitalea, Pedosphaera, and  Rhodocyclus; while the microbial community from the wetlands site at the 
22 end of the remediation system included Ignavibacterium, Pelotomaculum, and Petrimonas. The results 
23 of our microbial community composition study of sediment from a passive treatment system are in line 
24 with organisms commonly found in sediment regardless of iron oxide precipitation, while others are 
25 preferentially found in the less polluted wetlands site.

329 Introduction
30 Excavation of coal from the earth has been taking place for many years. As demands change and 
31 resources are consumed many of these mines are shut down and the entrances sealed. Often times the 
32 network of tunnels begin to fill with water and eventually ends up flowing into an established water 
33 way. Coal mines often contain ferrous iron and as the water comes in contact with it, the iron is 
34 dissolved into the water. When oxygenated, the ferrous iron is converted to ferric iron and is easily 
35 recognized by the reddish-orange color. This precipitate settles to the bottom of the river bed and 
36 begins to coat the surroundings. Additionally, flora and fauna are affected by changes to pH, heavy 
37 metals, and a reduction in the amount of dissolved oxygen present (Senko et al. 2008; Branter and 
38 Senko 2014). Metagenomics of this type of mine drainage (MD) sediment is of great interest (Klein et al. 
39 2013).
40 In western Pennsylvania, CMD contributes to a multitude of changes that other organisms must face. 
41 Abandoned mines may also leach out other dissolved metal ions such as Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, along 
42 with low valency iron cations (Rakotonimaro et al. 2018; Nancucheo et al. 2017; Pinto et al. 2018). 
43 Metagenomics of microbial communities found in soil from abandoned coal mines the Appalachian 
44 mountains includes organisms from the phyla of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, 
45 Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (Brantner and Senko 2014; Sanchez-Andrea et al. 
46 2014). 
47 Bioremediation is often used in areas of MD. Many scientists in the Appalachians are studying ways in 
48 which MD and CMD contaminated soil and water can be cleaned and treated. One method is the 
49 fabrication of soil. This often involves the mixing of organic material with soil to introduce new microbes 
50 and nutrients to the affected earth (Kalevitch and Kefeli 2013).  Another possible treatment plan 
51 includes phytoremediation where select vegetation is grown in the contaminated soil, such as the Page 3 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
452 growth of Phragmites to chelate the heavy metals (Guo and Cutright 2015). The vegetation used must 
53 be matched with the unique combinations of metals found in the environment (Kim and Lee 2010). In 
54 addition, studies have shown that combining microorganisms along with suitable plants can influence 
55 metal uptake by the plants (Kuffner et al 2008; Becerra-Castro et al 2012). Nancucheo, et al. 2017 states 
56 that the use of sulfidogenic microorganisms for bioremediation, particularly in areas affected by acid 
57 MD may help with the redevelopment of these metal-rich and acidic environments. Treatment 
58 strategies often use microbes that metabolize these metals and sulfur compounds (Klein et al. 2013). 
59 These are a few types of the methods currently being researched for bioremediation of MD soil.
60 Passive water treatment systems are one way naturalists are trying to limit the amount of heavy metal 
61 water entering into streams and rivers. In southwestern Pennsylvania, a passive water treatment system 
62 was completed in 2009 to help clean-up the CMD and iron flowing into Chartiers Creek (Allegheny Land 
63 Trust 2018). At this site approximately 5600-7500 liters per minute of MD water are treated in a passive 
64 system that utilizes gravity to treat the iron discharge. The system designed by Bob Hedin, allows the 
65 water to pass through 5 sequential ponds followed by a wet-land area before finally flowing into 
66 Chartiers Creek. Precipitation of iron (III) oxide can be seen in many of the early ponds. The flow pattern 
67 of the ponds has been modeled and areas of low flow are noted (Buxton 2018). Environmental data was 
68 not reported by the authors at this time as part of this study, however water was collected with the 
69 intent of determining metal ion concentration from it at a later date. Information regarding pH, 
70 temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and conductivity has been collected from other groups 
71 surveying the system (Kester  2019). Much of the environmental chemistry data presented on the 
72 website is a result of Ed Schroth and other educational groups. 
73 The purpose of this study is to sample and describe the microbial communities found in the various 
74 ponds and wetland areas of the passive MD site in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.Page 4 of 25

575 Material and Methods
76 Location and collection of sediment
77 The sampling of MD contaminated sediment was from Wingfield Pines Passive remediation treatment 
78 Figure 1 (coordinates: 40.341362 - -80.109656; Google Maps). Each pond is numbered following the flow 
79 of water through the system. Sediment was collected by using a long reach pole with a 100ml beaker 
80 attached to the end. The beaker was dipped into the pond and a single, undisturbed scoop of sediment 
81 was collected and stored in labeled clean sterile bags. Excess air was carefully removed from the bag 
82 and sealed on-site. The beaker was cleaned between each sample. Upon arrival to the lab, 2 grams of 
83 sediment from each bag was measured out for DNA extraction. 
84 Isolation of genomic DNA
85 Genomic DNA was isolated from 0.5g of each sample immediately upon returning to the lab. The Zymo 
86 soil microbe Quick DNA kit (D6010)  was used and the directions were followed as indicated. DNA from 
87 each site was labeled and stored in the -20oC for further processing. Concentrations of nucleic acids 
88 were determined using a UV-VIS Spectrometer, measuring absorption (@ 260 nm) and sent for genomic 
89 sequence analysis. Extractions were performed in duplicate.
90 Sequencing reactions
91 DNA was aliquoted and sent to Molecular Research LP (MR DNA) Lab in Clearwater Texas, by overnight 
92 shipping. For each sample, the V4 variable region of the 16srRNA gene was amplified using 515(F- 
93 GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806 R (5’ GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT)(Caporaso et al. 2012) . PCR 
94 conditions are as follows: 94oC for 3 minutes one time, then 94oC for 30 seconds, 53oC for 40 seconds, 
95 72oC for 1 minutes and cycled 28 times. A 5 minute final elongation step at 72oC was performed 
96 following the final cycle. An Ion Torrent PGM was used for sequencing at according to the Page 5 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
697 manufacturer’s guidelines. Proprietary analysis pipeline software was used for processing the sequence 
98 data. Briefly, all barcodes and primers were removed from the sequences and any remaining sequence 
99 less than 150bp was removed from the sample. Additionally, any sequence with homopolymer runs 
100 more than 6pb were also removed prior to denoising the sample, generating OTU’s and removing 
101 chimeras. Operational taxonomically units (OTU’s) were determined by clustering at 97% similarity (3% 
102 divergence). BLASTn was used to taxonomically classify each OTU. Sequences were grouped 
103 taxonomically. Analysis of phylum, family, and genus were used for comparison of genomic diversity at 
104 each site. Data files were arranged by percent presence in each sample. 
105 Results
106 Sample collection
107 Sediment from areas of low flow were collected from each holding pond (Figure 1) 1-5 along with a 
108 sample from the wetlands area where the water courses before flowing into Chartiers Creek. Six 
109 samples were collected for this study.
110 rRNA Gene Sequencing
111 16s rRNA gene sequences were found through PGM sequencing. Sequences are deposited into NCBI 
112 with the SRA accession of PRJNA518724. Over 370,400 sequences were found and compared using 
113 Blastn at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Data was organized by phylum, 
114 class, family, genus and species. Table 1 indicates the number of genra and species found at each site 
115 along with the total number of reads from that site. The top 4 phyla at each site included 
116 Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes. The next 6 phyla varied, but each site 
117 had Acidobacteria, Spirochaetes and Chloroflexi represented. The remaining 3 phyla at each site was 
118 from one of the following groups: Tenericutes, Planctomycetes, Ignavicacteriae, Nitrospinae, or Page 6 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
7119 Cyanobacteria. Figure 2 illustrates the percent of organisms from these 12 groups and other. As noted in 
120 Figure 1, the majority of organisms belong to the phyla of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (52-75%).
121 Comparison of sequences at the genus taxonomic level included more than 850 members. Each location 
122 had between 528-655 genera represented. Among the samples, two were found in the top 3 groups of 
123 all five sites; Geobacter and Cytophaga. The top 20 organisms at each site were compared between sites 
124 (Table 2). Further analysis of the data examining organisms having more representation in either Pond 1 
125 or the Wetlands sample was noted in Table 3. These organisms were present at least 3 fold higher in one 
126 of the samples relative to the other.
127 Discussion
128 Many of the organisms identified through this study are common between samples. The most diverse 
129 sample was from pond 4 with 1022 species identified. The least diverse was pond 2 with 796 unique 
130 species. To better compare these samples, percent of each group was calculated and used for data 
131 analysis. Relative abundance of each varied and some of those detected in one site were not identified 
132 in other samples. Those found in one or a few sites are often among the lowest percent of organisms 
133 represented in their group. The two most abundant phyla represented in the sediment samples are 
134 Proteobaceria and Bacteroidetes (Figure 2). These two are among some of the most commonly 
135 represented phyla in previously reported mine drainage samples (Bruneel et.al. 2017, Chaput et al. 
136 2015). Five additional abundant phyla are among the remaining six in each sample: Acidobacteria, 
137 Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, and Chloroflexi. Beyond these phyla, the other three vary 
138 between the sites with some phyla appearing in up to four or five of the sites. 
139 From the Proteobacteria, the genera Anaeromyxobacter, Desulfobacterium, Desulfobulbus, and 
140 Pelobacter  are represented in the top 20 of 5 of the 6 sites (Table 2). Anaeromyxobacter is a facultative 
141 organohalide respiring bacteria and grow anaerobically (Sanford et al. 2002). Sanford et al reports that Page 7 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
8142 this genus of organisms may use nitrate, fumarate, and chlorophenolic molecules as terminal electron 
143 acceptors. Additional reports also identify that members of this genus are capable of reducing iron and 
144 uranium (He and Stanford 2003; Treude et al 2003; Wu et al. 2006; Sanford et al. 2012; Onley et al. 
145 2018) The sediment collected from the passive remediation ponds (1-5) was under 60-90cm of water in 
146 low flow areas (Buxton, 2018). As such, the microorganisms found here would have less oxygen present 
147 in the sediment. The Deltaproteobacteria  family includes the genera Desulfobacterium, Desulfobulbus, 
148 and Pelobacter. Species from the Desulfobacterium and Desulfobulbus are part of the sulfur cycle 
149 studied in aquatic sedimentation using various fermentation pathways (Pagani et al. 2011). The genus 
150 Pelobacter  consists of microorganisms which are strictly anaerobic (Schink, 2006). 
151 In the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genera Anaerophaga, Bacteroides, Cytophaga , and Solitalea were 
152 present in the top 20 of at least 5 of the 6 samples. Anaerophaga was first described in 2002 by Denger 
153 et al. as a new genus of strictly anaerobic microorganisms which are non-photosynthetic and chemo-
154 organotrophic. These organisms are rod shaped and in aging cultures produce an orange-red pigment 
155 similar to flexirubins. Bacteroides in general are nonendospore forming bacteria. These organisms have 
156 been identified in many MD samples (Delmont et al 2011; Llyod et al. 2004). Cytophaga are a group of 
157 rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria commonly found in soil. These organisms are known for their ability 
158 to rapidly digest cellulose (Stanier 1942; McBride et al. 2014). The genera listed here are only a small 
159 subset of those identified through this study. 
160 Comparison of the relative microbe representation between Pond 1 and the Wetlands (Table 3). Those 
161 genera more abundant in the first pond include Solitalea, Pedosphaera, Rhodocyclus, Alkaliflexus, 
162 Chintinophaga, and Rhodoferax (Table 3A). Of these, Solitalea is described as a nitrate reducing 
163 microorganism found in the soil, suitable in aerobic environments or facultative anaerobic (Weon et al 
164 2009). Pedosphaera  and Chitinophaga have been identified in multiple soil samples (Brewer et al 2016). 
165 While many of these genera have little published data. The wetlands area of the passive water Page 8 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
9166 treatment center has an expanded amount of flora and fauna. In this area, the fourth most abundant 
167 genus found is Ignavibacterium (Table 3B) had more than a 5 fold change in relative community percent 
168 between the less polluted wetlands and the first sedimentation pond (wetlands 2.51; pond 1 0.44-Table 
169 3B). This genus was identified in all samples, with ponds 1 and 2 having 34 and 30 other groups more 
170 abundant (data not shown). This organism was first identified from microbial mats from a hot spring, but 
171 has been successfully cultured in the lab (Iino et al. 2010). The genomic sequence of Ignavibacterium 
172 suggests it may utilize a variety of electron donors and can live both aerobically and anaerobically 
173 permitting it to grow in both low flow and wetland areas (Liu et al. 2012). Pelotomaculum had the 
174 largest fold change of 27 between the wetlands and pond 1. This genus has only a few reported species 
175 (Qui et al 2006; Imachi et al. 2007; Imachi et al. 2002). Reports state these organisms utilize organic 
176 compounds and cooperate with methanogens and oxidize propionate (Lueders et al. 2004; Gan et al 
177 2012; Ishii et al 2005; Kato et al. 2009). Additionally, some of the organisms we identified with our study 
178 correlate to those found by others examining CMD.
179 Environmental data was not collected as part of this study, but data was found online from prior studies 
180 conducted at this passive remediation site. The information presented on the webpage was interpreted 
181 by the authors in this discussion. In 2014, the pH of the different sites was found to increase from 6.5 at 
182 the source of the water flow to 8.3 in the wetlands (Kester 2019). The amount of dissolved oxygen has 
183 an upward trend as the water flows from the source to the wetlands during the years of 2011-2014. 
184 While there is no consistent increase from year to year, each year reported has the same pattern. This 
185 irregular pattern from one year to the next may, in part, be due to sampling at different temperatures as 
186 noted in 2013 and 2014 the temperature was less than -6oC (less than 20OF) and in years 2010, 2011, 
187 and 2012 the temperature was between 10-18oC. 
188 SummaryPage 9 of 25
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftRoth et al.
10189 Many of the genera identified in this study are anaerobic or facultative and commonly have alternate 
190 electron acceptors and fermentation pathways. This is beneficial for organisms subjected to harsh 
191 conditions of heavy metal sedimentation (iron oxide) precipitating out of CMD contaminated water. 
192 Microbial diversity varies at the genus level for organisms utilizing the available nutrients and lack of 
193 oxygen in the contaminated and remediated sediment. Future analysis of this site includes continued 
194 sampling and investigation into changes of the microbial community along with environmental and 
195 elemental analysis of the water and sediment.
