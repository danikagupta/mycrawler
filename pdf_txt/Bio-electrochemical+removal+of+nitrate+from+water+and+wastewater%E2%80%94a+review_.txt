This study is focused on the mechanism of nitrate removal from aqueous solutions by electrochemical
denitriﬁcation process (EDN) in an undivided electrolytic cell. The sacriﬁcial (Fe and Al) electrodes andInert (graphite (Gr)) electrode are employed for evaluation of operational parameters, namely currentdensity, electrolysis time and sodium chloride concentration. The experimental results reveal that nitrate-N removal efﬁciency of 92% for Al–Fe (anode-cathode) and 80% for Fe–Fe are achieved at a current densityof 25 mAcm
−2and 180 min electrolysis time in 100 ppm of NaCl when the initial nitrate-N concentration
is 100 ppm. However, during this process approximately 20 ppm of ammonia-N is also formed. Ammonia-N generated is signiﬁcantly lower compared to the amount of nitrate-N removal. It can be attributed tothe fact that nitrate ion can be removed by both electrocoagulation (EC) and electrochemical reduction(ER) processes simultaneously. Experiments using Al, Fe and Gr as cathodes as well as anodes indicatethat the contribution of EC increases when dissolving anodes are used. Further conﬁrmation of nitrate-Nremoval by EC pathway is obtained by quantitative estimation of nitrate present in the sludge. DuringEDN, pH of the solution also increases with ammonia generation.

1. Introduction
Groundwater is a major source of drinking water for rural com-
munities in India and other developing countries. Due to extensiveuse of nitrate fertilizer in agriculture, this valuable groundwateris being contaminated by nitrates. Elevated nitrate contaminationin groundwater can cause ‘methemoglobinemia’ in blood lead-ing to blue baby syndrome in children [1,2] . For these reason, a
maximum desirable limit for nitrate (NO
3−) is 50 ppm (10 ppm
equivalent nitrate-N) for adults, 15 ppm (3 ppm equivalent nitrate-N) for children and 0.5 ppm of ammonia was permitted by WorldHealth Organization (WHO) [3]. Extensive data collected by Cen-
tral Ground Water Board of India (CGWB) indicated the presenceof 100–800 ppm nitrate levels in many regions of India [4]. Simi-
larly nitrate contamination in groundwater and surface water has

gains more and more attention.
Among the various methods available for removal of nitrate,
the biological methods [5–7] introduce additional biological impu-
rities and degradation products into the water during treatment.Highly water soluble nitrates require large volumes of adsorbentsfor their removal [8], leading to the generation of solid waste.
Electro-dialysis (ED) [9], nano-ﬁltration (NF) and reverse osmosis
(RO) [10] also lead to concentrated nitrate rejects, which require
further treatment and disposal. Hence, there is considerable inter-est in electrochemical denitriﬁcation (EDN) processes, which canbe operated at a small scale to meet local community demand fordrinking water in villages.
The mechanistic studies of EDN exhibit certain unsettled
issuses. Electrochemical reduction (ER) and electrocoagulation (EC)processes are the two approaches being investigated for denitriﬁ-cation. Nitrite and ammonia are the main products formed duringER of nitrate ion [11,12] . Direct 5e

gas has been claimed in some reports, supported by the mechanismwhich deals with the formation of nitrogen gas during chemicalreduction of nitrate using Al and Fe powders [13–17] . The suitable

approach to understand the mechanism can be rendered as the
formation of ammonia from nitrate and nitrite at cathode and sub-sequent re-oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen on the catalytic anodesurfaces [18] as shown in Scheme 1 . Detailed studies on the mech-
anism of ammonia oxidation on RuO
2and IrO 2coated electrodes
[19–21] also support this mechanistic pathway. Residual ammonia-
N is found to be less in the ER process when oxide coated Ti wasused as the anode [13–15,22] . The complex mechanistic pathways
discussed in the literature for the EC mechanism are summarizedinScheme 1 .
Energy consumption for EC process is twenty times more than
ER process in the faradaic EDN [23] . Hence, more attention has
been given for EC pathways in EDN. Both Al and Fe anodes playa substantial role in nitrate removal by EC process. The EC pro-cess [23–26] was indeed shown to be more efﬁcient than chemical
coagulation using Al
3+or Fe3+salts [26] . However, there are con-
tradicting reports on the cathodic process during EC. It has beenreported that ammonia is generated only on Al electrodes duringinitial stages of EC. Direct cathodic reduction of nitrate to nitrogengas [25] and formation of hydrogen gas [24] has also been sug-
gested as the predominant cathodic process. EC and ER pathwayshave been proposed for nitrate removal in ﬂow reactors using mildsteel [27] and zero-valent iron [28] electrodes, respectively. Fur-
ther, basic studies are necessary for evaluating of the role of ERand EC pathways in EDN process. The main objective of the presentresearch work is to identify experimental conditions under whichthe 100 mg L
−1of nitrate-N can be removed from aqueous solution
containing 100 mg L−1NaCl by EDN process and also to elucidate
the respective role of ER and EC in nitrate removal.2. Materials and methods
2.1. Denitriﬁcation experiments
Electrochemical denitriﬁcation experiments were performed at
room temperature in an open undivided batch electrolysis cell(500 mL glass beaker) containing 300 mL electrolyte, as depictedinFig. 1 . Graphite (Gr), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) plates were
employed as electrode materials. Anode and cathode with an interelectrode distance of 2 cm were connected to a regulated DC powersupply (ApLab C3202). Synthetic nitrate contaminated water wasprepared using analytical grade potassium nitrate (KNO
3, 99%
Himedia, India) and sodium chloride (NaCl, 99% Merck ChemicalsIndia). The salts were dissolved in double distilled water. ElectrolytepH was found to be in the range of 7 ±0.1. The electrolyte was con-
tinuously stirred magnetically at a constant speed (300 rpm) duringelectrolysis and then allowed to settle for 2 h. The solution was ﬁl-tered through Whatmann ﬁlter paper and the ﬁltrate was used foranalysis. Triplicate runs were carried out for every experiment toensure reproducibility.
2.2. Data analysis
Nitrate-N (NO
3−-N) concentration in the solution before and
after EC was analyzed by UV spectrophotometer (JASCO V-650). 1N HCl was used for the acidiﬁcation of samples to prevent the inter-ference from hydroxide or carbonate anions. Chloride and sulfatehave no effect on the estimated value [29] . Ammonia-N (NH
4-N)
concentration in residual solution was estimated colorimetricallyby Nesslerization method [29] . All the experiments were performed
at 25 ±2
◦C. The sludge samples obtained after EDN process was
washed with distilled water and dried overnight at 40◦C. The scan-
ning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patternof the dried sludge was obtained using JEOL JSM-6390 and SHI-MADZU XPERT-PRO diffractometer, respectively.
For the estimation of nitrate-N content, the sludge (100 mg)
was dissolved in 3–5 mL of concentrated H
2SO 4to obtain a clear
solution. The solution was then made up to 100 mL. The nitrate-N

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of operational parameters
The results obtained during EDN of aqueous solution containing
100 ppm nitrate-N and 100 ppm NaCl in neutral pH are presentedinFig. 2 .F e( Fig. 2 a) and Al ( Fig. 2 b) electrodes are used as anodes
with common Gr cathode. The electrolysis time is kept constant at60 min. The concentration of residual nitrate-N, ammonia-N andﬁnal pH of the solution obtained at different current densities arecompared. These results illustrate that increment of current densityhas a substantial effect on reducing the concentration of nitrate-N.The nitrate-N removal is also accompanied by ammonia genera-tion which increases with increasing current density. The effect iscommon for both the electrode pairs. Efﬁcient nitrate-N removal isachieved when Al is employed as the anode.

−2). Error bars
are the standard deviations of triplicate experiments.
On Al anode, the residual nitrate-N concentration reaches the
permissible limit ( Fig. 3 b) in 180 min. The residual nitrate-N con-
centration in the case of Fe anode is found to be around 20 ppmunder identical conditions. The pH values are found to increase withelectrolysis time ( Fig. 3 ).
The experimental results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 reveals that
maximum ammonia-N formed at different current densities andelectrolysis times is around 10–20 ppm. The ammonia generation isexpected to come from ER of nitrate ion by an overall 8e
−reduction
as represented by the following reaction:
NO 3−+8e−+6H 2O→ NH 3+9OH−(1)
By considering 100% of electrochemical reduction (8e−reduc-
tion) in cathodic region can generate around 23.3 ppm ofammonia-N in 180 min of electrolysis time and with the currentdensity of 25 mA cm
−2on 14.3 cm2electrode surfaces.But the mea-
sured value of ammonia-N concentration is always found to belesser than 23.3 ppm ( Fig. 3 a and b). Hydrogen evolution as a com-
petitive cathodic reaction [24] can lead to lower efﬁciencies for
ammonia generation. Since both the cathodic processes (Eqs. (1)K. Govindan et al. / Journal of Water Process Engineering 6 (2015) 58–63 61
and (2)) lead to the formation of hydroxide ions, the pH of the
solution increases during electrolysis.
2H 2O+2e−→ H2+2OH−(2)
The results presented in Fig. 3 also elucidate that generation
of ammonia-N may reach 15 ppm in the ﬁrst one hour of elec-trolysis. As per the faradaic process should produce only 7.8 ppmof ammonia-N in one hour. Thus it appears that there is also anon-faradaic contribution toward ammonia production, especiallyduring the early stages of EDN. This may be due to the contribu-tion of direct chemical reduction of nitrate by Al or Fe powderformed during anodic dissolution (Eq. (3)). Such chemical reduc-
tion of nitrate by Al [14] and Fe [17] powder is well established.
For Al powder, the overall nitrate reduction is represented by thefollowing equation.
8Al+3NO
3−+18H 2O→ 8Al3++3NH 3+27OH−(3)
The total nitrate-N removal efﬁciency is always much higher
than the ammonia generation ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ). This result suggests
that ER is not the only mode of EDN. But EC processes also leadsnitrate removal, because nitrate ions preferentially adsorbs on sur-face of growing aluminum hydroxide (Eq. (5)) and iron hydroxide
(Eq. (7)) sludges [26,30] .

These experimental results conﬁrm that the formation of
ammonia during electrolysis, which is further stabilized by the ﬁnalpH of 10–11. The residual solution obtained under experimentalconditions described in Fig. 3 b is found to be quite stable at room
temperature.
Some reports suggested that the oxidation of ammonia by the
electrochemically generated chlorine gas or hypochlorite (OCl
−)a t
the anode surface. The present studies indicate that the nitrate-Nremoval and ammonia production are quite independent of NaClconcentration ( Fig. 4 ). The chloride (Cl
−) concentration does not
have an effect on the EDN process and hence OCl−generation does
not contribute toward this process.
3.2. Effect of electrode materials
The role of EC and ER pathways is further investigated by study-
ing the effect of electrode pairs on nitrate-N removal and ammoniageneration. In addition to that the dissolving Al and Fe anodes, Grelectrode is chosen as an inert anode material. All the three elec-trodes are also employed as cathodes. The electrolysis is carriedout at a current density of 25 mA cm
−2for 60 min in these exper-
iments. The residual nitrate-N as well as generated ammonia-Nvalues obtained for all the nine different electrode pairs are pre-sented in Fig. 5 .
These results indicate that the residual nitrate-N in solution after
EDN is much higher when the non-dissolving Gr is used as the anodematerial. This further conﬁrms that the additional contribution ofnitrate-N removal by dissolving anodes through EC process. Amongthe dissolving anodes, Al leads to better nitrate-N removal efﬁ-ciency when compared to Fe anode. These results also conﬁrm thatammonia is invariably generated by ER in all the nine experimentsinvolving Al, Fe and Gr electrodes. In the case of Gr–Gr electrodepair, the decline in the nitrate-N concentration (13.8%) is quite close024681012

to the ammonia-N generated (12.5%). It can be inferred that removal
of nitrate-N occurs solely due to the ER pathway alone in the caseof the Gr-Gr electrode pair.
3.3. Sludge characterization
The Fe and Al sludges generated during the EDN are found
to retain individual characteristics of their respective hydroxides.The SEM images of the sludges produced by Fe and Al anodes arerepresented in Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. Hydroxide sludges gen-
erated by Fe anode contain much smaller particles ( Fig. 6 a) when
compared to the larger agglomers found in aluminum hydroxidesludges ( Fig. 6 b) produced by Al anode under identical conditions.
The XRD data presented in Fig. 7 a exhibits the crystalline nature
of the sludge generated by EDN with Fe anode and Gr cathode.It conﬁrms that the formation of crystalline iron oxide hydroxide(Fe

erated by Al anode and Gr cathode is illustrated in Fig. 7b. Strong

are identiﬁed in the XRD patterns.
However, the presence of nitrate-N in sludges generated from
electrochemical process is also analyzed by dissolving the sludgesin concentrated H
2SO 4. Typical nitrate-N concentration values
obtained from the dissolved sludge from Fe–Gr and Al–Gr elec-trode pairs are presented in Table 1 . As indicated in Table 1 , the
nitrate-N removal efﬁciency around 58% is achieved for Fe–Gr elec-trode. Whereas, around 20% of the nitrate-N reduction due to theammonia-N generation through electroreduction of nitrate ion. Aswell as the presence of 31% of nitrate-N in the sludge indicatethat nitrate ion can also eliminated by electrochemical coagulation.Likewise, the nitrate-N removal efﬁciency around 89% is obtainedfor Al–Gr electrode. In which, 21% of nitrate-N reduction due to theammonia-N generation through electroreduction of nitrate ion andthe presence of 66% of nitrate-N in the sludge indicate that nitrateion can also eliminated by electrochemical coagulation. Therefore,the above experimental observation substantiate that the nitrate

4. Conclusions
The present investigation establishes the possibility of reducing
the nitrate-N concentration to permissible limits by electrochem-ical denitriﬁcation (EDN). The experimental results reveal thatmaximum nitrate-N removal efﬁciency of 92% for Al–Fe (anode-cathode) and 80% for Fe–Fe are achieved at a current density of25 mAcm
−2and 180 min electrolysis time in 100 ppm of NaCl when
the initial nitrate-N concentration is 100 ppm. However, ER invari-ably occurs along with EC on all the cathode materials, leading tothe formation of ammonia. Adsorption of nitrate ion onto surfaceof growing metal hydroxide precipitates appears to be the primarymechanism behind the observed large nitrate removal efﬁciency.
The dissolving anodes (Fe and Al) also contribute to the nitrate-N
removal by EC route. Al anode is more efﬁcient in nitrate-N removalwhen compared to Fe anode. Under all experimental conditionsemployed in the present study, generation of around 20% ammoniawas observed. The solution pH was also found to increase invariablyduring this process. The production of ammonia was found to bequite stable in the alkaline solution formed during EDN. The over-all results indicate that electrochemical denitriﬁcation processesis an effective technologies for nitrate removal from water. How-ever, alternative method air stripping facilities would be neededto remove the electrochemically generated ammonium ions fromsolution.
