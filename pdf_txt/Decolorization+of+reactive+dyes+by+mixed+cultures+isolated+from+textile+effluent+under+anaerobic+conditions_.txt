ABSTRACT:   
 
The dye decolorizing  isolates, Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp. Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were 
isolated from the textile effluent samples collected from Elampillai, Tamil Nadu. Different paramete rs such 
as various carbon source, nitrogen source, temperature, pH and inocu lum size were optimized for 
decolorization of Orange 3R by using bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas  sp. and Bacillus  sp. showed 
maximum dye decolorization of 89% at the end of 144h under optimum condition. But the Bacillus  sp. was 
found to be more efficient i n dye decolorization. All parameters studied in this paper were found to be 
effective for all isolates. The results reported here warrant further investigation to establish the  usefulness 
of these isolates for bioremediation and biodegradation application such as waste water treatment. High 
decolorization extent and facile conditions show the potential for this bacterial strain to be used in the 
biological treatment of dyeing mill effluents.

[I] INTRODUCTION   
 
Water is life but now a -days due to the 
advancement in industrialization, it is spoiling a 
lot. Many contaminants present in wastewater, 
such as acids, bases, toxic organic and inorganic 
dissolved solids, and colors. Among them, 
colors are considered the most undesirable and 
are mainly caused by dyes [1]. Dyes usually 
have a synthetic origin and complex aromatic 
molecular structures which make them more 
stable and more difficult to biodegrade [2]. The 
textile industry utilizes about 1 0000 different 
dyes and pigments. The worldwide annual 
production of dyes is over 7·105 tons [3,4]. The 
dyestuff usage has been increased day by day 
because of tremendous increase of 
industrialization and man’s urge for color [5]. 
Synthetic dyestuffs are u sed extensively in 
textile, paper, printing industries and dyehouses. 
The effluents of these industries are highly 
colored and the disposal of these wastes into   
 
 
receiving waters causes damage to the 
environment. Dyes may significantly affect 
photosynth etic activity in aquatic life because of 
reduced light penetration and may also be toxic 
to some aquatic life due to the presence of 
aromatics and metals, chlorides, etc. Dyes 
tinctorial value is high: less than 1 ppm of the 
dye produces obvious coloration  [6].  
 
Removal of color from dye bearing wastewater 
is a complex problem because of difficulty in 
treating such wastewaters by conventional 
treatment methods [7]. Ozonation, 
photooxidation, electrocoagulation, adsorption, 
activated carbon, froth flotation , reverse 
osmosis, ion exchange, membrane filtration and 
flocculation, are applied for color removal from 
textile effluents [8 -10]. These physic -chemical 
methods are less efficient, costly, of limited 
applicability and produce wastes, which are BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R

 difficult t o dispose off. In some cases, traditional 
biological procedures were combined with 
chemical or physical treatment processes to 
achieve better decolorization. As a viable 
alternative, biological processes have received 
increasing interestowing to their cost , 
effectiveness, ability to produce loss sludge and 
environmental benignity [11]. Biological 
processes have potential to convert or degrade 
the pollutant into water, carbon dioxide and 
various salts of inorganic nature. The isolation 
of potent species and there by degradation is one 
of the interest in biological aspect of effluents 
treatment [5].  
 
In recent years a number of studies have focused 
on some microorganisms that are able to degrade 
and absorb dyes from wastewater. A wide 
variety of microorganism s are capable of 
decolorization of a wide range of dyes some of 
them are as bacteria: Escherichia coli  NO3 
[[12], Pseudomonas luteola  [13], Aeromonas 
hydrophila  [11]; fungi: Aspergillus niger  [14], 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Aspergillus 
terricola  [15], P. chrysosporium  [16]; yeasts: 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Candida tropicalis, 
C. lipolytica [17]; algae: Spirogyra  species [18], 
Chlorella vulgaris [19], C. sorokiniana [20], 
Lemna minuscula  [21], Scenedesmus obliquus, 
C. pyrenoidosa and Closterium lunula  [22]. 
Malachite Green (MG) is a triphenyl methane 
dye, which is most widely used for coloring 
purpose, amongst all other dyes of its category 
[23]. MG has properties that make it difficult to 
remove from aqueous solutions. If the solution 
containing MG disch arged into receiving 
streams it will affect the aquatic life and cause 
detrimental effects in liver, gill, kidney, intestine 
and gonads. In humans, it may cause irritation to 
the gastrointestinal tract upon ingestion. Contact 
of MG with skin causes irritat ion and redness 
and pain. Upon contact with eye will lead to 
permanent injury of human eyes and laboratory 
animals [24].   
This study aims to investigate the potential of 
bacterial cultures for decolorization effluent 
containing a textile dye, Orange 3R dye  
decolorization by bacterial cultures with respect 
to various nutritional sources (carbon and 
nitrogen), environmental parameters 
(temperature, pH, inoculum size) was optimized.  
 
[II] MATERIALS AND M ETHODS   
 
2.1. Chemicals and media  
Textile dye, Orange 3R (Figure 1) and dye 
effluents were collected from a dying industry 
located at Elampillai, Salem (TN). All 
microbiological media and medium ingredients 
were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories 
(Mumbai, MH, India).

2.2. Isolation, screening and identification of 
dye degrading bacteria  
The dye decolorizing bacteria were isolated 
from textile dye effluent by serial dilution and 
plating appropriate dilutions on modified Zhou 
and Zimmermann  (ZZ) agar medium containing 
(g/L), 5 -yeast extract, 5 -glucose, 0.5 -(NH 4)2 
SO 4, 2.66 -KH 2HPO 4, 4.32-Na2HPO 4, 100 mg -
Dye (Orange 3R), 20 -agar (pH 7.0). All the 
isolated cultures were studies by inoculating 
them in effluent basal medium containing (g/L 
of dye  containing effluent), 5 -yeast extract, 5 -
glucose, 0.5 -(NH 4)2 SO 4, 2.66 -KH 2HPO 4, 4.32-
Na2HPO 4 (pH 7.0).The inoculated medium was 
incubated at 30oC for six days under shaking BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R

 culture conditions After seven days 
decolorization effect was seen visually. The 
isolates showing more decolorization of the 
Orange 3R were selected for further studies. Dye 
degrading isolates were identified on the basis of 
morphological and biochemical tests according 
to Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology 
[25].  
 
2.3. Dye decol orization evaluation  
The dye decolorizing bacteria were screened 
using modified method of Arun Prasad and 
Bhaskara Rao [26]. Decolorization activity was 
performed in 100 ml of ZZ medium containing 
0.02g of Orange 3R and 10% (v/v) inoculum of 
each isolate u sed separately. Uninoculated dye 
medium served as control. Inoculated medium 
and control was incubated at 30o C for six days 
under shake culture condition. About 2 ml 
samples were withdrawn aseptically and 
centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The 
clear  supernatant was used for measuring 
absorption at 600 nm using UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The 
percent decolorization of effluent was 
determined by using the formula:  
 
D= [A 0-A1)/A 0] x 100  
where, D, decolorization  in % ; A 0, initial 
absorban ce; A 1, final absorbance  
 
2.4. Dye decolorization optimization  
Decolorization of orange 3R textile dye by all 
four isolates was optimized with respect to the 
effect of 1%, carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, 
mannitol), 0.25%, nitrogen sources (beef extract, 
peptone, yeast extract), temperature (4, 27, 
370C), pH (5 -9), and inoculum (2 -10%).  Initial 
experiments were carried out with 10%, (v/v) 
inoculum of each selected isolate in ZZ medium 
and ZZ medium without culture was served as 
control. All the flasks wer e incubated at 30oC 
under shaking conditions (150 rpm) for six days. After six  days the samples were withdrawn and 
analysed for percent decolorization.  
 
2.5. Time course of dye decolorization  
The time course of decolorization was carried 
out under optimum  conditions obtained from 
above studies and the optimum conditions are: 
for Bacillus  sp. (1% sucrose, 1% peptone, pH 8, 
270C and 4% inoculum), for Kleibsiella  sp. (1% 
sucrose, 1% beef  extract, pH 7, 270C and 6% 
inoculum), for Salmonella  sp. (1% sucrose, 1 % 
beef extract, pH 8, 370C and 10% inoculum) and 
for Pseudomonas  sp. (1% sucrose, 1% beef 
extract, pH 6, 40C and 10% inoculum). Flasks 
were incubated up to 144h at their respective 
temperature and samples were removed after 
every 24 h and analyzed for deco lorization 
activity as described above.  
 
2.6. Statistical Analysis  
All analysis was conducted in triplicate and 
results presented here are the mean of triplicate 
± standard deviations (SD)  
  
[III] RESULTS ANS DISCUSSION  
 
3.1. Isolation, screening and iden tification of 
dye degrading bacteria  
The sample was collected from textile dye 
industry Elampillai, Salem District Tamilnadu. 
Textile industries have shown as increase in 
installed spindle age, yarn production and output 
of fabric and garments. It is very clear that these 
industries play a positive role in the Indian 
economical reformation [27].  Textile dye 
effluent sample were collected from the disposal 
site of effluent for screening and isolation of dye 
degrading bacteria . Since chances of getting 
microb es having the ability to decolorize the dye 
effluent is very high. The textile and dyeing 
industry are one of the industries, which 
contribute to the soil and water pollution. There 
are about 700 dyeing and bleaching units located 
in and around Tiruppur an d Coimbatore in Tamil BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R

 Nadu state. The consume substantial volumes of 
water and chemicals such as bleaching liquids, 
soda ash, caustic soda, sul furic acid and sodium 
peroxide [28]. Large amount of dye containing 
effluents are discharged into water bodies by  
these industries carrying pollution problem. This 
pollution problem is a topic of great public and 
government concern today, forced by legislation. 
The industrial units are now looking forward to cost effective solutions for reduction of pollution 
loads t o meet the regulatory requirements.  
 
The bacterial cultures were identified by

3.2. Dye decolorization optimization  
Three carbons sources such as glucose, sucrose 
and mannitol were used (Fig . 2). The range of 
activity on decolorization of orange 3R with 
glucose was 81.83% 56.83% 83.33%and 75.76% 
with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., Salmonella  sp., 
and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. An 
organism, Salmonella  sp. was found to be the 
most effective decolorizer. The range of activity 
on decolorization of orange 3R with sucrose was 
87.80%, 72.36%, 86.18% and 80.49% with  
Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., Salmonella  sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively.  Bacterium 
Bacillus sp. was fo und to be the most effective 
decolorizer. The range of activity on 
decolorization of orange 3R with mannitol was 
87.09%, 64.04%, 86.84% and 73.68%, with 
Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., Salmonella  sp. and 
Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella  sp., 
respectively. Also  Salmonella  sp. was found to 
be the most effective decolorizer. Wang et al. 
[29] reported a Citrobacter  sp. decolorized by 
96.2% of reactive red 180 dye with 4g/L of 
glucose as carbon source.  BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R

Three nitrogen sources such as beef extract, 
peptone and yeast extract were us ed (Fig .3). The 
range of activity on decolorization of orange 3R 
with beef extract was 84.67%, 67.33%, 70.67%, 
87.33% with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., 
Salmonella  sp., and Pseudomonas sp., 
respectively. Pseudomonas sp. was found to be 
the most effective d ecolorizer. The range of 
activity on decolorization of orange 3R with 
peptone was 85.29%, 64.71%, 42.16% and 
78.43% with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., 
Salmonella  sp. and Pseudomonas sp., 
respectively.  Bacillus sp. was found to be the 
most effective decolo rizer.  The range of activity 
on decolorization of orange 3R with yeast 
extract was 82.81%, 70.17%, 53.91% and 
81.25%% with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., 
Salmonella  sp., and Pseudomonas sp, 
respectively. A bacterium Bacillus sp. was found 
to be the most eff ective decolorizer. Mathew and 
Madamwar [30] reported use of 0.1% yeast 
extract for decolorization of ranocid fast blue 
dye but it was for bacterial consortium.  
 Three different temperatures such as 4, 27 and 
37OC were used (Fig . 4). The range of activity 
on decolorization of orange 3R with 4OC was 
78.57%, 46.83%, 41.27% and 73.81% with 
Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., Salmonella  sp. and 
Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Bacillus sp. was 
found to be the most effective decolorizer. The 
range of activity on decolor ization of orange 3R 
with 27OC was 79.36%, 52.38%, 42.06% and 
73.02% with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., 
Salmonella  sp. and Pseudomonas sp., 
respectively. A bacterium Bacillus sp. was found 
to be the most effective decolorizer.  The range 
of activity on deco lorization of orange 3R with 
37OC was 78.57%, 44.44%, 48.41%, 72.22% 
with Bacillus sp., Klebsiella  sp., Salmonella  sp. 
and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Bacillus sp. 
was found to be the most effective decolorizer. 
Overall decolorization efficiency was not  
temperature dependent but a report showed a 
suppressed decolourizing activity at 45oC, this 
might be due to the loss of cell viability or 
deactivation of the enzymes responsible for 
decolourization at higher temperature [31].BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R

Pseudomonas sp. shows the highest 
decolorization (89.06% and 86.72%) at pH 6 and 
pH 8.  Bacillus sp. shows the highest 
decolorization of 86.72% at pH 7 while, 
Klebsiella  sp. showed the highest decolorization 
at pH 9 (Fig . 5). The optimum pH was found to 
be between pH 6 to 8 for maximum removal of 
dye. The pH has a major effect on the efficienc y 
of dye decolorization, and the optimal pH for 
color removal is often between 6.0 and 10.0 for 
most of the dyes [32]. The pH tolerance of 
decolourizing bacteria is quite important because 
reactive azo dyes bind to cotton fibers by 
addition or substitution  mechanisms under 
alkaline conditions and at high temperatures 
[33]. 
 
The 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% of inoculums are 
used for the four isolates to degrade the textile 
dye effluent (Fig . 6). Decolorization activity of  
Bacillus  sp. has high (86.72%) in 4% of 
inoculums. Decolorization activity of  Klebsiella  
sp. has high (67.19%) in 6% of inoculums. 
Decolorization activity of  Salmonella  sp. has 
high (53.91%) in 6% of inoculums. Pseudomonas  sp. have highly decolorize (50%) 
with 10% of inoculums. Kumar et al. [34] u sed a 
mixed culture for decolorization of reactive azo -
dye and reported 98% decolorization at 10% 
inoculum size.  
 
3.3. Time course of dye decolorization  
The present study report the high decolorization 
of textile dye effluent by bacteria with 
optimization of conditions. Specific conditions 
used for maximum decolorization effect (Fig . 7). 
Bacillus  sp. and Pseudomonas  sp. were 
produced similar level (89%) of decolorization 
of Orange 3R at 144h followed by 80 and 76% 
by Salmonella  sp. and Klebsiella  sp., 
respe ctively. In literature Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa  decolorized Orange 3R dye by 
93.06% [35]. Jothimani and Prabhakaran [36] 
has reported 59% dye removal from a dyeing 
industry effluent using pseudomonas after 4 
days of inoculation and with Bacillus sp. 
Differen t dyes may be used, this attributed to 
differences in dye structures as has also been 
reported earlier for other microbial cultures [37].

[V] CONCLUSION  
The textile dye (Orange 3R) is degradable under 
aerobic conditions with a concerted effort of 
bacteria isolated from textile dye effluent. 
Nutrients (carbon and nitrogen  
 source s) and physical parameters (pH, 
temperature and inoculum size) had significant 
effect on dye decolorization. Pseudomonas sp. 
showed highest decolorization of  Orange 3R 
dye effectively during optimization and more 
interesting Pseudomonas sp. showed consist ent BACTERIAL DECOLORIZA TION OF TEXTILE DYE - ORANGE 3R
