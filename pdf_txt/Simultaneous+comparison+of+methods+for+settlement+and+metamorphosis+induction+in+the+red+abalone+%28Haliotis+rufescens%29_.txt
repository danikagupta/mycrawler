ABSTRACT Settlement of Haliotis tuberculata coccinea larvae was examined in the presence of crustose coralline algae (CCA),
Ulvella lens, andUlva rigida . Germlings of the 2 green macroalgae of different age, enrichment level, and in combination were tested
as settlement cues, and CCA was tested as a positive control. Larval settlement was the highest on CCA (61%) tailed by a 45-day-oldmix of U. lens andU. rigida (52%) and 45-day-old U. rigida (46%). Settlement was the lowest (about 3%) on a mix of 4-day-old U.
lensandU. rigida and 45-day-old enriched or unenriched U. lens. In all treatments, postlarvae were fed for 4 wk with a mix of diatoms
(Amphora sp.,Proschkinia sp.,Nitzschia sp., and Navicula incerta ); postlarval growth was the best on the 45-day-old mix of U. lens
andU. rigida. This substrate was also the best of the green macroalgae germlings substrates tested for settlement induction and
provided good survival rates. The substrate protein content correlated negatively with larval settlement and survival. The algal cues
were differentiated by their fatty acid composition. Fatty acids such as 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6, 16:4n-3, arachidonic acid, and
eicosapentaenoic acid were suggested to affect settlement and survival. The fatty acids correlated with settlement were differentfrom the ones associated with survival rates, except eicosapentaenoic acid, which correlated with both. The results of this study show
the high value of U. rigida forH. tuberculata postlarvae, and the inﬂuence of substrate age on the settlement success.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge relevant to settlement cues is critical for abalone
breeding (Roberts 2001), because adequacy of the selected cues
directly determine settlement rates directly and early postlarval
survival (Searcy-Bernal et al. 1992, Slattery 1992, Daume et al.1999, Roberts 2001, Takami et al. 2002). Cues from a wide
range of sources are reported to induce settlement of Haliotis
larvae, including crustose coralline algae (CCA) (Morse et al.1980, Morse & Morse 1984, Moss & Tong 1992, Takami et al.
1997, Daume et al. 1999, Daume et al. 2000, Roberts et al. 2004,
Williams et al. 2008), ﬁlms of benthic diatoms (Seki & Kan-No1981, Kawamura & Kikuchi 1992, Daume et al. 1999, Roberts
et al. 2007), abalone mucus trails (Searcy-Bernal et al. 1992,
Slattery 1992, Seki & Taniguchi 1996, Seki 1997, Bryan & Qian1998, Laimek et al. 2008 ), bacterial ﬁlms (Bryan & Qian 1998,Roberts 2001), or several puriﬁed chemicals like g-amino butyric
acid (Morse et al. 1980, Morse & Morse 1984, Morse 1985,
Trapido-Rosenthal & Morse 1986, Searcy-Bernal et al. 1992,Bryan & Qian 1998, Stewart et al. 2008).
Despite the established use of benthic bioﬁlms, consisting
of bacteria and mixed diatom species, in abalone hatcheriesworldwide (Daume 2006), larval settlement rates on such sub-
strates can be very low (1–10% of larvae) (Daume et al. 2000,
Courtois de Vic xose et al. 2010). Alternatively, the germlings of
the green alga Ulvella lens have been tested and used success-
fully to induce abalone settlement (Takahashi & Koganezawa
1988, Daume et al. 2000, Daume & Ryan 2004, Daume et al.
2004). Because each abalone species responds differently tosettlement cues (Daume et al. 1999), in previous studies a range
of cues were tested for Haliotis tuberculata coccinea and showed
thatU. lens induced higher settlement rates than diatom bioﬁlms(Courtois de Vic xose et al. 2010). Daume (2006) raised the hy-
pothesis that age and biochemical characteristics of U. lens
inﬂuences abalone larval se ttlement based on the clearer
preference of Haliotis rubra and Haliotis laevigata larvae for
older, rather than for younger, U. lens . However, this hypoth-
esis has not been tested on other abalone species.
The potential of various macroalgae to affect settlement of
invertebrate larvae has been tested and indicates that settling
and metamorphosing larvae are highly inﬂuenced by chemical,
biological, and physical cues—characteristics of each algae(Walters et al. 2003). Invertebrate larvae were shown to respond
to surface-associated or waterborne cues from macroalgae
(Pawlik 1992) and recruit speciﬁcally in response to compounds
produced by different algal species (Krug & Manzi 1999,
Williamson et al. 2000), and were reported to vary among thedifferent species (Hay 1996, Karsten et al. 1999). Planktonic
larvae of sea urchins have also been reported to settle and meta-
morphose in response to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)(Kitamura et al. 1993) and dibromomethane (Taniguchi et al.
1994).
Green macroalgae, other than Ulvella lens, have also been
studied for their potential for abalone settlement induction and
postlarval nutrition, but have yet to be investigated thoroughly
as a source of potential settlement cues, taking into accounttheir prevalence in the adult and postlarval habitat. For in-
stance, Seki (1997) reported that the foliose green algae Ulva sp.
induced metamorphosis of Haliotis discus hannai, and Strain
et al. (2006) suggested that germlings of Ulva sp. could provide a
suitable food source for abalone juveniles based on their nu-tritional and structural properties. Besides, the settlement in-
duction of Haliotis rubra larvae by the green algae Ulva australis
andUlva compressa was related primarily to the alga and linked
to chemical compounds produced by the algae or their surface
texture and topography (Huggett et al. 2005). However, to the

1189best of our knowledge, the use of germlings of Ulva spp. or
macroalgae other than U. lens as abalone settlement inducers
has not been investigated until now.
To improve the efﬁciency of Haliotis tuberculata breeding
techniques and production, and, more speciﬁcally, of Haliotis
tuberculata coccinea, further research was needed to improve
settlement induction as well as postlarval growth and survival.
The current study tests the germlings of Ulva rigida as settle-
ment inducers of H. tuberculata coccinea and investigates the
effects of age in addition to proximate biochemical and fatty
acid composition of Ulvella lens andU. rigida germlings, and
CCA, on larval settlement, and postlarval survival and growth
ofH. tuberculata coccinea .
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Larval Rearing
Captive Haliotis tuberculata coccinea broodstock were kept
in 60-L tanks placed in a ﬂow-through system at the InstitutoCanario de Ciencias Marinas (Canary Islands, Spain). Ripe
H. tuberculata coccinea were induced to spawn (male-to-female
ratio, 1:2) by UV-irradiated seawater (Kikuchi & Uki 1974),and larvae were obtained from gametes of 8 males and 14
females. Larvae from 1 mixed batch were used to conduct the
study and were estimated competent for settlement when thethird tubule of the cephalic tentacle could be observed (Hahn1989, Courtois de Vicose et al. 2007).
Algal Cultures
Four and 45-day-old Ulvella lens andUlva rigida germlings
were obtained from mature, spore-producing U. lens andU. rigida
thalli. The germlings of U. lens andU. rigida were obtained
according to previously described production methods, andtheir cultures were adapted (Daume et al. 2004, Strain et al.
2006). The cultures of old germlings (45 days old) from U. lens ,
U. rigida, and a mix of both were maintained aerated under a
natural photoperiod during the 45 days and the f/2 culturemedium was renewed weekly. As opposed to the old U. lens
germlings, enriched, 45-day-old U. lens germlings were enriched
at twice the f/2 concentration during the entire culture period.Germlings grown for 4 days and 45 days presented different
developmental stages on plates and reached diameters ranging
from 10–75 mm 75–300 mm, respectively. In addition, 45-day-old
germlings showed developed sporangia. In the CCA treatment,
settlement plates remained in nursery tanks to be colonized by
CCA until reaching 46.67 ±7.88% coverage.
Four species of diatoms— Navicula incerta ,Proschkinia sp.,
Nitzschia sp., and Amphora sp.—were provided as diets to the
postlarvae. All diatoms were cultured in 40-L horizontally laidalgal bags at initial inoculums of 10
5cells/mL and were grown for
5 days in f/2 medium supplemented with 1 mg/L silicate (Guillard,
1975) at ambient temperature and under continuous light of
62±8mmol photon/m2/sec. Photon ﬂux density (irradiance) was
measured using a digital light meter (HT170N, HT ITALIA,
Italy). The cultures were not axenic. Diatom cell concentration
was evaluated weekly with a Neubauer hemocytometer. Priorto the counts, ultrasound (1 min or 3 min) was applied to the
diatoms samples to avoid possible cell aggregations. Equal cell
numbers of each diatom were combined to obtain the 200-mLdiatom mixture fed weekly to the postlarvae.Estimates of Algal Cover
Ten randomly chosen ﬁelds of view on the settlement plates,
for each treatment, were photographed at a magniﬁcation of
4003at the time of larval settlement. Percent coverage of CCA,
Ulvella lens, andUlva rigida were then calculated by processing
the images with Image J Software (Image J 1.42q; National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Larval Settlement Experimental Protocol
The settlement study aimed at evaluating the effect of
different algal types and of di fferent age and biochemical
composition on the settlement rate of Haliotis tuberculata
coccinea . Eight treatments were tested: young (4 days old) and
old (45 days old) Ulvella lens , enriched old U. lens (45 days old),
young (4 days old) and old (45 days old) Ulva rigida, a combi-
nation of U. lens andU. rigida , both young and old, and, last,
CCA as the control treatment. Each treatment settlement plate
(50-cm2plastic squares) was colonized by the respective sub-
strate. Each type of substrate was tested in triplicate and eachreplicate consisted of 4 settlement plates placed vertically in
12-L containers ( n¼12/treatment). Larvae were introduced in
the containers at a density of 200 larvae/12-L container, rep-resenting 1 larvae/cm
2of substrate, their number being esti-
mated by counting them in 3 3-mL subsamples drawn from the
entire larval batch.
Twelve-liter containers were ﬁlled with 1- mm ﬁltered seawa-
ter supplied with low aeration. Water was renewed at a rate of
1%/h, 24 h after the introduction of larvae, and was ﬁnally
increased up to a 20% exchange per hour after 72 h.
Outlets were ﬁtted with 125- mm mesh screens to prevent the
loss of larvae. Seawater temperature in the rearing containers
was 21 ±0.5/C176C. An artiﬁcial photoperiod (12 h light/12 h dark)
was provided at a light intensity of 2,000 Lux and measured
using a digital light meter (HT170N, HT ITALIA).
Larvae attached permanently to the substrate after complete
metamorphosis (loss of the velum) were considered as settled
larvae and were counted on every plate of each replicate ( n¼12/
treatment) under a dissecting microscope 48 h after larvaeintroduction to the containers. Plates were kept immersed inseawater during microscopic observation and were replaced
immediately thereafter.
Postlarval Growth and Survival
Three days after the introduction of the larvae, and after
larvae completed their metamorphosis, a mixture of 4 different
diatoms ( Navicula incerta ,Proschkinia sp.,Nitzschia sp., and
Amphora sp.) were added as food to the 12-L containers.
Postlarvae were subsequently fed weekly with 200-mL inocu-
lums of the diatom mixture (106cells/mL). Postlarvae growth
and survival were monitored for 4 wk after settlement. Thenumber of live postlarvae was counted on every settlement plate
of each replicate ( n¼12/treatment) under a dissecting micro-
scope at weekly intervals. The shell length of 10 randomlyselected postlarvae per replicate was measured weekly with
a proﬁle and measuring projector (model PJ-H3000; Mitutoyo,
Japan). Plates were kept immersed at all times and were re-placed immediately after observation and measurement.
Daily growth rate (DGR) was calculated according to the
formula:COURTOIS DE VICxOSE ET AL . 1190Lf/C0Li
t
where Lfis the ﬁnal shell length measured in micrometers, Li
is the initial shell length measured in micrometers, and tis time
measured in days.
Analytical Methods
Triplicate samples of algae from each treatment were
collected by scraping the surface of settlement plates at thestart of the settlement experiment. The settlement plates used
for the biochemical analysis of the substrates were colonized
and cultured in the same conditions as the ones used for thestudy of larval settlement rate. The samples were cleaned,
washed with freshwater to remove salts, and stored at –80 /C176C
prior to analysis for total lipid s, protein, carbohydrate, ash,
and total fatty acids. Before analysis, all samples where ho-
mogenized with mortar and pestle before being weighed for
further analysis. Dry matter was calculated from weight lossafter drying for 24 h at 105 /C176C. Total protein was calculated
from total Kjeldahl nitrogen according to AOAC (2005) stan-
dard methods. Ash content was determined gravimetrically
after incinerating the samples at 600 /C176C during 24 h. Total lipids
were analyzed gravimetrically after extraction with chloroform–
methanol (2:1) (Folch et al. 1957). Total carbohydrate content
was calculated by difference. Fatty acids in the lipid extractswere ‘‘transesteriﬁed’’ to meth yl esters with 1% sulfuric acid:
methanol complex (Christie, 1982). Fatty acid methyl esters
(FAME) samples were extracted into hexane and stored at–80 /C176C. Fatty acids were analyzed in a Thermo Finnigan-GC
Focus gas chromatograph equipped with a ﬂame ionization
detector (260 /C176C). Fatty acid methyl esters were separated with
a capillary column (Supercowax 28 m 30.32 mm 30.25 i.d.)
using helium as the carrier gas under the conditions described
by Izquierdo et al. (1989). Individual FAME were identiﬁed
by reference to well-characterized external standards (Sigma),and the relative amount of each fatty acid was expressed as
a percentage of the total amount of fatty acids in the analyzed
sample.
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Statgraphics
Plus 5.1 software. (Manugistics, Rockville, MD). Assumption
of normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed withstandardized skewness and kurtosis, and Bartlett /C213s test. Anal-
yses of variance (1-way ANOVAs) were performed to compare
proximate biochemical composition as well as settlement, sur-vival rate, and DGR among treatments. Data showing signif-icant differences ( P<0.05) were analyzed by paired comparisons
using Tukey /C213s HSD test. Multiple regression analyses were
carried out to explain the variation in settlement, growth, andsurvival among treatments. The proximate biochemical com-
position of the algal cues—proteins, lipids, ash, and carbohy-
drate contents—were the factors selected for the analyses.Principal component analysis was performed on the data of
fatty acids composition of the algal cues, and principal com-
ponents were identiﬁed. Kendall rank correlation between themain principal components and settlement, growth, and sur-vival data was then performed to identify the effects of fatty
acid composition and their variations among treatments.RESULTS
Estimates of Algal Cover
The percent coverage of the different substrates, indepen-
dent of age and algal species, ranged between 39.85 ±7.43% and
46.67 ±7.88% at the time of larval settlement. The differences in
algal percent coverage among treatments were not signiﬁcant
(F7,72¼1.40, P¼0.22).
Larval Settlement
The number of settled larvae was signiﬁcantly higher on
CCA and the combination of old Ulvella lens andUlva rigida
treatment (F 7,16¼207.51, P<0.001; Fig. 1), whereas the latter
did not induce signiﬁcantly higher larval settlement than the oldU. rigida treatment ( P>0.05). Forty-eight hours after the
introduction of the larvae, an average settlement rate of 61 ±6%
was achieved with CCA (Fig. 1), followed by settlement rates of52±0.6% and 46 ±7% with the combination of old U. lens and
U. rigida and old U. rigida treatments, respectively. In contrast,
larval settlement rates on young U. lens and young U. rigida
were not signiﬁcantly different ( P>0.05), reaching 14 ±2% and
10±0.6%, respectively, and were signiﬁcantly lower ( P<0.01)
than the settlement rates induced by CCA, the combination of
oldU. lens andU. rigida, and old U. rigida treatments. Finally,
the lowest larval settlement rates (F
7,16¼207.51, P<0.001)
were observed on young U. lens andU. rigida combination, old
U. lens and enriched old U. lens treatments, with insigniﬁcantly
different values ( P>0.05) of 3 ±1.5%, 3 ±0.6% and 4 ±0.7%
respectively (Fig. 1).
Postlarval Growth and Survival
After 4 wk of the experimen t, the young and old combi-
nations of Ulvella lens and Ulva rigida produced the largest
postlarvae, with an average of 1,144 ±113mma n d1 , 2 4 9 ±133mm
in shell length, respectively (Fig. 2).
Daily growth rates of postlarvae weekly fed 200 mL of 106
cells/mL diatom mix ( Navicula incerta ,Proschkinia sp.,Nitzschia
sp., and Amphora sp.) during the 4 wk were signiﬁcantly higher

rigida (F7,72¼22.77, P<0.001). Postlarvae exhibited the lowest
DGR on young U. rigida treatment with 23 ±4mm. This value
was signiﬁcantly lower than those observed for the young and
old combinations of U. lens andU. rigida (F7,72¼22.77, P<
0.001; Table 1).
Postlarval survival, 4 wk after settlement, was signiﬁcantly
higher (F 7,16¼127.16, P<0.001) for the young combination of
Ulvella lens andUlva rigida , with 92 ±7%. In contrast, survival
rates were signiﬁcantly lower (F 7,16¼127.16, P<0.001) on old
U. lens, young U. rigida, and enriched old U. lens, but not sig-
niﬁcantly different among the 3 substrates ( P>0.05; Table 1).
Biochemical Composition of Algae and Outcome on Settlement, Survival,
and Growth
The proximate biochemical composition of the different
settlement cues is shown in Table 2. Overall, CCA showed
signiﬁcantly the lowest protein (F 7,16¼360.3, P<0.001) and
lipid contents (F 7,16¼146.87, P<0.001), whereas enriched old
Ulvella lens had the highest protein content (F 7,16¼360.3, P<
0.001), as well as the highest lipid content together with oldU. lens. Accordingly, CCA had the highest ash content whereas
enriched and unenriched old U. lens had the lowest ash levels
(F
7,16¼670.83, P<0.001). The highest carbohydrate contentwas obtained in the combined old U. lens and Ulva rigida
treatment, without signiﬁcant differences from old U. lens or
oldU. rigida as opposed to the young U. rigida treatment, which
showed a signiﬁcantly lower carbohydrate content (F 7,16¼
227.91, P<0.001).
The mean amounts of fatty acids for each algal cue tested are
given in Table 3. The fatty acids found in highest proportion
in all treatments were saturated fatty acid (particularly, 16:0(palmitic acid)), monounsaturated fatty acids (including 16:1n-7
(palmitoleic acid), 18:1n-9 (oleic acid), 18:1n-7), and PUFAs
18:2n-6 (linoleic acid), 18:3n-3 (linolenic acid), 20:4n-6 (arach-idonic acid (ARA)), 20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)),
and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). The fatty acid pro-
ﬁle varied among the treatments, hi ghlighting the difference in the
CCA treatment in comparison with the green algae by presentingthe lowest amount of monounsaturated fatty acids—particularly,
18:1n-9 and 18:1n-7—and the highest amount of PUFAs, es-
pecially ARA and EPA. Old Ulvella lens and young Ulva rigida
were the 2 green macroalgae treatments that presented the
highest EPA content. The enriched old U. lens treatment pre-
sented the lowest amount of saturated fatty acid and DHA aswell as the highest amount of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-7, and 16:4n-3. In
general U. rigida, both at young and old ages, was higher than
U. lens in n-6 fatty acid contents—particularly, ARA and lin-
oleic acid. In both species, the older the algal culture the higher
the ARA content and the lower the linoleic acid content. In
contrast, nutrient enrichment of the culture medium increasedthe levels of linoleic acid in enriched old U. lens in comparison
with old U. lens, but reduced other polyunsaturated fatty acid
contents such as ARA, EPA, or DHA. Last, old U. rigida was
also characterized by high 18:1n-9 and 22:1n-9 contents, whichwere also reﬂected in the fatty acid composition of the mixture
of old U. rigida and old U. lens.
Figure 3 shows the results of the principal component
analysis of the fatty acids composition from the different algal
substrates. Based on the Eigenvalues, 7 components were ex-
tracted to describe the data. The ﬁrst 2 components accountedfor 50% of the total variance found among the different fattyacid composition of the algal cues, the ﬁrst component being
the most signiﬁcant and explaining 33% of the total variance.
Based on the ﬁrst 2 components, Figure 3 shows that the fattyacids proﬁles of CCA, enriched old Ulvella lens, oldU. lens in
combination with old Ulva rigida, and old U. lens treatments are
the furthest from each other. The ﬁrst component presented thehighest correlation level with the fatty acids 14:1n-7, 16:2n-6,
16:3n-1, 16:3n-3, 16:4n-3, 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3,
ARA, and EPA, denoting that they were the ones likely to beinvolved in differentiating CCA from the enriched old U. lens
treatment. The second component presented the highest corre-
lation level with the fatty acids 18:1n-5, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-4, 18:2n-9,20:1n-9 +n-7, 20:2n-9, 22:1n-9, 20:3n-6, and EPA, suggesting
that they are likely to be involved in differentiating old U. lens in
combination with old U. rigida from the old U. lens treatment.
The protein content of the algal substrate correlated nega-
tively to the settlement rate (Fig. 4). The amount of protein was
the only variable retained in the multiple regression model to
explain the variation in settlement rates among the 8 experi-mental algal cues tested.
A Kendall rank correlation was carried out among larval set-
tlement and the ﬁrst components of the principal component anal-ysis of the fatty acids (Fig. 3). The ﬁrst component, differentiating

(P<0.05) with settlement, indicating that composition of the
substrate in the fatty acids 14:1n-7, 16:2n-6, 16:3n-1, 16:3n-3,
16:4n-3, 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3, ARA, and EPAcould play a role in the settlement process.
Postlarvae survival rate correlated negatively to the protein
content of the algal substrate (Fig. 5). Algal cues’ protein contentwas retained as the parameter, from the model, accountable for
survival rates’ variations between the 8 experimental algal cues
tested due to its elevated correlation with larval survival. Therelationship between protein content and postlarvae survivalrate was found to be signiﬁcant (adjusted R
2¼0.39, F ¼16.04,
P<0.01).
The Kendall rank correlation carried out between growth
and survival and the ﬁrst components of the principal compo-
nent analysis of the cues fatty acid composition showed that
component 2 had a signiﬁcant correlation ( P<0.05) with sur-
vival, reﬂecting the fact that survival could depend principally
on the following fatty acid proﬁle: 18:1n-5, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-4,
18:2n-9, 20:1n-9 +n-7, 20:2n-9, 22:1n-9, 20:3n-6, and EPA.
Growth was not correlated with the proximate composition
of the substrates and was only moderately correlated with com-
ponents 1 and 2, indicating that the proximate or fatty acidcomposition of the algal substrate does affect postlarval growthsigniﬁcantly.
DISCUSSION
The current study on Haliotis tuberculata coccinea showed
the good potential of the germlings of Ulva rigida for settlement
induction, and it investigated links among settlement attrac-
tiveness of the substrate, and postlarval growth and survival.
Larval Settlement
Larval settlement of Haliotis tuberculata coccinea was the
highest on CCA, as shown in previous studies (Courtois deVicxose et al. 2010) and in many other abalones species (Daume
et al. 1999, Daume et al. 2000). Larvae settled particularly well
on plates colonized with old Ulva rigida , and with a mixture of
Ulvella lens andU. rigida germlings grown for 45 days. Despite
the fact that Huggett et al. (2005) reported that Haliotis rubra
settle on Ulva australis andUlva compressa plants, the current
study reports for the ﬁrst time that H. tuberculata coccineaexhibit a strong settlement response to germlings of U. rigida,
which are to be considered settlement inducers of high potential.
In the current study, young Ulvella lens and young Ulva
rigida treatments presented a high number of small individual
patches, whereas the corresponding older treatments presented
fewer larger patches. Although differences in algal develop-
mental stages were observed among age-differentiated treat-ments, as reported in other studies (Daume et al. 2004), the algal
percent coverage was similar in both young and old treatments.
Despite the similarity in algal percentage coverage of all treat-ments, settlement rates of Haliotis tuberculata coccinea were
signiﬁcantly different among treatments and therefore illustrate
the statement of Daume and Ryan (2004), suggesting that the
developmental stage and maturity of U. lens is more important
for settlement induction than its percent coverage. We could
expect a similar algal developmental stage effect of U. rigida
based on the higher settlement rates recorded on old U. rigida
than on young U. rigida in the current study. Apart from algal
development stage, additional factors could be involved in
larval settlement by green macroalgae germlings. Effectively,a 14% settlement rate was recorded on young U. lens forHaliotis
laevigata (Daume & Ryan 2004) and H. tuberculata coccinea
in the current study, independent of the abalone species testedand age of U. lens . On the contrary, the settlement of H. tuber-
culata coccinea was lower on old U. lens than on young U. lens,
in contrast to the settlement results obtained with H. laevigata
(Daume & Ryan 2004). This suggests that settlement differencescould also depend on algae species speciﬁcity, their surface
texture or topography, and their proximate biochemical com-
position known to be affected by age and culture conditions ofthe algal substrate.
The result of the multiple regression analysis of the settle-
ment suggested that the protein content of the substrate mayexplain some of the variation in settlement rates, possiblyassociated with a variation in the amino acids content and their
proportions. Amino acids have been recognized as strong feed
attractants that facilitate ﬁsh larvae /C213s food particle recognition
(Kolkovski et al. 2009) and were found to affect growth and
survival of Haliotis rubra juveniles because imbalanced pro-
portions of some amino acids, in algal diets, could be limiting(Daume et al. 2003). Variation in amino acid content could also
be related to peptide molecules found to be involved in set-
tlement induction and metamorphosis regulation in reef-buildingcorals (Iwao et al. 2002, Erwin & Szmant 2010) and proposed asTABLE 2.

& Morse 1984, Morse 1985). Settlement rates on old and oldenriched Ulvella lens (3% and 4%, respectively) were lower
compared with those of 20%, 40%, and 61% reported for
H. rubra andHaliotis laevigata in other studies (Daume et al.
2000, Daume & Ryan 2004, Daume et al. 2004). Both old and
old enriched U. lens presented the highest lipid content, the
latter being thought to be detrimental for abalone growth (Britz& Hecht 1997), and variations in a substrate /C213s lipid content
also affects its fatty acid proﬁle. A well-balanced biochemical
composition, rather than high individual components contents,seems to be necessary to obtain good settlement rates, as sug-gested for older abalone stages (Strain et al. 2006).
Fatty acids play an important role as membrane constituents
(Jensen et al. 1990) and were reported to play a role in inductionof larval metamorphosis by disturbing the cell membranes. In
the current study, the algal substrates were differentiated by
their fatty acid composition, and only a few fatty acids were
correlated to the settlement process. Studies on sea urchin set-
tlement have isolated fatty acids from coralline red algae and
Ulvella lens responsible for settlement induction and highlighted
the positive effect of certain fatty acids (Kitamura et al. 1993,
Takahashi et al. 2002). In the current study, 18:1n-7, 18:2n-6,
16:4n-3, 18:3n-3, ARA, and EPA contents in CCA, U. lens andUlva rigida correlated positively with settlement and were
common to the ones identiﬁed by Kitamura et al. (1993) andTakahashi et al. (2002) for settlement induction of sea urchin.
Particularly, ARA was highest in CCA and old U. rigida,
leading to the highest settlement rates, whereas it was lower inyoung U. rigida , leading to lower settlement rates.
This study showed that Haliotis tuberculata coccinea larvae
may distinguish between algal substrates, their different devel-opmental stages, and biochemical composition, and that germ-
lings of the green algae Ulva rigida are suitable for improving
larval settlement.
Postlarval Growth and Survival
Settlement-inducing substrates were also considered for
their effects on early postlarval growth and survival. Postlarvalgrowth was not correlated to the proximate biochemical com-
position of the substrate or its fatty acid composition, which
could be explained by the fact that at 4 wk postsettlement,postlarvae growth is dependent primarily on diatom ingestion
and it is likely that postlarvae are not yet capable of accessing
larger particles, such as macroalgae germlings, from the substrate

ingested effectively by abalone with a shell length smaller than
3 mm; this could also be applied to Ulva rigida. Daume et al.
(2000) showed that the green alga U. lens is not nutritionally
adequate for the initial growth of Haliotis rubra postlarvae,
with a growth rate of 13 mm/day, and that it was necessary to
enhance U. lens with diatoms to sustain postlarval growth.
Growth rates obtained for U. lens andU. rigida in the current
study are within the range of those reported on U. lens
supplemented with diatoms by Daume and Ryan (2004) and
Daume et al. (2004) (26–40 mm/day). Growth rates are also in
agreement with the results obtained by Daume et al. (2000) (27–
39mm/day) and Gordon et al. (2006) (20–35 mm/day), and within
the range of those (25–37 mm/day) reported by Kawamura and
Takami (1995) and Daume et al. (1999) for postlarvae feedingon diatoms. As suggested earlier, these results indicate that
postlarval growth, in this experiment, was sustained by diatoms
and not by the macroalgal substrate; therefore the signiﬁcantgrowth differences observed among treatments were linked to
the effects of the settlement substrate on diatoms ingested by the
postlarvae.
Daume et al. (2004) demonstrated a strong negative corre-
lation between the percent coverage of Ulvella lens and the
diatom density and associated bioﬁlm on settlement plates asolder plates, presenting a lower U. lens , showed higher diatoms
densities resulting from the competition for space between the
algae.
Taking into account that postlarvae of all treatments were
reared in the same conditions, fed an identical mixture of 4
diatoms weekly, and that all the substrates tested presented a
similar percent algal coverage, the differences in postlarvalgrowth observed among algal substrates are unlikely to be at-
tributable to space availability for diatoms to grow or original
number of diatoms cells inoculated in each treatment. The dif-ferences in postlarval growth among treatments are therefore
suggested to be inﬂuenced by the macroalgal substrate itself and
linked to its effect on the extracellular polysaccharide secretedby the diatoms or on associated bacteria known to inﬂuencediatom growth (Holmstrom et al. 1996) and nutritional value
(Kawamura 1996, Roberts et al. 1999, Daume 2006).
Protein content and various identiﬁed fatty acids involved in
the differentiation of the different algal substrates were corre-
lated to Haliotis tuberculata coccinea postlarval survival, as
observed for settlement rates. Their effect on postlarval survivalcould have been the result of the recognized antialgal or
antibacterial properties of peptides and fatty acids (Alamsjah
et al. 2008, Dorrington & Gomez-Chiarri 2008, Desbois &Smith 2010). These properties possibly affected diatom growth
and reduced exposure of postlarvae to pathogens or bacterial
infections, as was observed for Artemia nauplii (Defoirdt et al.
2006), and therefore inﬂuenced the survival of H. tuberculata
coccinea postlarvae. The fatty acids correlated with survival
were different from the those associated with settlement, with
the exception of EPA. This PUFA is correlated with macro-algae food value, therefore promoting growth in Haliotis discus
hannai andH. tuberculata juveniles (Mai et al. 1995, Dunstan
et al. 1996, Mai et al. 1996), and was found to accumulate inabalone foot muscle independently of species, age, and diet
(Dunstan et al. 1996). Other identiﬁed fatty acids, such as 18:2n-
9 and 20:1n-9 +1n-7, may have been used as energy sources and
consequently affected survival.It would of interest to investigate further the effect of fatty
acids from green algae germlings on abalone settlement and
to evaluate their nutritional impact on postlarval growth and
survival because they are among the best algal diets identiﬁedfor several abalone species (Mai et al. 1996, Daume et al. 2004,Strain et al. 2006).
Biochemical Composition of Algae
Algae proximate biochemical and fatty acid compositions
differed among species, culture conditions, and algal develop-mental stages, which is in agreement with previous studies
(Thompson et al. 1993, Fabregas et al. 1996, Shpigel et al. 2000).
The differences in proximate biochemical composition ofUlvella lens andUlva rigida treatments observed here provide
a good illustration of this phenomenon. Protein content of both
old and young U. lens was lower than that observed for the same
species (34.3%) by Daume and Ryan (2004), whereas lipid
content was higher in old U. lens (7%) in the current study.
These differences can be relat ed to variations in the culture
conditions between both studies or in the algal developmentalstage, because in our study older algal cultures were associated
with increased lipid and reduced ash content. The increased
protein and lipid contents observed for enriched old U. lens
(29.1% and 7.7%, respectively) compared with the unenriched
oldU. lens (14.9% and 7%, respectively) demonstrate the effects
of the culture conditions on the algal biochemical composition.The alga U. rigida presented higher protein content than U. lens
in similar growing conditions as well as lower protein and lipid
content than those reported by Strain et al. (2006) for other Ulva
species (32.3% and 7.1%, respe ctively). Such differences in
proximate biochemical composition could be linked to species
speciﬁcity, genetic differences, or differences in environmental
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS
The effects of germlings of the green macroalgae Ulva rigida
on settlement, growth, and survival of Haliotis tuberculata
coccinea were evaluated for the ﬁrst time. Larvae showed high
settlement rates on CCA, on a combination of mature greenalgae Ulvella lens andU. rigida as well as on mature U. rigida
alone. Postlarval growth rates were also the highest on a com-
bination of mature U. lens andU. rigida. A dual combination of
green algal cues was beneﬁcial for H. tuberculata coccinea larval
settlement, growth, and survival. The study also showed that
the biochemical composition of the algal substrates is affectedby developmental stages, as well as the culture conditions, of the
algae and that the biochemical composition is likely to impact
postlarval settlement and survival.
These results suggest that green macroalgae play an impor-
tant role in the early life of abalone, and a better understanding
of their role is required because it could have an implication in
the recruitment of abalone larvae to benthic populations and itcould improve abalone culture performance. Ulvaceae species
present great potential because they are ubiquitous, fast grow-
ing, and easily cultured, in contrast to the slower growing CCA.
Further research investigating development techniques for
Ulvaceae spores culture and green algae may provide strong
settlement cues for larvae, inﬂ uence diatom characteristics
positively to sustain early pos tlarval growth, and provide aCOURTOIS DE VICxOSE ET AL . 1196diet for juvenile abalone in hatcheries, such as allowing the
development of reliable applicable techniques for Haliotis
spp. settlement and nursery rea ring. Such advances could,
consequently, improve the sustainability of abalone postlarvaeproduction.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
