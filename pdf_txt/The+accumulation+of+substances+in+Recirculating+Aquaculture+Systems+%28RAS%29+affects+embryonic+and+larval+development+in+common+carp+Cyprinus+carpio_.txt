INTRODUCTION
Interest in culturing fish in recirculating aquacul-
ture systems (RAS) has been increasing recently, asusing RAS could greatly reduce the need for water,land, and energy and lessen the release of nutrientsfrom aquaculture operations to the environment(Martins et al. 2011) when compared with e.g. pondculture. In recirculating systems, the daily waterexchange rate is reduced 30 to 50 times compared tothat of an open system. Moreover, RAS can be closeto a closed system, with less than 10% daily water
exchange (Deviller et al. 2005). Therefore, dissolvedsubstances such as heavy metals, which are notremoved by water treatments in RAS, will accumu-late in the water of the system to such levels that theycan be toxic to the fish (Deviller et al. 2005). Growthretardation, embryonic and larval developmentimpairment and other sub-lethal effects have beenobserved in many fish species cultured in RAS withlow water exchange rates (Davidson et al. 2009,2011, Martins et al. 2009).

ABSTRACT: There is a growing trend towards culturing fish in intensive recirculating aquacul-
ture systems, which have a reduced need for water exchange compared to many other systems.However, it is unknown whether these intensive aquaculture operations facilitate bioaccumula-tion of trace elements in fish tissue. The present study therefore evaluated and compared theaccumulation of 20 trace elements in the flesh of marbled eel Anguilla marmorata reared in 3 dif-
ferent systems: a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), a biofloc technology system (BFT), anda concrete pond (CP; traditional method). In the BFT system fish were also raised in polyculturewith tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and water spinach Ipomoea aquatica Forsk. Fish were fed the
same feed and reared in water from the same source. The trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Be, Co, Cr,Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, and Zn) in the fish flesh were analyzed by induc-tively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Fish reared in the RAS had elevated concen-trations of only a single element (Al) compared with CP fish. This element was also elevated inBFT fish and was probably related to the high Al concentration in the fish feed. Fish reared in theBFT system also showed significantly higher levels of As, Ba, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, and Zncompared to both CP and RAS fish. The observed levels of (1) As in fish from BFT systems and (2)Pb in fish from both RAS and BFT systems exceeded national and international legislatory limits.Our results suggest that regular monitoring of trace element concentrations in BFT and RASshould be implemented in the future for this species.

possibility of metal accumulations in the edible tis-
sues of cultured fish (Martins et al. 2011).
Biofloc technology (BFT) is a new technology used
in aquaculture to allow the effective removal of nutrients while simultaneously producing beneficial
microbial biomass under controlled conditions (Crabet al. 2007). This technology is largely used in shrimpand fish culture because it results in e.g. high pro-duction yields, feed protein recycling, better waterquality, and bacterial infection control (Avnimelech& Kochba 2009, Luo et al. 2014, Bakar et al. 2015). Inthe BFT system, the water is not changed and carbo-hydrates are usually added to the system to produceflocs, which provide a food source for fish. BFT canalso be combined with polyculture technology to fur-ther enhance water quality within the rearing system(Crab et al. 2012). To our knowledge, the trace ele-ment concentrations in fish cultured in a biofloc sys-tem and in fish cultured by traditional methods suchas concrete ponds (CPs) have not been compared.
Anguillid eels have high nutritional value and are
one of the most important commercial species inChina. Because the glass eels of Anguilla marmorata
are easier to obtain and sold at a lower price thanother eel species, cultivation of A. marmorata has in -
creased in southeastern China in recent years (Luo etal. 2013). A. marmorata are cultured in both exten-
sive and intensive systems and are highly suitable forrecirculating aquaculture systems, allowing for a lesswater-intensive and thus more sustainable and envi-ronmentally friendly production.
The present study aimed to compare the concen-
trations of 20 trace elements in A. marmorata cul-
tured in 3 different systems (RAS, BFT, and CP). Wehypothesized that any differences in trace elementaccumulation would be mostly due to the culturemethod. The primary objectives of the study were: (1)to determine if marbled eel reared in highly closedRAS tanks have higher trace element levels thanthose reared in CPs and (2) to determine if eelsreared in BFT systems have different trace elementlevels compared with those reared in RAS or CPs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We obtained 7500 eels (mean weight about 50 g)
from Jixiang Marbled Eel Fisheries Company(Fujian, China). The fish were acclimated for 2 wkin 4 cone fiberglass tanks (working volume 1.0 m
3,
500 eels per tank) or 18 rectangular concrete ponds(5 × 3 × 1.2 m, 300−400 eels per pond) locatedin cement houses at the Binhai research station ofShanghai Ocean University (Shanghai, China). Dur-
ing the acclimation period, the fish were fed to satia-tion twice daily (at 6:00 and 18:00 h) with a commer-cial feed (moisture ≤10%; crude protein ≥ 48.0%;
crude fat ≥ 4.0% and ash ≤17.0%) produced by the
Gaonong Feed Company (Fujian, China). The watersource for this study was the Dazhi River, which islocated in Binhai Town of PuDong New District,Shanghai, China. The river water was precipitated ina sedimentation tank and filtered by a sand filter toremove big particles before usage. One-third to one-half of the water in the acclimation tanks or pondswas replaced daily to ensure good water quality. Dis-solved oxygen was maintained above 5 mg l
−1, pH
ranged from 7.0 to 8.0, temperature ranged from24 to 25°C, and a natural photoperiod was applied.
After acclimation, fish were haphazardly assigned
to the 3 production systems: concrete ponds (5 × 3 ×1.2 m, 100 eels per pond), biofloc ponds (5 × 3 × 1.2 m,100 eels per pond) and RAS tanks (working volume1.0 m
3, 200 eels per tank) with 3 replicates for each
system. The numbers of fish stocked in RAS werehigher than the other 2 rearing systems because RASis generally more intensive than traditional pond cul-ture. This difference in initial stocking number didnot impact the growth performance of the fish (see‘Results’ and ‘Discussion’). CPs consisted of a mono-culture of Anguilla marmorata with one third of the
water being exchanged every 10 d. BFTs consisted ofa polyculture of eels, tilapia Oreochromis niloticus
(average weight 75 g, 16 fish per tank) and waterspinach Ipomoea aquatica Forsk without any water
exchange but with production of bioflocs. The RAStanks contained a monoculture of eels and was anearly closed system (less than 10% of water wasexchanged daily to supplement the water loss fromevaporation and back wash of the drum filter). Thefeeding regime was the same as during acclimation. 
After 70 d, 5 fish were collected haphazardly from
each pond or tank (n = 15 per system), weighed andtheir length measured (Table 1). The sampled fish ex -
hibited no significant difference in weight or length14

among groups (ANOVA, p ≥ 0.05), which eliminated
the effect of fish size on trace element concentrationin fish tissues.
The fish were sacrificed by a blow to the head,
eviscerated, skinned, filleted, and trimmed manuallywith a ceramic knife to obtain the dorsal muscle. Themuscle from each fish was washed with distilledwater and stored at −70°C. The frozen samples werefreeze-dried to a constant weight. Afterwards, sam-ples were homogenized using a grinder and stored indesiccators until further analysis.
All fish samples were analyzed by the Instrumental
Analysis Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(Shanghai, China). The samples were digested fol-lowing the protocol by Lee et al. (2006). Briefly, 0.5 gof fish sample was digested in nitric acid and per-chloric acid (4:1 vol:vol). Subsequently, samples weresubjected to elemental analysis by inductively cou-pled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (iCAP6300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 elements: alu-minum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be),cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo),nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se),tin (Sn), strontium (Sr), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V),and zinc (Zn). The results are shown as µg g
−1of dry
weight. Except for the metalloids As, Sb, and Se,these elements are all metals.
All glassware used during the analysis was soaked
in diluted HNO
3solution (5−10%) for 48 h and rinsed
4 times with deionized water prior to use. A proce-dural blank was run after each batch of 12 samples,and measurements of blanks were subtracted fromsample values. The accuracy of the trace elementmeasurements was assessed using certified refer-ence material of oyster tissue (1566a, National Insti-tute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg,MD, USA), and the recovery of the trace elementsranged between 90 and 112%.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
v17.0 (IBM). Differences in length and weight of mar-bled eels and in the trace element concentrationsamong fish from the 3 culture systems were as -
sessed using 1-way ANOVA followed by a Duncan’smul tiple comparison test if a significant difference
(p < 0.05) was detected. Normality of the data waschecked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Homo-geneity of variances was assessed using Levene’stest. A non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test and itspost hoc test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) were used forBe, Fe, Mn, Sn, Sr, Ti, and Zn since data did not fit theparametric assumptions of normality and homogene-ity of variances. Results are given as mean ± SE.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Difference of trace elemental levels in
Anguilla marmorata from the three culture systems
As stated earlier, the sampled fish exhibited no sig-
nificant difference in weight or length among groups(ANOVA, p ≥ 0.05), which eliminated the effect of fish
size on trace element concentration in fish tissues (seeTable 1). As a promising new technology, the BFT hasbeen successfully used to culture fish such as Africancatfish (Clarias gariepinus) and tilapia (Oreochromis
niloticus) . In a BFT system, water is usually not
changed (Luo et al. 2014, Bakar et al. 2015), creatingthe risk of bioaccumulation of dissolved substances(Deviller et al. 2005). This can be offset by utilizingpolyculture to improve water quality (Crab et al.2012), as the nutrients in the BFT  systems could be
more efficiently used by several species with differentfeeding niches (Rahman et al. 2008). However, in fishfrom the BFT system, we found significantly higherconcentrations of 11 elements (As, Ba, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni,Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, and Zn) (all ANOVAs: p < 0.05; Table 2).Among these elements, As, Ba, Sn, and Ti are toxictrace elements, while the others are essential trace el-ements (Qin et al. 2015). The Fe concentration in fishcultured in the BFT system was 109.64 µg g
−1, which is
much higher than in fish reared in CP or RAS.Previous studies from Turkey also reported a widerange of Fe concentrations in fish, e.g. from 64.3 to197 µg g
−1dry weight in 7 lake fish species (Mendil et
al. 2005) or up to 167 µg g−1dry weight in 5 river fish
species (Cyprinus carpio , Capoeta tinca , Leiciscus
cephalus , Carassius gibelio , and Silurus glanis) sam-
pled (Mendil & Uluözlü 2007). By contrast, Fallah etal. (2011) reported low Fe levels (15.47 µg g
−1dry
weight) in rainbow trout. We also found a significantlyhigher Zn concentration in BFT fish (77.01 µg g
−1dry
weight) than in the other  2 groups. By comparison,
5 species of fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss , Cyprinus car-
pio, Lei ciscus cephalus , Capoeta tinca , and Chondros-
toma regium) from a Turkish river had Zn concentra-
tions from 11.6 to 63.5 µg g−1dry weight (Mendil et al.
2010). The Ni concentration in fish from the BFT sys-tem in this study (2.43 µg g
−1) was much higher than
that in fish from the other 2 systems. Similar resultswere reported for Ni levels in different river fish spe-cies in Tokat, Turkey (1.1 to 10.2 µg g
−1dry weight;
Mendil et al. 2010).
Only 1 element (Al) showed significantly higher
concentration in fish reared in RAS than in fish fromthe traditional concrete ponds (ANOVA, F
2,42= 4.66,
p = 0.02). Aluminum, categorized as non-essential15Aquacult Environ Interact 10: 13–20, 2018
element, is potentially toxic to fish in acidified waters
(Abdel Ghani 2015). RAS can accumulate carbondioxide and have a lower pH when the water ex -
change rate is decreased. Attention should be paid toAl toxicity even at low concentrations when the pH isbelow 6.2 in RAS water because of the increase ofsolubility of Al at lower pH (Blancheton et al. 2007).In another study, sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax had a
significantly higher muscle concentration of As, Cr,Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Ti in fish reared in RAS com-pared with fish from a flow-through system (Devilleret al. 2005). An additional RAS study (Martins et al.2009) also reported higher concentrations of As, Cu,Mn, Ni, and Zn in RAS water with a low water ex -
change rate (30 l kg
–1feed d–1) when compared to
RAS water with a high water exchange rate (1500 lkg
–1feed d–1). A further study by Davidson et al.
(2009) on rainbow trout reported that 9 out of 28tested elements (B, Cu, Li, Mg, P, K, Na, S, and Zn)were significantly higher in trout cultured in RASwith low system water flushing rate compared totrout in RAS with higher system water flushing rate,though only Cu reached chronically toxic levels. Thedifferences in the reported mineral concentrationsby different researchers are likely due to elementalaccumulation being affected by many factors, such asfish species, feed used, culturing
period, and RAS-operational char -
acteristics (Martins et al. 2011).However, several re searchers re -
ported the accumulation of cer-tain elements such as Cu in RAS,and much more attention shouldbe paid to these elements (Dev-iller et al. 2005, Davidson et al.2009, 2011, Martins et al. 2009).
Arsenic, categorized as a toxic
element, is harmful to humans(Qin et al. 2015). In the presentstudy, RAS fish had an As levelof 1.18 µg g
−1, which was not sig-
nificantly different from that inCP fish (Duncan’s multiple com-parison test, p = 0.12; Table 2).However, As was found to accu-mulate in fish cultured in RAS inprevious studies. Arsenic accu-mulation impaired larval de -
velopment in the common carpCy prinus carpio (Martins et al.
2009). When Nile tilapia Ore-
ochromis niloticus were cultured
in RAS tanks with 3 different
water exchange rates, the fish from the RAS with alower water exchange rate had a muscle As level of2.88 to 11.2 µg g
−1dry weight as well as As accumu-
lation in the liver (Martins et al. 2011). Finally, theAs concentration in sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax
reared in RAS was 9.8 µg g
−1, which was significantly
higher than that in fish cultured in a flow-throughsystem (Deviller et al. 2005). Attention should there-fore be paid to the accumulation of As in RAS as aprecautionary measure.
Source and uptake of trace elements in
aquaculture systems
The main sources of trace elements in aquaculture
systems with reduced water exchange rate are met-als added to the feed as part of the mineral premixand elements leaching from pipes and fittings (Colt2006). Trace elements are usually added to commer-cial diets in the form of premixes to avoid mineraldeficiencies in fish. The part of the feed that is noteaten by the fish will stay in the culture and re-usewater in an RAS, resulting in the accumulation of cer-tain trace elements such as As, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn(Martins et al. 2009, van Bussel et al. 2014).16

Bold and italic : results from Kruskall-Wallis tests ( Hvalues) since data did not

The feed used in the present study had high con-
centrations of Al, Fe, and Zn (from 100 to 800 µg g−1
dry weight), followed by Cr, Mn, and Sr (>10 µg g−1),
As, Ba, Co, Cu, Li, Ni, Pb, Se, and Ti (>1 µg g−1) and
comparatively low concentrations of Be, Mo, Sb, Sn,and V (Table 3). Zn, Mn, and Cu are added to eelfeed in large quantities as they are essential traceelements for eel (89−183, 32−40, and 8.4−10.5 µg g
−1,
respectively; Yamashita et al. 2006). Those valuesreflect the concentrations found in the feed used inthe present study (Table 3). Other elements, whichare not essential for eel, are contaminants present inthe fishmeal and starch components of the feed(Yamashita et al. 2006).
Mineral concentrations are extremely variable in
fish feeds, as illustrated e.g. by the ranges of ele-ments found in 38 commercial fish feeds in Europe(all per g dry weight): Fe (148−247 µg g
−1), Zn
(80−636 µg g−1), Mn (39−184 µg g−1), Cu (11−54 µg
g−1), Pb (0.9−4.9 µg g−1), Co (2.8−4.6 µg g−1), Ni
(1.0−4.2 µg g−1), Cr (1.4−3.0 µg g−1), and Cd
(0.18−0.34 µg g−1) (Tacon & Silva 1983). There are
many reasons for this variation, including differencesin raw ingredients, the addition of specific macro- ortrace-mineral premixes, and contaminants present in
raw ingredients (Tacon & Silva 1983). The large vari-ation in mineral composition in commercial fish feedsmight result in the accumulation of different traceelements in fish cultured in RAS systems. Mineralcompositions of commercial feed for rainbow troutand haddock differ from that in eel feed (Table 3).Notably, the Fe concentrations in the feed of eel andhaddock are much higher than that in rainbow troutfeed (Table 3), so it is not surprising that the corre-sponding Fe concentrations in the fish themselvesfollow the same pattern (Table 4). The Sr concentra-tion in the eel feed is higher than that in the haddockand rainbow trout feeds; however, the Sr concentra-tion in the eel itself is lower than that in the haddockand rainbow trout (Table 4). This pattern might becaused by factors other than the Sr concentration inthe feed, such as water quality, fish behavior, ormetabolic activity (Yi & Zhang 2012). The Al concen-tration in the eel feed (210.88 µg g
−1) used in the pres-
ent study was much higher than the Al con centration
in the feeds for other previously reported studies onhaddock (4.1 µg g
−1, Table 3), channel catfish (75 µg
g−1dry weight; Li et al. 2015) and Nile tilapia (71.2 µg
g−1dry weight; Martins et al. 2011). The feed was
therefore likely the reason for the high Al concentra-tion in the eels in our low-water-exchange systems(RAS and BFT) when compared to CP fish (Table 2).
Fish bioaccumulate metals from the ambient habi-
tat either from the water or from the feed (Kalantzi etal. 2013). Metals mainly exist in the water in the formof free metal ions, ion pairs, chelates, or hydrolysisproducts. Concentrations of free metal ions are usu-ally rather low in most of the culture water (Boyd2000). For instance, Cu
2+only accounts for a small
portion of the inorganic copper in water, and mostcopper occurs in complex forms (Boyd 2000). Almostall the complex copper is in the form of CuCO
3and
when the pH value is kept constant, the concentra-tion of Cu
2+does not change as the alkalinity in -
creases in the water, but the concentration of CuCO 3
will increase (Boyd 2000). The alkalinity of the sourcewater in the present study was 280 mg l
−1CaCO 3,
which is relatively high compared to most freshwatersources, so the proportion of CuCO
3was likely also
high in this type of water. Cu2+, CuOH+, and CuCO 3
are the main forms of copper taken up by the gills orthe intestinal epithelium of fish (Grosell et al. 2004);therefore, gill uptake was probably an important pro-cess of Cu absorption by Anguilla marmorat a in the
present study. For other trace elements, gill uptakeby fish may be low because of the form that the ele-ments are present in water. For example, Fe
2+is more17

readily available than Fe3+, but in oxygenated water,
Fe2+can be oxidized to Fe3+. Al though iron uptakes
by gills of freshwater fish are greater than by marinefish, diet is the most im portant source of iron in both
environments (Bury & Grosell 2003). 
In BFT systems, water is usually not changed
because carbohydrates are added to the system topromote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria. Theheterotrophic bacteria could assimilate toxic ammo-nia-nitrogen into bacterial biomass, which is subse-quently eaten by the fish, resulting in nutrient recy-cling (De Schryver et al. 2008). Most of the studiesrelated to BFT systems have focused on the dynamicsof inorganic elements such as carbon and nitrogen(e.g. Kamilya et al. 2017). The mechanism of traceelement uptake in this type of system is therefore notyet clear. Therefore, further studies should be con-ducted to investigate the bio-availability of trace elements, mechanisms of aqueous uptake of trace
elements by cultured species, and cross-effects ofaccumulation of several minerals in a BFT system.Moreover, though the trace element concentrationsin tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and water spinach
Ipomoea aquatica Forsk were not measured in this
study, there may be additional trace element accu-mulation in these 2 species and this can be investi-gated further.Comparing the mineral
 concentration in A. marmorata
with other fish species
When comparing the trace ele-
ment concentrations among A. mar-
morata reared in an RAS (present
study) and 2 other species farmed insystems with high water-exchangerate, A. marmorata had higher con-
centrations of As, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb, andZn than rainbow trout Oncorhyn-
chus mykiss cultured in a race-way
system (Table 4). A. marmorata also
had much higher concentrations ofAl, Cr, and Zn than haddock thatwere farmed in a flow-through system (Table 4). Yamashita et al.
(2006) measured the concentrationsof 5 elements that were also evalu-ated in the present study (As, Cu,Mn, Zn, and Se) in wild or farm-raised Japanese eel A. japonica in
5 regions in Asia and reported thefollowing ranges: 0.04−0.92 µg Asg
−1, 0.1−0.2 µg Cu g−1, 0.06−0.25 µg
Mn g−1, 9.0−15.3 µg Zn g−1, and 0.14−0.26 µg Se g−1.
By comparison, the Cu and Zn concentrations weremuch higher in the present study (Table 4). Overall,A. marmorata cultured in RAS in the present study
have higher levels of several trace elements com-pared with those reported previously for other fishspecies.
The concentrations of trace elements in A. mar-
morata were compared with Chinese national food
safety levels (Ministry of Health of People’s Republicof China 2005). For comparison purposes, the wetweight concentration of a trace element given in theregulations was converted to dry weight using a wetweight to dry weight conversion factor of 4 (Onsanitet al. 2010, Hao et al. 2013). The Ministry of Health ofPeople’s Republic of China (2005) only sets maximumallowable residue limits in fish for 4 of the trace ele-ments we tested, namely Pb (2 µg g
−1dry weight), Cr
(8 µg g−1dry weight), As (2 µg g−1dry weight), and Se
(4 µg g−1 dry weight). None of the fish in the present
study exceeded the maximum allowable residue lim-its except for As in fish from the BFT system, with alevel of 2.06 µg g
−1dry weight. The European Com-
mission has considered a much stricter upper limit forPb (1.2 µg g
−1dry weight, EU 2006). The fish we
reared in the RAS and BFT culture systems slightlyexceeded this European limit (Table 2).18

CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated the concentrations of 20
trace elements in Anguilla marmorata reared in 3 dif-
ferent aquaculture systems. Fish cultured in RAStended to accumulate more Al compared with fishreared in a traditional CP, possibly because of thehigh Al concentration in the eel feed in combinationwith the low water exchange rate of the RAS. A. mar-
morata cultured in polyculture with tilapia Ore-
ochromis niloticus and water spinach Ipomoea
aquatica in the BFT system had significantly higher
concentrations of 11 trace elements (As, Ba, Cr, Fe,Mn, Ni, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, and Zn) compared to fish cul-tured in CPs or RASs. Regular monitoring of traceelement concentrations in BFT and RAS systemsshould be implemented in the future, because thelevels of (1) As in fish from BFT systems and (2) Pb infish from both RAS and BFT systems exceedednational and international legislatory limits. The waterexchange rate should be increased if trace elementaccumulation is detected.
