Abstract: Nowadays, cold plasma treatment systems are widely used in many fields such as 
agriculture. It was proven that this technique can improve growth rate  of mushroom grain spawn, b ut 
no research had been done on spawn treatment using cold plasma. Cold plasma surface treatment  
system was developed by using voltages of 2kV to 4 kV and treatment durations of 5s to  60 s were 
used. The results show an improvement of grain spawn hydrophilic properties and growth rate. The 
most suitable parameters to treat mushroom grain spawn were 2.5kV of voltage with treatment time 
of 15s  resulting in increasing growth of mushroom until 5.7cm.  
 
Keywords: cold plasma treatment ; mushroom mycelium ; applied voltages; treatment durations  
 
1. Introduction 
Mushrooms are defined as a type of macro fungus with 
a distinctive fruit body, and they can be grouped into two 
different types: epigeous which means growing above the earth or hypogenous  which means growing underground. 
Mushrooms have two growth phases. T he first phase 
involves the vegetative phase, which only happens in the soil. The second phase is the reproductive phase where the fruiting bodies is seen above the ground. Table 1 shows 
the nutritional value of a few common edible mushrooms.  
 
Table 1. Nutritional value of mushrooms1 
 Along with the vast advancements in modern 
technology findings and developments, many seek different strategies to improve agricultural yields in order to support today’ s ever -increasing population  
2-3). Many 
chemical or physical methods were developed, such as  
fungicides, ozone treatment, pulsed electric field processing, ultraviolet light, and so on. These efforts have shown positive effects in seed dormancy breaking, enhancing seed germination rates, and building resistance 
against diseases. However, these methods have their respective disadvantages, such as significant environmental risks  
4), high machinery costs  5), radiation 
exposures, expensive processing methods or being ineffective at all 
6). For example, con cerns of 
contamination possibilities from corroded electrodes of pulsed electric field equipment 
7) and health implications 
from ozone treatment 8) were raised.  
Cold plasma (CP) technology has proven to be a 
potential competitive approach to solv e the problems 
mentioned earlier and provide  better results. Cold plasma 
is generated when an electric current passes  through a 
carrier gas or air between two electrodes at atmospheric or vacuum conditions  
9). During operation, various plasma 
species, electr ons, ions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are being generated 
10). For example, atomic oxygen (O), hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2), hydroxyl (OH), and so on.  The principle found 
behind the formation of these reactive species lie s in the 
huge mass difference between electrons and neutral 
particles  in the surrounding air, which led to improved 
levels of ionization and dissociation from the collision of activated electrons and heavy particles  
11-12).  
There are many positive effects brought upon by the Nutritional parameters

reactive plasma species generated in a cold plasma. Firstly, 
these species demonstrated bacterial inactivation behaviour . Yusupov et al. 
13) found out from a molecular 
dynamic ’s simulation, that atomic oxygen can dissociate 
bonds which maintains the cell wall integrity of bacteria, leading to a breakdown of the cell wall and leakage of intercellular components. Other effects found are the causing of depressions on the surface of fungi, the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and the increase of antioxidant enzyme activities 
14-15). Furthermore, the 
reactive species are also capable of  increasing  seeds' 
wettability and water uptake, which led to the increased germination efficiency of crops 
16-17). 
It is clear that , cold plasma technology is a better 
alternative in the food and agricultural field. However, no in-depth research has been done and the mechanisms 
behind the plasma -induced effects on mushrooms.  
Better understanding of cold plasma towards the 
mushroom industry is important, as the demand for mushrooms in Malaysia is estimated  to increase along 
with the population due to its health benefits 
18). Besides 
that, there exist a contradictory part, where  cold plasma 
was found to speed up the growth rate of mushroom mycelium and increased the production rates 
19-20). But we 
knew from previous research that cold plasma has fungi deactivation behaviours , which was not the case in this 
study. Hence, there exi st a certain knowledge gap which 
became the basis for this research.  
The objectives of this research were to determine the 
effects of cold plasma on the changes of hydrophilicity, surface morphology, and chemical properties of the mushroom grain spawn. In addition to that, this research aimed to identify the changes in the growth of the 
mushroom mycelium under different applied voltages and treatment durations when the cold plasma generator was being operated. The scope for this research includes design of a cold plasma treatment system, fabricating, and assembling the prototype, treating the mushroom grain spawns under the parameters tested, characterization , and 
finally post -inoculation observation.  
 
2.  Methodology  
2.1  Prototype  design improvement and assembly  
Figure  1 shows the design of a cold plasma treatment 
system. Then, it was fabricated and some of the parts were printed out using 3D printer.  
Pleurotus sajor -caju (P. sajor -caju) mushroom grain 
spawns, or commonly known as grey oyster mushrooms were used as the target specimen to be treated  by using 
cold plasma . The mushroom grain spawns came in 
different shapes, such as circular, ellipsoid, dextrinoid, peanut -shaped, and many more irregular shapes . The 
prototype was connected to a PVM500 Plasma Driver as a power  source for cold plasma generation. The desired 
voltage and treatment duration was set accordingly as shown in Table 2.  Fig. 1: Technical drawing of the final design for the cold 
plasma generator.

-380-Effect of Cold Plasma Voltage and Treatment Duration on the Microstructure and Hydrophilicity of Mushroom Grain Spawn  
 
2.2  Characterisation of the samples   
The surface morphology and microstructure of the 
treated and untreated mushroom grain spawns were 
analysed by  using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
The samples were prepared accordingly as described by 
Mehdizadeh -Kashi A et al.  21) for biological samples. A 
Fourier -transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) analysis 
was carried out to determine the main chemical groups present in the mycelium structure and its changes after 
cold plasma treatment. To generate the FTIR spectra, the 
samples were placed directly on the cleaned diamond/ZnSe crystal, and the pressure arm was rotated 
clockwise to allow good contact of the sample with the 
crystal. The scanning  was performed by attenuated total 
reflection (ATR) from wavelength of 650 to 4 000 cm -1 
with a Perkin -Elmer FT -IR Spectrometer Frontier 
equipped with a universal ATR sampling accessory. This 
wavelength range was chosen to ensure full detection 
coverage of  the OH and fingerprint regions of the sample s 
22). To identify the changes in the hydrophilicity of the 
sample ’s surface, an apparent contact angle (ACA) sessile 
drop technique was applied with an OCA 15EC contact angle measuring device. The samples were first placed on 
the sample table, and a small syringe would dispense 0.3 
µL of water at dosing rate of 1.00 µL/s in contact with the 
sample ’s surface. The water droplet would form a 
hemispherical shape on the surface, where the angle is defined as the angle between the solid surface and the tangent of the dro plet outline. This angle was then 
captured automatically by the device camera for both left 
and right parts of the droplet, and the average angle was calculated using the formula as below:  
 
  𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴  𝐴𝐴 𝑎𝑎𝐴𝐴 𝑎𝑎𝐴𝐴=𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 °  + 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ℎ𝐿𝐿°

3.  Results and Discussion  
Based on the characterisation results obtained  on 
mushroom spawn , it is obvious that cold plasma treatment 
had on effect on the surface morphology, chemical 
functional group changes, and surface hydrophilicity. From Fig . 2, it shows  that the treated grain spawns 
demonstrated a few obvious changes, such as increasing depressions and cracks on the mycelium surface (red arrows), appearance of sclerotia structures (S), and cell wall degradation (Cwd). The presence of oxidative stress caused by ROS will promote the formation of sclerotia for 
better survival rate  
23). When the treatment duration was 
increased gradually, the mycelium structures appeared more folded and collapsed due to the oxidation and interactions of the reactive plasma species with the mycelium.  
The FTIR analysis was being performed to validate the 
effect of cold plasma towards the mycelium surface as seen pre viously in the SEM results. Figure  3 illustrates the 
changes of the FTIR spectrum for the untreated and treated (5 , 15, 30, 45, 60 s) grain spawns, whereas Fig. 4 shows the spectrum when different voltages were being applied (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 kV). From the data, it can be observed on the peak of the O-H signals increase when 
the treatment duration was increased  as well. This could 
be due to the incorporation of O -H groups on the 
mycelium surface during the treatment 
24). When  the 
voltage applied was raise, the peak of the OH signals 
showed a decreasing trend as shown in Fig. 4. This could 
be an indication that dehydration was taking place with potential cell wall changes and the intensified absorption of OH groups onto the surface 
25). The increase in 
intensities for other peaks like C- H and C=C inferred the 
presence of chemical etching and oxidation of the biomolecules at the surface.

The changes in hydrophilicity of the treated grain 
spawns were investigated by using the ACA sessile drop 
technique. Fig ure 5 shows a section of the apparent 
contact angles for both untreated and treated samples. The detailed data is tabulated in both Table 2 and Table 3 for samples of various treatment durations and different applied voltages respectively. A higher value of a pparent 
contact angle indicates that the surface is hydrophobic, whereas a small value shows that the surface is keen to have hydrophilic properties.  
When the treatment duration was increased, it is found 
that the water droplet appeared to be easily absor bed into 
the surface and the apparent contact angles were decreasing as well. The improvement of surface hydrophilicity was primarily caused by the reactive species generated during the cold plasma treatment, OH and O species in particular. OH plays a majo r role in the 
oxidation -reduction biochemical processes on the surface, 
which causes physical and chemical modifications  
26). 
Another reason could be the that the presence of OH and O radicals led to the formation of other polar functional groups such as: carbonyl (C=O) and carboxyl (COOH), which resulted in a much more hydrophilic surface 
27).

 From Fig . 6, it is clear that after cold plasma treatments, 
most of the samples demonstrated an improve ment of  
mushroom growth compared to the untreated samples. 
The untreated sample had an initial 4.95 cm growth within 
the first week. When 2 kV voltage was applied, most of the samples did not show significant growth improvements . The highest growth of 5.29 cm was 
achieved during the 60s treatment  time. It could be a 
reasoned  that 2 kV might not be sufficient to generate the 
reactive plasma species for the faster mycelium growth. 2.5 kV applied voltage gave the most prominent results

among the rest, with three different durations obtaining 
the greatest mycelium growth of 5.69, 5.7, and 5.7 cm during 5, 15, and 45 s  of treatment time respectively .  
From this data, it can be expecting  that 2.5 kV is the 
most suitable applied voltage compared to the other voltages, whereas the most suitable treatment duration lies between 5  s to 45 s. When the voltage was being increased 
to 3 kV , only the first three durations (5, 15, 30 s) were able to improve the mycelium growth. Beyond 45 s treatment, an inhibitory effect on the growth could be observed since the mycelium growth was even lesser than 
the control sample. The same goes for 4 kV , where almost no samples demonstrated mycelium growth after treatment. This could infer that 3.5 kV and 4 kV might not be suitable for the mushroom grain spawns, as the high 
voltage would have killed o ff the mycelium structures on 
the grain spawn surface.

samples.  
 
4.  Conclusion  
It can be concluded that reactive plasma species 
generated during a cold plasma treatment able  to modify 
the surface morphology of the mycelium structures found in P. sajor -caju mushroom grain spawns. After the 
treatment process, cracks, folding, depressions, cell wall degradations could be observed with various degrees of severity. These species could also affect the surface chemical properties of the mycelium, which include the accumulation of OH groups, formation of new functional groups (C=O), oxidation of biomolecules was found to be taking place in the treated samples. Another finding was that improvement of hydrophilic properties on mushroom 
spawn grain was got by reactive plasma species as well. 
This could be the presence of polar and hydrophilic groups on the surface after the treatment.  By increasing both the 
applied  voltage and treatment d urations , it shows  that 
there were more drastic effects compared to the untreated 
samples. It was proven  from the data that voltage of 2.5 kV and duration of 15 s were most suitable to improve the growth of P. sajor -caju mushroom grain spawns.
