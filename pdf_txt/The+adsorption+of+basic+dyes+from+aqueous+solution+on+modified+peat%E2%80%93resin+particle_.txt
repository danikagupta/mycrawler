Abstract
Modiﬁed peat was prepared by mixing thoroughly raw peat with sulfuric acid, and modiﬁed peat–resin particle was
obtained, by mixing modiﬁed peat with solutions of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and formaldehyde. In this paper, theadsorption of Basic Magenta and Basic Brilliant Green onto modiﬁed peat–resin particle is examined. The adsorptionisotherm showed that the adsorption of basic dyes on modiﬁed peat–resin particle deviated from the Langmuir and
Freundlich equations. The pseudo-ﬁrst order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used to ﬁt
the experimental data. By comparing the standard deviation, it was found that the intraparticle diffusion model couldbe used to well describe the adsorption of two basic dyes on modiﬁed peat–resin particle. According to the change of
intraparticle diffusion parameter, the adsorption processes could be divided into different stages. The kinetics
experiment also indicated that initial dye concentrations, particle dose and particle size could affect the adsorptionprocesses of basic dyes.

1. Introduction
Wastewater containing dyes from textile industry is
very difﬁcult to treat using conventional wastewatertreatment methods, since the dyes are stable to light and
oxidizing agents, and are resistant to aerobic digestion
([1,2]). Adsorption techniques to remove dyes in solution
have been widely used. Most commercial systems
currently use activated carbon as adsorbent to remove
dyes in wastewater. Activated carbon is expensive, whichmeans higher cost is in wastewater treatment. In order to
decrease the cost of wastewater treatment, attempts have
been made in ﬁnding inexpensive adsorbents. Studiesshowed that many materials, such as low rank coals,
peat moss, chitosan and wood, could be used asadsorbents [2–5] which could effectively remove the
dyes from solution.
Peat, as an adsorbent, is porous and rather complex
material, containing lignin and cellulose. Recently, peathas been used to remove some pollutants (such as heavy
metals, dyes and oil) from aqueous solution [6–9] . Many
studies showed peat could effectively remove the dyesfrom aqueous solution ( [1,10–15] ). Poots et al. [1,2]
investigated adsorption of acid dye (Acid blue 25) on
peat by ﬁxed bed. And results showed that peat was agood adsorbent for removalof acid bl ue 25. Using batch
adsorption system, Allen et al. [10–12] studied adsorp-
tion processes of acid and basic dyes on peat. In theisotherm experiment of basic dyes, Allen et al. [10]found
the isotherm of basic dyes exhibited deviation from the
theory (Langmuir isotherm equation). They thought thisdeviation was attributed to the pressure of adsorbingions creating a new surface by expanding the adsorbent
particle. Allen et al. [11,12] investigated the diffusion of

used the intraparticle diffusion model to describe theadsorption processes of basic dyes on peat and divided
adsorption processes into separate steps in terms of
diffusion rate parameter.
Peat, as an adsorbent, can effectively remove the
pollutants from solution and is inexpensive. However,
when raw peat is directly used in wastewater treatment,there are many limitations, such as low chemicalstability and mechanical strength, leach of fulvic acid
from peat and difﬁcult regeneration [16]. In order to
overcome these limitations, we prepared the modiﬁedpeat–resin particle by mixing modiﬁed-peat with poly-
vinylalcohol (PVA) and formaldehyde. The modiﬁed
peat–resin particle contains polar functional groups,such as alcohols and acids. Both modiﬁed peat and resin
in particle can adsorb the dyes from solution.
In this paper, the adsorption isotherm and kinetics
experiments of basic dyes (Basic Magenta and basic
Brilliant Green) were conducted and the different kinetic
models were used to analyze adsorption processes ofbasic dyes on modiﬁed peat–resin particle.
2. Materials and methods
Raw peat was obtained from Jilin province, which
was commercially available for agriculture purpose in
China.
2.1. The preparation of modiﬁed peat–resin particle
Raw peat was dried at room temperature, and then
broken using a hammer mill and ﬁnally screenedthrough a 60 mesh sieve. The process of preparing the
modiﬁed peat–resin particle is as follows:
1.Oxidizing peat : raw peat (200 g, d. w.) was thor-
oughly mixed with sulfuric acid (100 ml) in a ﬂask (2l)
at room temperature, which could prepare modiﬁed-
peat.2.Gelling : distilled water (300 ml) was mixed with
modiﬁed-peat and heated it to a boil, then add10% PVA solution (100 ml) and 37% formaldehyde
solution (80 ml) were added with swift, agitation until
‘‘modiﬁed peat–resin gel’’ was formed. Then the‘‘modiﬁed peat–resin gel’’ was broken with a hammar
water was poured into the powdered mixture (200 ml)
and heated it to a boil.
3.Coating : 5% PVA solution (100 ml) was added,
agitating and heating. This step was repeated for
ﬁve or six times.
4.Washing and drying : the particle was washed with
deionized water untilﬁl trate reached pH 5.5—6.5,
then it was dried in an oven at 65 751C for 24 h.
5.Sieving : the particle was crushed and sieved.
With regard to the modiﬁed peat–resin particle,
the basic structure was that resin adhered modiﬁed-peat powder into microparticles and, then, manymicroparticles formed gradually particle with different
size. The modiﬁed peat–resin particle had a macro-
reticular structure. The porosity and the ratio ofmacropore in the modiﬁed peat–resin particle changed
with the particle size. Both modiﬁed-peat and
resin could adsorb the basic dyes in the adsorptionprocesses.
Fig. 1 shows the pore distribution of modiﬁed peat–
resin particle. Fig. 1 , shows that micropore ( o20 (A) and
transitionalpore (20—50 (A) are predominant in the
modiﬁed peat–resin particle.
Table 1 shows the speciﬁc surface area of the particle
(measured by nitrogen adsorption method, ASAP2000,MICROMERTICS). Table 1 shows that the speciﬁc
surface area of modiﬁed peat–resin particle is very low at
different size.
We think the speciﬁc surface area presented in Table 1
is lower than the true one. The low value of speciﬁc
surface area is caused by high temperature in measure-ment. In order to dry the particle, a temperature of
1501C was used in measurement. The temperature of
1501C may seriously cause collapse of pore and/orNomenclature

2.3. Experimental procedure
Adsorption isotherm : modiﬁed peat–resin particle,
0.5000 g was thoroughly mixed into 100 ml of 50—
2400 mg l/C01, and then the container was sealed up to
prevent change of volume of the solution during the
experiments. The size of the particle was 2.5—5.0 mm.
Suspensions were played for eight weeks at a 25 70.51C
constant temperature to ensure that adsorption equili-
brium was established. The equilibrium solution was
ﬁltered using stainless steel sieve (300 mesh, the ﬁrstﬁltrate of 5—10 ml was discarded).
Adsorption kinetics : the particle was thoroughly mixed
with 2000 mldye sol ution in the reaction vesselat
constant temperature (25 1C). 2 mlsampl es were drawn
at suitable time intervals, and ﬁltered through stainless-
steelsieve (300 mesh).
The concentration of dyes in solution sample was
determined using a spectrophotometer with a 1.0 cm
glass light cell at a wavelength corresponding to the
maximum absorbance.0.0000.0010.0020.0030.004

3. Theoretical
The adsorption of dye onto modiﬁed peat–resin
particle can be divided into three consecutive stages.
First, dye migrates through the solution to the exterior
surface of modiﬁed peat–resin particle. Second, the dyemoves within the particle. Then, third, the dye isadsorbed at sites on the interior surface of the modiﬁed
peat–resin particle. Many factors can affect the adsorp-
tion rate of dye on modiﬁed peat–resin particle, such asthe initial dye concentration, particle size, particle dose
and turbulence state of solution. Generally the third
stage is very rapid and does not form a rate-limitingstage in the adsorption.
3.1. Adsorption isotherm
In adsorption isotherm study, adsorption isotherm
equations usually used include Langmuir equation,
Freundlich equation, Redlich–Peterson equation andBET equation. For the liquid–solid system, the Lang-
muir and Freundlich isotherm equations usually are
employed.
3.2. Kinetic models
In order to investigate the adsorption processes of two
basic dyes on modiﬁed peat–resin particle, three kinetic
models are used, including pseudo-ﬁrst-order model,
pseudo-second-order modeland intraparticl e diffusionmodel.
3.3. Pseudo-ﬁrst-order model
The pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation is
dqt
dt¼kfðqe/C0qtÞ; ð3Þwhere kfis the rate constant of pseudo-ﬁrst-order
model. After deﬁnite integration by applying the initial
conditions qt=0att=0and qt=qtatt=t, the equation
becomes [17]:
logðqe/C0qtÞ¼logqe/C0kf
2:303t: ð4Þ
Eq. (4) is a linear form. Plotting the log( qe/C0qt)
against t, a line can be obtained.
3.4. Pseudo-second-order model
The pseudo-second-order modelcan be represented in
the following form [18]:
dqt
dt¼ksðqe/C0qtÞ2; ð5Þ
where ksis the rate constant of pseudo-second-order
model. After integrating Eq. (5) for boundary conditions
t=0tot=tand qt=0toqt=qt, the following form can be
obtained:

Plotting the t/qtagainst t, a line can be obtained and
theqealso can be calculated.
3.5. Intraparticle diffusion model
Theoretically, adsorption rate of the dye onto the
particle depend on the rate of mass transport processesof the dye within the modiﬁed peat–resin particle. For
the porous modiﬁed peat–resin particle, the mass
transport processes may mainly be conformed in theform of diffusion.
In a liquid–solid system, the fractional uptake of the
solute on particle, F, will vary with the function [12]:
D0t0:5

Hence there is a linear relationship between Fand t0.5
for much of the adsorption processes. Fcan be deﬁned
as
F¼ðC0/C0CtÞ=C0: ð7Þ
The diffusion rate of the dye molecule in particle, ki,
can be calculated by the following equation:
ki¼qt=t0:5: ð8Þ
Its linear form is
qt¼k0:5
i ð9Þ
where, kiis the intraparticle diffusion rate.
According to previous studies, the plot of qtagainst
t0.5may present a multi-linearity [12], which indicates
that two or more steps occur in the adsorption
processes. The ﬁrst sharper portion is the externalQ. Sun, L. Yang / Water Research 37 (2003) 1535–1544 1538surface adsorption or instantaneous adsorption stage.
The second portion is the gradualadsorption stage,
where the intraparticle diffusion is rate-controlled. The
third portion is the ﬁnalequil ibrium stage, wherethe intraparticle diffusion starts to slow down due to
the extremely low solute concentration in solution [5,19] .
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Adsorption isotherm
Fig. 2 is the adsorption isotherm of Basic Magenta
and Basic Brilliant Green. With the initial dye concen-
tration increase, the amount of adsorption of dye onmodiﬁed peat–resin particle increased swiftly. No
maximum adsorption value was observed as shown
inFig. 2 .
The data of adsorption isotherm of Basic Magenta
and Basic Brilliant Green could not be described by
isotherm equations of Langmuir and Freundlich. PlotsofC
e/qevs.Ceand ln qevs. ln Cewere not line. The
ﬁtness between experimentaldata and theoretical
models was not good ( r2o0:95). This result is similar
to that of Allen et al. [10].
Allen et al. [10]studied adsorption isotherm of basic
dyes using sphagnum peat, the results show that the
adsorption isotherm of basic dyes deviate from Lang-muir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm equations.
They thought that the deviation could be attributed to
the pressure of adsorbing ions creating new surface byexpanding the adsorbent particle.
The adsorption isotherms indicated that the adsorp-
tion of Basic Magenta and Basic Brilliant Green onmodiﬁed peat–resin particle might be the ‘‘multi-molecular layer in thickness’’.The experiments of the adsorption isotherm showed
that modiﬁed peat–resin particle could effectively
remove both Basic Magenta and Brilliant Green from
the aqueous solution (especially, at a high dye concen-tration). The modiﬁed peat contained an amount of
negatively charged groups and exchangeable ions (such
as H
+) associated with humic acid. The basic dyes could
be adsorbed by electrostatic interactions and ionexchange. Of course, the resin, which contained an
amount of hydroxide ( /C0OH), could also adsorb the
basic dyes by chemicalreaction.
4.2. Kinetics of adsorption
4.2.1. Effect of experimental conditions on adsorption
processes
Figs. 3–6 show the effect of the initialdye concentra-
tion, particle size, agitation speed and particle mass on
adsorption of Basic Magenta. Figs. 3–6 indicate that
adsorption rate of the dye was very fast at the beginningstage and, then, slow down gradually. The initial dye
concentration, particle size and mass could signiﬁcantly
affect the adsorption rate. In Fig. 5 , the adsorption rate
of less than 0.8 mm was between that of 2.5–5.0 and 1.3–
2.5 mm, the reason needs to be investigated further. The
difference of adsorption rate at different agitation speedwas insigniﬁcant. Similar phenomena were observed inthe kinetic experiment of Basic Brilliant Green.
4.3. Test of kinetic models
In order to explore the kinetic processes of adsorp-
tion, it is a good method that using different models to
ﬁt the experimentaldata and comparing the normal ized
standard deviation. Table 2 presents the result of ﬁtting
experimentaldata with pseudo-ﬁrst and pseudo-second-order models and intraparticle diffusion model.

all of the experimental conditions, which indicated that
the intraparticle diffusion model was the best one indescribing the adsorption kinetics of basic dyes on
modiﬁed peat–resin particle. Fig. 7 typically illustrates
the comparison between the calculated and measuredresults for adsorption of Basic Magenta. From Fig. 7 ,i t
was found that the pseudo-ﬁrst and pseudo-second-
models underestimate at the initial stage of adsorption.The measured results indicated that the adsorption rate
was very fast at the beginning stage of adsorption.
4.4. The intraparticle diffusion of basic dye in particle
As mentioned above, the intraparticle diffusion model
could describe the adsorption kinetics of basic dyes well.Fig. 8 is the plot of q
tvs.t0.5at different initialdye
concentration, which indicated that the plot of qtvs.t0.5
was multi-linear. The intraparticle diffusion constants50100150200250300350400450

different stages in the adsorption.From Table 2 , it is seen that the order of adsorption
rate was the ﬁrst stage ( ki1)>second stage ( ki2)>third
stage ( ki3). At the beginning, the dye was adsorbed by
the exterior surface of the modiﬁed peat–resin particle,20406080100120140160180200

so the adsorption rate was very fast. When theadsorption of the exterior surface reached saturation,
the molecular dye entered into the modiﬁed peat–resin
particle by the pore within the particle and was adsorbedby the interior surface of the particle. When the
molecular dye diffused in the pore of the particle,
the diffusion resistance increased, which caused thediffusion rate to decrease. With decrease of the dyeconcentration in the solution, the diffusion rate became
lower and lower, the diffusion processes reached the
ﬁnalequil ibrium stage. Therefore the changes of k
i1,ki2
and ki3could be attributed to the adsorption stages of
the exterior surface, interior surface and equilibrium,
respectively. Allen et al. [12] thought that there were
four separate regions depicting the mass transfer onto
peat, i.e. externalmass transfer effect, macropore
diffusion, transitionalpore diffusion and microporediffusion.
Table 2 shows that all of k
i1,ki2andki3increased with
initialdye concentration. The driving force of diffusionwas very important for adsorption processes. Generally
the driving force changes with the dye concentration inbulk solution. The increases of dye concentration result
in increase of the driving force, which will increase the
diffusion rate of the molecular dye in pore.
k
i1,ki2and ki3decreased with increase of particle
mass. The increase of particle mass usually results in
increase of the exterior surface, which causes swiftdecrease of the dye concentration in bulk solution anddriving force.
Generally, the diffusion rate increases with decreasing
particle size [12]. From Table 2 , it is found that the effect
of diffusion rate on particle size was irregular, which
could be related to structure and chemical components
of modiﬁed peat–resin particle.
Table 2 also indicates that the effect of diffusion rate
on agitation speed was not signiﬁcant. With increase of
agitation speed from 200 to 500 rpm, the change ofdiffusion rates, k
i1,ki2and ki3, was little, which means
that the resistance of particle surface was very low for
molecular dye from bulk solution entering into aTable 2

5. Conclusions
The adsorption isotherm and kinetics of two basic
dyes were studied in batch experimentalsystem. The
following results were obtained:
1. The adsorption isotherm of Basic Magenta and Basic
Brilliant Green deviated from the Langmuir and
Freundlich equations. The adsorption capacity ofBasic Magenta and Basic Brilliant Green on a
modiﬁed peat–resin particle was very high.
2. The adsorption processes of Basic Magenta and
Basic Brilliant Green on a modiﬁed peat–resinparticle could be well described by intraparticle
diffusion model, and the adsorption rate of two
basic dyes on a modiﬁed peat–resin particle wasmainly controlled by the diffusion rate of themolecular dye within a particle.
3. The initial dye concentration could signiﬁcantly
affect the diffusion rate of molecular dye in aparticle. The diffusion rate of basic dyes increased
with initialdye concentration, and decreased with
increase of particle mass.
4. The change of agitation speed did not cause
signiﬁcant difference of intraparticle diffusion para-
meter in experimentalconditions.
