ABSTRACT  
 
 Three different strains of white rot fungi ,i.e, Pleurotus ostreatus , Phanerochaete chrysosporium  and 
Trametes versicolor were evaluated  for decolorization of six textile dyes. P. ostreatus  showed  more effective for 
dyes decolorization  followed by  P. chrysosporium . So, they  were selected and mutagenized using UV as a 
physical mutagen in order to induce genetic variations.  The majority of Pleurotus ostreatus  mutants can 
decolorize dyes with efficien cy higher than the wild type strain especially Acid fast red and Disperse violet 31 
dyes, while most of P. chrysosporium  mutants exhibited negative decolorization effects especially Reactive 
black 5 and Methylene blue dyes.  Frequency analysis of UV  mutants  according to dye decolorization showed 
higher decolorization values and the development of positive mutants of P. ostreatus  compared to  P. 
chrysosporium . P. ostreatus  mutants 7/30 and 14/30,  since mutant 7/30 has ability to decolorize efficiently 
Methyl o range and  Congo red while (14/30) are the most effective methods , decolorize Acid fast red, Reactive 
black 5, Methylene blue and Disperse violet  31.

Introduction  
 
 Synthetic dyes are extensively used in textile dyeing, paper printing, color photography, pharmaceutical, 
food, cosmetic, and leather industries (Kuhad et al., 2004) . The traditional textile finish ing industry consumes 
about 100L of water to process about 1 kg of textile materials (Couto, 2009) . Large scale production and 
extensive application, synthetic dyes can cause considerable environmental pollution and are serious health -risk 
factors (Forgacs et al., 2004) . 
 There is a great need to develop an economic and effective  way of dealing with the textile dyeing waste in 
the face of the ever -increasing production activities ( Park et al., 2007) . Government legislation is becoming 
more and more stringent, especially in more developed countries, regarding the removal of dyes fr om industrial 
effluents (Kuhad et al., 2004) . Over the last decade, azo dyes that could breakdown to carcinogenic aromatic 
amines have been largely phased out in Europe ( Pinheiro et al., 2004) . 
 Fungi, especially white rot fungi have nonspecific ligninolyt ic enzyme system that includes manganese 
peroxidase, lignin peroxidase and laccase can degrade a wide range of dyes. Many white- rot fungi have been 
studied for their decolorization ability (Sathiya  moorthi  et al., 2007; Vasdev, 2011 and Hadibarata, 2013) . 
Pleurotus spp. and Phlebia spp. are being evaluated for dye decolorization to look for friendly solutions for 
decolorization of industrial wastewaters (Casieri et al., 2008) . The realization of these potentials would be 
considerably enhanced, however, if g enetic methods for selecting strains with superior capacities were available 
(Homolka et al., 1995) . 
 Random mutation was introduced for whit e rot fungi using X rays (Gold et al., 1982) , UV- irradiation 
(Cacchio et al., 2003 and Yashvant et al., 2013 ) and G amma irradiation  (Chang et al., 2003) . In some non -
sporulating filamentous fungi, protoplasts are a suitable starting material for mutagenesis (Homolka, 1988) . In 
less sensitive mycelial fungi, mutagenesis of hyphal fragments (Vijaya et al., 2009)  is a met hod of choice. 
Toyomasu et al., (1986)  induced mutation using protoplasts from Pleurotus ostreatus  and Pleurotus salmoneo-
stramineus by UV.  Vijaya  et al., (2009)  obtained mutants strains of Pleurotus ostreatus  with the objective of 
enhancing their lignino lytic activity after exposure of mycelium growing in agar plates to UV light. UV 
irradiation for mutant production from some white rot fungi has been reported. Strains have been produced 
which were altered in cellulase, xylanase, mannanase, amylase, phenol oxidase and lignin peroxidase (LiP) 
activity, LiP regulation and nutrient requirements. In some cases, such as cellulase- deficient mutants of 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , an increase in ligninolytic activity was reported (Addleman et al., 1995) . 
Protoplast preparation and UV -irradiation of mycelial fragments were used to study the variability of production 
of laccase, peroxidase and manganese -dependent peroxidase (MnP) involved in lignin degradation in Pleurotus 5851 
J. Appl. Sci. Res., 9(11): 5850- 5857, 2013  
5851 
 ostreatus  and Lentinus tigrinus . After protoplasting, the variability of production of all enzymes increased 
substantially (Homolka et al., 1995) . 
 The objectives  of this study can be summarized as follows:  Screening of different species of white rot fungi 
to evaluate their ability to decolorize   different textile dye s; genetic improvement of the efficient strain(s) using 
UV mutagenesis protocol; e valuation of the ability of genetically modified strains for dye decolorization using 
their high ligninolytic  enzyme s production .

 2. Methods:  
 
2.1. Screening for dye decolorization in liquid medium:  
 
 Fungal strains grown on  malt extract agar plates were used to inoculate 50 ml of  the above liquid culture 
medium in 250 ml flasks, then incubated at 30Â°C in a rotary   shaking adjusted at  150 rpm. After six days, stock 
solution aliquots of dyes were added to medium. The initial concentrations of dyes in medium were mentioned 
in table 2 , (Fu and Viraraghavany, 2001) . Periodically during  the fungal dye decolorization process, percent 
color removal in liquid was calculated.  
 2.2. Percent color removal in liquid medium:  
 
 The color measurement method developed by Strickland and Perkins (1995)  was used in this study. This 
method is used to m easure the decolorization effect in a dye solution containing one dye or several dyes. For the 
decolorization effect of a dye solution containing a single dye, decolorization was measured 
spectrophotometerically  at the wavelength of peak absorbance of each  dye (table 2 ) using a Shimadzu UV -VIS 
recording spectrophotometer model UV -240. The decolorization percentage calculated by the following 
formula:  Decolorization (%) = (ABT -AAT /ABT) x 100    ; AAT = absorbance after treatment;  ABT =  
absorbance before t reatment . 
 
2.3. Induction of mutation:  
 2.3.1. Pleurotus ostreatus : 
  Protoplast suspension  from Pleurotus ostreatus  were suspended in 0.7 M mannitol.  For UV irradiation , 
Petri dishes containing protoplast suspension was exposed to UV light (30W  Philips ge rmicidal lamp ) at a 
distance of 15 cm in dark for 30, 45 and 60 sec. To avoid photoreactivation, treated protoplasts were kept in dark for about 1 hour. Protoplasts were then diluted with 0.7M mannitol and plated on a malt extract medium 
containing osmotic  stabilizer . The irradiated protoplasts and untreated control, in parallel, were suitably diluted 
with osmotic stabilizer solution and plated for regeneration on solid  agar medium  (Toyomasu et al., 1986).  
 
2.3.2. Phanerochaete chrysosporium : 
 
 For UV irra diation, spores  suspended in sterile distilled water were irradiated in Petri dish at room 
temperature (30Â°C) in the dark under mild agitation. The source of the UV radiation was a (30 -W) lamp. After  
irradiation for 30, 60 and 90 sec. at a distance of 15 cm,  plates were kept for 60 min in the dark to allow full 
expression of the change induced by UV light. The irradiated spores and untreated control, in parallel, were 
suitably diluted with sterile distilled water  and plated on a malt extract medium. Growin g colonies were counted 
against the control plates of the same dilution and transplanted onto a slant for genetic analysis (Gold et al., 
1982) . 
 Results and D iscussion  
 
 The textile industries use large amounts of toxic dyes that pose a threat when dischar ged to the 
environment. The treatment of dye containing wastewater by white rot fungi has shown promising results, but 
needs to be enhanced to  find higher decolorization efficiency for all or most textile dyes used in this study.  
 
1. Evaluation of differen t fungal strains for dye decolorization:  
 
 The efficiency of three white rot fungi for dye decolorization in liquid medium containing a single dye was 
investigated The initial dye concentrations were approximately 6.8 , 67, 100 , 20, 3.3 and  100 mg/L for M ethyl 
orange , Acid fast red, Reactive black5 , Congo red , Methylene blue and  Disperse violet 31,  respectively (Fu and 
Viraraghavany, 2001) . Table ( 3) illustrate the differences  ability  between three white rot fungal strains for dye 
reduction in liquid medium  during three incubat ion periods of fungal treatment . Results showed that Pleurotus 
ostreatus , is the most effective strain for dye decolorization followed by  Phanerochaete chrysosporium . After 
72 hours of incubation,  Pleurotus ostreatus , have the ability  to decolorize Reactive black 5, Congo red and 
Disperse violet 31 with decolorization percentages of 89.56, 91.19 and 91.52,  respectively.  In fact, 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium exhibited nearly the same decolorization trend for Congo red and Disperse violet  
31 dyes since more than 90% and 85% color removal were obtained,  respectively.  However, among six textile 
dyes used in this study (Table 3 ), Methyl orange, Acid fast red and Methylene blue were more resistant to 5853 
J. Appl. Sci. Res., 9(11): 5850- 5857, 2013  
5853 
 decolorization. Color removal percentages w ere 33.16, 21.94 and 44.12,  respectively for  Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium,  while it were  44.29, 50.33 and 42.49 respectively for  Pleurotus ostreatus  after the same 
incubation period of 72 hours . 
 The differences in the dye decolorization capacity have been related to fungal variations, the molecular 
complexity of dyes as well as  culture conditions (Levin et al., 2004 and Machado et al., 2006) . The differences 
in the decolorization characteristics for the individual dyes are attributed to the dissimilarity in  specificities, 
structures and complexity, particularly on the nature and position of subsistent in the aromatic rings and the 
resulting interactions with the azo bond of different dyes as reported by many authors (Eichlerova, 2006; 
Vijaykumar et al., 2007) .  
 However, Pleurotus ostreatus , and Phanerochaete chrysosporium were selected for treatment by UV light 
to improve their ability to decolorize some textile dyes compared to its original strain.

2. Pleurotus ostreatus  mutagenesis:     
 
 Table ( 4) showed effect of UV light on the survival frequency of  P. ostreatus  protoplasts.  Results sh owed 
that when  protoplast suspension of  Pleurotus ostreatus  was exposed to UV -light for 30, 45 and 60 seconds, 
survival percentages rapidly decreas ed by increasing exposure time  and were 28.8 and 7.6 after 30 and 45 
seconds , respectively ,  as well as it dropped down to zero percent after 60 seconds. This may be due to 
sensitivity of the protoplasts to UV.  The prolonged incubation causes uncontrolled DNA damage which results 
in cell death. A suitable incubation limit for good mutagenesis to occur can be determined by selection process (Gopinath et al., 2009) .

 However, in some non- sporulating filamento us fungi, protoplasts are a suitable starting material for 
mutag enesis ( Joh et al., 2004) . Vijaya et al., (2009)  obtained mutant strains of Pleurotus ostreatus  with the 
objective of enhancing their ligninolytic activity  after exposure  of mycelium growing in agar plates to UV light 
for 10, 20, 30 40, 50 and 60 minutes.  
 
3. Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  mutagenesis:     
 
 The dose -response analysis for the UV mutagenesis of  Phanerochaete   chrysosporium  was done and the 
percent of survival values are shown in Table 4. The dosage was expressed in terms of time of exposure to the 
UV light and varied in the range 30 -120 sec. to analyze the survival capacity and mutation effect .  
 Data   presented in Table ( 4) showed that 148, 36 and 13 colonies were recovered aft er UV treatment for 
30, 60 and 90 second,  respectively. No colony development was observed after 120 sec. Cell death may be due 
to the penetration of UV light through the cell membrane and destruction of intracellular organelles, which result in protein structure damage. The occurrence of damage to the DNA depends on the probability of the 
exposure of UV light and sometimes this may not happen due to high cellular density (Gopinath et al. , 2009) . 
 However, many investigators (Homolka et al., 1995; Cacchio e t al., 2003)  used UV mutagenesis to improve 
enzymatic activities in white rot fungi.  Other research groups have been successful in obtaining Trichoderma 
mutants by means of UV -mutagenesis (Szekeres et al., 2004; Hatvani et al., 2006; Besoain et al., 2007) . 5854

4. Decolorization efficiency of UV mutants:  
 Mutants obtained through random mutagenesis approach using UV light were employed for dye 
decolorization. Potential strains were selected based on their decolorization ability compared to parental wild type st rain.  
 5. Analysis of UV  mutants according to dye decolorization:   
  The frequency analysis of 30 mutants obtained from UV mutagenesis are presented in Table ( 5). The 
mutants showed decolorization percentages   more than the value obtained for wild type s train, were considered 
as positive mutants.  
 Data presented in Table ( 5) and Fig . (1) showed the positive and negative Pleurotus ostreatus  mutants. The 
largest numbers of positive mutants were recorded after  Acid fast red and Disperse violet 31 decolorizat ion 
along with all incubation periods (Fig. 1). Moreover, incubation period of 48 hours is more suitable for Methyl 
orange (18 mutants), Acid fast red (24) and Disperse violet 31(28) while 72 hours of incubation enhanced 
Reactive black 5 (16), Congo red (1 6) and Methylene blue (17) . It is surprising to notice from Table ( 5) that the 
same numbers of positive mutants, i.e.  16 mutants were obtained after incubation with Congo red,  Reactive 
Black 5, Acid fast red and Methyl orange for 72 hours.  
 Decolorization of Disperse violet 31 and Reactive black 5 dyes by Pleurotus ostreatus  mutants in 
comparison with the original strain was presented in Fig.(2).  These dyes are used widely in the textile  industries.

Fig. 2: Decolo rization of two various textile dyes by Pleurotus ostreatus mutants  in comparison with the 
original strain  and control . The tested dyes were as follows: (A) Disperse violet 31 (B) Reactive black  5.  
  On the other hand, Data presented in Table ( 5) and Fig.  (3) showed the positive and negative 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  mutants on dye removal. The largest number of negative mutants (30 mutants) 
was obtained   after incubation with Reactive Black 5 at all incubation periods followed by Disperse violet 31 
since only one positive  mutant obtained after 24 hours. Concerning Congo red  decolorization , 14, 16 and 13 
mutants  exhibited positive effect  after 24, 48 and 72 hours , respectively , while 13, 10 and 6 positive mutants 
were obtained after the same incubatio n periods with Methyl  orange dye.  
 In general, it can be concluded that, Pleurotus  ostreatus mutants showed higher decolorization values 
compared to  Phanerochaete chrysosporium.  However, development of positive or negative mutants may be due 
to secretion o f some enzymes responsible for decolorization. Due to the mutagenesis, some enzymes were 
suppressed, whereas certain enzymes production was stimulated (Gopinath et al., 2009) .   
 Anyhow, random mutagenesis is used to induce mutation in organisms for better  distinctiveness (Kamath et 
al., 2008) . Improvement of the microbial strain by subjecting the genetic material to physical and chemical 
mutagenic agents offers furthermost opportunity for cost reduction without significant capital outlay (Lotfy et 
al., 200 7). However, since various levels of positive mutants were observed, the higher order mutants were 
selected for further protoplast fusion studies.
