Email n.kieviet@slaz.n lAbstract:  Infants are at risk of developing symptoms of Poor Neonatal Adaptation (PNA) after 
exposure to psychotropic drugs in utero. Such symptoms are largely similar after exposure to 
antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines and consist of mostly mild neurologic, 
autonomic, respirator and gastro-intestinal abnormalities. Most symptoms develop within 
48 hours after birth and last for 2–6 days. After exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake 
Inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine or venlafaxine in utero, breastfeeding is presumably protective 
for development of PNA. The dosage of antidepressants does not seem to be related to the risk 
of PNA. In order to objectify possible symptoms of PNA, observation of mother and child 
at the maternity ward is advisable. If PNA symptoms do not occur, an observation period of 
48–72 hours is sufficient. This applies to all types of psychotropic drugs. When PNA symptoms 
are present it is advisable to observe the infant until the symptoms are fully resolved. Observa -
tion can be performed by trained nurses using the Finnegan scoring list. This observation list 
should be administered every 8 hours. Interpretation of the scores should be carried out by a 
paediatrician. In most cases symptoms are non-specific. Therefore other diagnoses, such as 
infection or neurologic problems, have to be excluded. When there is any doubt on possible 
intoxications during pregnancy, toxicological urine screening is indicated. Most cases of PNA 
are mild, of short duration and self-limiting without need for treatment. Supporting measures 
such as frequent small feedings, swaddling and increase of skin to skin contact with the mother 
is usually sufficient. In case of severe PNA it is advised to admit the infant to the Neonatal Care 
Unit (NCU). Phenobarbital is a safe therapeutic option. There seem to be no major long term 
effects; however, additional studies are necessary in order to draw definite conclusions.

Introduction
For women with a known psychiatric disorder, pregnancy and the first six months after 
delivery are a vulnerable period, in which psychiatric disorders may relapse or worsen. 
Of all pregnant women, approximately 15% have psychiatric problems, in particular 
depression and anxiety.1,2
The possible negative effects of untreated psychiatric symptoms to mother and child 
have to be weighed against the possible negative effects of psychotropic medication 
use during pregnancy, in order to diminish maternal and neonatal complications both 
during and after pregnancy.
Untreated psychiatric disorders during pregnancy may lead to three major 
complications. Firstly, it can lead to pregnancy complications, such as low birth weight 
and prematurity, which is partly due to maternal stress related elevated cortisol levels.3–6 Dove press

http: //dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT .S3639 4Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9Secondly, maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety 
may lead to irritation, agitation, lethargy, and less alertness, 
as well as poverty of facial expressions in infants.6–8 Lastly, 
maternal psychiatric symptoms can lead to attachment prob -
lems between mother and child, which are a risk factor for 
learning and behavioural problems later in life.9–11
The possible risks of psychotropic drug use during preg -
nancy, such as malformations, pregnancy complications, Poor 
Neonatal Adaptation (PNA), and long term effects should 
be carefully weighed against the benefits. In daily practice 
the use of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy increases 
gradually. Approximately 3.5% of all pregnant women in the 
Western world use psychotropic drugs during pregnancy.12
To assist the decision process regarding the treatment of 
psychiatric disorders during pregnancy many guidelines have 
been developed and reviews have been written.13–15 However, 
these writings mainly focus on the risk of malformations and 
do not provide recommendations regarding observation and 
treatment of PNA. Therefore, this article focuses on PNA in 
infants exposed to the most commonly used psychotropic 
drugs in utero; antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabi -
lisers and benzodiazepines, and can serve as a guideline for 
observation of infants exposed to these psychotropic drugs 
in utero.
Etiology
Symptoms of PNA are caused by exposure to psychotropic 
drugs. However, the exact etiology is not fully understood. 
There are three possible explanations. First of all, symptoms 
may be caused by withdrawal of psychotropic drugs. 
In adults, psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, 
antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, may result in 
withdrawal symptoms when not gradually tapered.16,17 
Since all psychotropic drugs pass the placenta,18–20 abrupt 
discontinuation of drug exposure after birth can lead to 
symptoms of withdrawal in infants resembling symptoms of 
withdrawal in adults. Symptoms include feeding difficulties, 
irritability and tremors.21,22 Most symptoms do not develop 
until eight hours after birth23–25 and proceed even though 
medication exposure has ceased, which is a typical symptom 
of withdrawal.23,24,26 In most cases of withdrawal, plasma 
concentrations of psychotropic drugs are low.20,22,23,25,27
Another cause of the symptoms is drug toxicity28,29 which 
is a known, although rare, phenomenon in adults. Symptoms of 
drug toxicity are partly similar to symptoms of withdrawal, such 
as jitteriness and hyperreflexia. However, symptoms of toxic -
ity develop directly after birth.21,22,29 In most cases of toxicity, 
plasma concentrations of psychotropic drugs are high.29–31It can be difficult to distinguish withdrawal of toxicity, 
since symptoms of withdrawal and toxicity are largely 
similar. Therefore many investigators postulate that a 
combination of withdrawal and toxicity is possible.23,24,32–35 
Since there is no consensus, multiple terms are used, such 
as poor neonatal adaptation, neonatal behavioural syndrome, 
postnatal adaptation syndrome/symptoms, transient neonatal 
symptoms, neonatal effects, neonatal complications, and 
neonatal abstinence syndrome.22,23,35,36 Table  1 presents 
characteristics of toxicity and withdrawal after exposure to 
psychotropic drugs in utero.
Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that psychotropic 
drugs may act as intrauterine stressors. This stress can initi -
ate alterations in fetal programming and development that 
might produce alterations in the child’ s behaviour at any age, 
a phenomenon known in cocaine exposed infants.37
Apart from exposure to psychotropic medication in 
utero, other factors, such as depression and anxiety of the 
mother,7,8,36–39 genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors 
can also lead to symptoms of restlessness in infants.6,33,35,37,40 
This multifactorial origin can also explain the variability 
of PNA symptoms in infants.36,37 Thereafter, infants have a 
limited repertoire of nonspecific activities. This can make it 
difficult to distinguish PNA from other syndromes such as 
infection.

1258Kieviet et alNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9Symptoms
PNA consists of neurologic, autonomic, respirator, and 
gastro-intestinal symptoms, which are largely similar after 
exposure to antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiaz -
epines ( Table  2).5,13,16,17,19,21–28,33,35,36,40–64
In most infants symptoms are mild, such as sleep 
disturbances. Severe symptoms, such as convulsions, 
are rare.23,24
This review presents a resume of the most recent 
literature on PNA after exposure to the most commonly used 
psychotropic drugs in utero.
Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors
The use of SSRIs during pregnancy has increased during the 
last few years, as knowledge has grown of the consequences 
of such use. Nowadays, 1.8%–2.8% of all pregnant women 
use an SSRI during pregnancy.24,65–67
Of all infants exposed to an SSRI in utero, 20%–77% 
develop symptoms of PNA, although most studies reported 
percentages around 30%.24,26,27,35,36,42,45,68 Some studies 
described an increased incidence of PNA after exposure to 
paroxetine and fluoxetine compared to other SSRIs,16,23,34,53,69 
though other studies did not find this association.17,70
The half-life of the SSRI seems to influence the risk 
of withdrawal and toxicity; SSRIs with a short half-life, 
such as paroxetine, cause more withdrawal, however less 
toxicity, compared to SSRIs with a long half-life, such 
as fluoxetine.16,22,23,69,71 However, after exposure to SSRIs 
with a long half-life, withdrawal is more common than 
toxicity.
Most symptoms develop within 48  hours after birth and last 
for 2–6 days.24,27,42 If PNA symptoms do not occur in the first 
48 hours after birth, development of PNA is unlikely.26,45Some studies5,42,72,77 showed an increased risk of 
hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia. However, evidence is 
limited and there are no published recommendations on whether 
routine glucose measurements are indicated.5,22,24,42,48,72,73 
There is conflicting clinical evidence regarding an elevated 
risk of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn 
(PPHN) after exposure to SSRIs. The absolute risk cannot 
be determined, but is very small, probably less than 1%.74 
The FDA advises to treat depression during pregnancy as 
clinically appropriate since there is not sufficient evidence to 
conclude that SSRI use in pregnancy cause PPHN. Therefore 
discontinuation, lowering the dose or switching to another 
type of antidepressant is not recommended.75
Tricyclic Antidepressants
Of all infants exposed to Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) 
in utero, 20%–50% develops PNA.76
Symptoms of PNA after exposure to TCAs are similar 
to symptoms after exposure to SSRIs ( Table  2).13,19,72,77 
Most symptoms develop within 48 hours of birth and last 
for 2–6 days.61
Apart from PNA, anticholinergic symptoms such as urine 
retention and obstipation have been described in two case 
reports. However, these symptoms are rare.19,77,78
Other types of antidepressants
Other allowed and frequently used antidepressants during 
pregnancy are venlafaxine, a Serotonin Norepinephrine 
Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI), bupropion, an atypical 
antidepressant, and mirtazapine, a Noradrenergic and Specific 
Serotonergic Antidepressant (NaSSA). After exposure 
to venlafaxine the risk of PNA seems to be comparable 
to the risk after exposure to SSRIs.79,80 After exposure to 
mirtazapine PNA is described in one case report.46 There 
are no reports describing PNA after exposure to bupropion. 
Data on infants exposed to mirtazapine or bupropion without 
symptoms of PNA are not published.
Antipsychotics
Antipsychotics are defined as first generation antipsychot -
ics, also called typical antipsychotics and second generation 
antipsychotics, also called atypical antipsychotics.
Literature on PNA after exposure to first and second 
generation antipsychotics is limited. However, there is 
evidence that exposure to both generation antipsychotics can 
lead to symptoms of PNA ( Table  2).19,37,50,58,81,82 Numbers on 
the incidence of PNA after exposure to antipsychotics are 
lacking.Table 2  Symptoms of PNA in infants exposed to antidepressants,

1259Neonatal withdrawal after exposure to psychotropic drugsNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as increased muscle 
tone, tremors, hyperactivity, agitation, dystonia, decreased 
sucking reflex, motor restlessness, abnormal movements 
and primitive reflexes, can also occur.44,50,58–61,82 Most 
symptoms develop within 48 hours of birth and last for 
2–6 days.19,50
Mood stabilisers
Lithium is the most commonly prescribed mood stabiliser 
during pregnancy.83 The most often described syndrome after 
intrauterine exposure to lithium is the floppy infant syndrome, 
which develops directly after birth. This syndrome consists 
of symptoms such as hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory 
depression, cyanosis, arrhythmias and decrease sucking 
reflex.19,57,58,60–62,83–86 Although exact figures on incidence are 
lacking, the incidence is suggested to be low.83 Other described 
lithium related symptoms are neonatal thyroid toxicity, 
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cardiovascular and renal 
dysfunctions, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatotoxicity and PPHN. 
These symptoms are generally self-limiting.57,59,60,62,83,86 Most 
symptoms develop within one day and disappear in 2–10 days 
after birth.62,87 However, based on literature and our clinical 
experience, most infants do not show any symptoms.83,86 
Some authors advise to monitor lithium serum levels, thyroid 
levels, urea and electrolytes in the infant.84 Since symptoms 
are rare and self-limiting we do not advise routine additional 
testing.
A higher serum lithium concentration ( .0.64 meq/liter)  
leads to an increased risk of obstetric and neonatal 
complications.18 Therefore, it is advised to discontinue 
lithium when the pregnancy is in the state of regular 
contractions (in partu), and re-instate lithium directly post-
delivery.18,82 Since the floppy infant syndrome develops 
directly after birth and is dose related, it is clearly related 
to lithium toxicity ( Table  1). However, symptoms can also 
occur in combination with low maternal or neonatal serum 
levels of lithium,62,83,86 suggesting that some infants are 
more vulnerable to develop symptoms of toxicity compared 
to others. Unfortunately, evidence is too limited to draw 
conclusions on the exact etiology.83
Since lithium is the mood stabiliser most prescribed dur -
ing pregnancy,83 other mood stabilisers are less frequently 
used and therefore also less frequently studied. After exposure 
to lamotrigine, PNA symptoms, such as decreased muscle 
tone and sedation, are described.58 The moment of onset and 
duration are not described.
Other commonly used mood stabilisers are valproic 
acid and carbamazepine. However, these drugs are not recommended during pregnancy since there is an elevated 
risk of malformations and long term complications after 
exposure to these drugs in utero.
Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed during pregnancy. 
Approximately 3% of all pregnant women uses this type of 
medication.12 After exposure to benzodiazepines during the 
last trimester of pregnancy, infants may develop symptoms of 
the floppy infant syndrome, as well as PNA, which can also 
merge into each other.19,43,54,58,60–62,88 Figures on the incidence 
of both syndromes are not available.
Factors which influence the development of neonatal 
symptoms include the pharmacokinetic properties of the 
benzodiazepine, degree of placental passage, duration of 
drug ingestion, dose, moment of last drug ingestion and 
metabolism and excretion by the infant.58,89 The floppy 
infant syndrome is most likely due to benzodiazepine 
toxicity. High medication dosages (equivalent of diaz -
epam .30 mg) in combination with benzodiazepines 
with a long half-life, such as nitrazepam and diazepam, 
give the highest risk, since this leads to accumulation in 
infants ( Table  1).54,58,61,89 Benzodiazepines with a short 
half-life, such as oxazepam and temazepam, do not lead to 
toxicity in most cases. However, the risk of withdrawal is 
increased compared to benzodiazepines with a long half-
life ( Table  1).54,89 Symptoms of the floppy infant syndrome 
develop directly after birth and can persist for hours to 
days. Symptoms of PNA mostly develop within hours after 
birth and can persist for months.54,62,89 Since the floppy 
infant syndrome can cause severe morbidity, prescription 
of benzodiazepines in the last trimester of pregnancy is 
not recommended.
Influential factors
Some infants develop symptoms of PNA while others do not. 
There is limited evidence on factors that create vulnerability 
to develop PNA. In the next section we will discuss existing 
literature on possible influencing factors of PNA.
Prematurity
One study described an increased risk of PNA in premature 
infants, arguing that these infants show more lung and 
central nervous system immaturity.42 Another study did 
not find this relationship.70 Some authors hypothesised 
that prematurity can also be protective for PNA, since 
this has also been observed in infants exposed to illicit 
drugs.23,32
submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.co m
Dove press Dove press
1260Kieviet et alNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9intoxications
Use of alcohol, nicotine and illicit drugs during pregnancy 
can also cause PNA.32,90 Based on our experience there is an 
increased risk of PNA after exposure to these substances in 
combination with psychotropic drugs. However, literature on 
the combination of respectively alcohol and illicit drugs with 
psychotropic drugs is lacking. Although smoking can lead to 
withdrawal symptoms,90 studies which examined the effect of 
smoking on PNA after exposure to psychotropic drugs con -
cluded that smoking did not elevate the risk of PNA.42,70,91,92
Exposure to multiple psychotropic drugs
Only one study examined whether the risk of PNA 
increased after exposure to multiple psychotropic drugs. 
Infants exposed to paroxetine combined with clonazepam 
revealed more PNA symptoms compared to infants exposed 
to monotherapy of SSRIs during the last trimester of 
pregnancy.27 In conclusion, an association between the use of 
multiple psychotropic drugs and PNA is plausible. However, 
additional research is necessary in order to investigate this 
possible association.
Dosage
After exposure to lithium and benzodiazepines, a relation 
between maternal dosage and PNA symptoms has been 
described.18,27,93 Literature is inconclusive regarding 
SSRIs.17,26,27,39 However, an observational study in 247  infants 
exposed to SSRIs, mirtazapine or venlafaxine, performed 
by our research group, concluded that there was no relation 
between the risk of PNA and dosage.
One study investigated the relation between the plasma 
concentration of clomipramine and symptoms of PNA and 
showed a weak correlation.41 The relation between PNA 
and the dosage of other psychotropic drugs has not been 
published.
Timing and duration of exposure
One study described that infants exposed to SSRIs during 
the last two weeks of pregnancy have the same incidence of 
PNA compared to infants not exposed to SSRIs during this 
period. The authors postulate that some adverse neonatal 
outcomes may not be the result of an acute pharmacological 
condition such as toxicity or withdrawal.94 A second study 
by the same study group showed that in contrast to timing, 
duration of SSRI exposure was significantly correlated with 
poor neonatal outcomes.39
With regard to lithium, the timing of the last dosage does 
influence the perinatal outcome (as described earlier).Type of feeding
A study of infants exposed to clomipramine did not reveal a 
relation between PNA and type of feeding.41 However, two 
studies in infants exposed to opioids in utero showed that 
breastfed infants developed less PNA compared to formula 
fed infants.95,96 The previously mentioned observational 
study of our research group concluded that breastfeeding 
is protective for PNA in 247  infants exposed to SSRIs, 
mirtazapine or venlafaxine in utero. This finding can be 
explained by the excretion of small amounts of psychotropic 
drugs into the breast milk, which might lead to a slower 
decrease and therefore to less symptoms of PNA.17,97 Another 
possible explanation is the increase of skin to skin contact 
during breastfeeding.
Maternal psychiatric symptoms
Depression or anxiety during and after pregnancy may lead 
to irritation, inconsolable crying and decreased activity in 
infants.7,8,36–39 Two studies examined the relation between 
the amount of depressive symptoms and PNA, though results 
were conflicting.70,91
Genetic factors
Regarding SSRIs, an interaction between genetic factors 
and environment probably influences the occurrence of 
PNA.27,48,52,98
Fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline are metabolised 
by CYP450 2D6.27 Therefore, in mothers with a deficiency 
of this cytochrome (also called poor metabolizers), plasma 
concentrations of these SSRIs are elevated which can increase 
the risk of toxicity in the infant.27,48
Furthermore, polymorphism in the promoter region of 
the serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4, leads to differen -
tial gene expression, and consequent differences in clinical 
effects of SSRIs in adults and infants.48,98
Observation of PNA
In order to objectify possible symptoms of PNA, standardised 
observation of mother and child at the maternity ward is 
preferred. Admission at the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU) is 
not necessary since PNA is mostly mild and admission at 
the maternity ward enhances attachment between mother 
and child. Only when PNA symptoms are severe, such as 
severe tremors or convulsions, admittance to the NCU is 
warranted.23
If PNA symptoms do not occur, an observation period of 
48–72 hours is sufficient.23,24,26,55,99 This applies to all types 
of psychotropic drugs. When PNA symptoms are present it 
submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.co m
Dove press Dove press
1261Neonatal withdrawal after exposure to psychotropic drugsNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2013:9is advisable to observe the infant until the PNA symptoms 
are fully resolved.100 A shorter observation period entails 
the risk of development of symptoms at home. Since the 
symptoms are nonspecific it is difficult to instruct parents. 
In addition, an infant with symptoms of restlessness with 
unknown origin can possibly provoke psychiatric symptoms, 
such as anxiety or depression in mothers with an existing 
psychiatric disorder.
Scoring system
To recognise, observe and objectify the development and 
progression of PNA, a scoring system is essential.37,101 
At present there is no validated scoring system for 
observation of PNA in infants exposed to psychotropic 
drugs in utero. However, the Finnegan scoring list is widely 
used as an observation tool for PNA, although this list 
was originally designed to assess PNA after exposure to  
opiates.23,24,26,32,37,55,76,102 The list consists of 21 symptoms with 
a point scale ranging from 0 to 5 for each item. A score of 4–7 
is indicative for mild symptoms of PNA and a score of 8 and 
above is considered to illustrate severe symptoms of PNA. 
Trained nurses administer the score every 8 hours. In case of a 
score of 8 or higher observation is increased to every 2 hours.24 
To enhance reliability it is important that nurses and doctors 
are trained in administrating the Finnegan scoring list. Since 
some symptoms, such as loose stools, are not specific for 
PNA, the score can be elevated in absence of PNA. For this 
reason interpretation of the score has to be carried out by the 
pediatrician on daily basis. In cases where the Finnegan score 
is 8 or higher, the pediatrician should be consulted.
Differential diagnosis and additional 
testing
Since infants have a limited repertoire of nonspecific activities, 
it can be difficult to distinguish between PNA and other 
neonatal syndromes. The differential diagnosis of PNA consists 
of infection, metabolic or neurologic problems, hyper viscosity, 
and excitation syndromes, such as small for gestational 
age.32,37,41 In case of debate on the origin of the presenting 
symptoms, these diagnoses have to be excluded. However, 
to prevent overmuch additional testing, it is important to 
observe infants by specialized caregivers in order to recognise 
PNA.17,22,24,32,37,42,69 The pediatrician evaluates the moment of 
onset of symptoms, the course and type of symptoms and 
examines the infant. When symptoms are present which are 
not typical for PNA, such as fever, or a nonspecific course 
of symptoms, such as symptoms that develop .48 hours 
postpartum, other diagnoses have to be excluded.Alcohol or illicit drug use during pregnancy can 
also cause PNA.32 When there is any doubt on possible 
intoxications during pregnancy, toxicological urine screening 
is indicated.55
Treatment
Most cases of PNA are mild, of short duration and self-
 limiting, without need for treatment.5,19,22,24,26,42,46,69 Supporting 
measures, such as frequent small feedings on demand, 
swaddling and increase of skin to skin contact with mother, 
leading to an improved temperature regulation, and more 
regular breathing, is mostly sufficient.5,19,24,26,37,42,46,69 When 
there is severe PNA and supporting measures are not 
sufficient, phenobarital is a safe, therapeutic option.22–24 
This symptomatic treatment is also used in cases of 
opiate withdrawal.22–24 Although there are no studies on 
Table 3  Recommendations regarding observation and treatment 
of Poor Neonatal Adaptation (PNA)
General recommendations
in otherwise healthy infants routine additional laboratory tests in order 
to exclude possible neonatal complications are not required.
Observation at the maternity ward is preferred. Only when PNA 
symptoms are severe, admittance to the Neonatal Care Unit is 
necessary.
Discourage the use of illicit drugs and alcohol since these substances 
also cause PNA.
An observation period of 48–72 hours is sufficient when no PNA 
symptoms occur.  
when PNA symptoms are present observe the infant until the PNA 
symptoms are fully resolved.
The Finnegan scoring list has to be administered every 8 hours by 
trained nurses.  
In case of a score of 8 or higher this has to be intensified to every 2 hours.  
interpretation of the score has to be carried out by the pediatrician.
in case of debate on the origin of presenting symptoms other diagnoses 
such as infection, metabolic or neurologic problems, hyper viscosity, and 
excitation syndromes like small for gestational age have to be excluded.
in case of any doubt on possible intoxications during pregnancy 
toxicological urine screening is indicated.
Supporting measures such as frequent small feedings on demand, 
swaddling and increase of skin to skin contact with mother is mostly 
sufficient.  
When there is severe PNA and supporting measures are not sufficient, 
phenobarital is a safe therapeutic option. when using the Finnegan 
scoring list 2 scores of 8 or higher in between 2 hours is an indication 
of pharmacotherapy.
Drug specific recommendations
After exposure to lithium during pregnancy, discontinue when the 
patient is in partu and re-instate directly post delivery.
The dosage of antidepressants seems not related to the risk of 
development of PNA. Therefore, lowering the dosage is not useful in 
order to prevent PNA.
Encourage breastfeeding after exposure to SSRis, mirtazapine or 
venlafaxine, since this probably reduces the risk of PNA.

in infants with irritation or convulsions is established and

of 8 or higher within a 2 hour period is an indication of 
pharmacotherapy at the NCU.24
Many parents have feelings of guilt when symptoms of 
PNA are present.37 It is important to be clear about the diag -
nosis on one hand, and explain the transitory, self-limiting 
course of the symptoms on the other.26,27 Table  3 presents 
recommendations regarding the observation and treatment 
of PNA.
Long term effects of PNA
The effect of PNA on the neurological development in 
children of 2–6 years is studied by Klinger.104 In this study 
30 infants with PNA, and 52  infants without PNA, all 
exposed to SSRIs, were followed. There was no significant 
difference in IQ, findings during neurological examination 
and total development score104 (measured by the Denver 
development test). The subscale ‘social behaviour’ was 
significantly lower in infants with PNA postpartum.104 
Oberlander assessed the development in children of 2 and 
8 months exposed to SSRI and clonazepam and noted no 
significant differences between infants with and without 
PNA.27 Additional research is necessary to examine the long 
terms effects of PNA.
Conclusion
After exposure to psychotropic drugs in utero infants are 
at risk to develop symptoms of PNA. Although there is 
debate on the exact etiology of PNA the most plausible 
explanation is withdrawal, toxicity, or a combination of both. 
Distinguishing PNA of toxicity is difficult since symptoms 
of PNA and toxicity are largely similar.
PNA consists of neurologic, autonomic, respirator 
and gastro-intestinal symptoms, which are largely 
similar after exposure of antidepressants, antipsychotics 
and benzodiazepines. In most infants symptoms are 
mild, such as sleep disturbances. Severe symptoms, 
such as convulsions, are rare. Of all infants exposed 
to antidepressants in utero, around 20%–50% develop 
symptoms of PNA. Figures on the incidence of PNA 
after exposure to antipsychotic drugs, mood stabilizers 
or benzodiazepines are lacking. Most symptoms of PNA 
develop within 48  hours and last for 2–6  days. However, 
after exposure to benzodiazepines, symptoms can persist 
for months. If symptoms do not occur in the first 48  hours, 
development of PNA is unlikely.Influential factors of PNA are scarcely studied. 
There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of 
prematurity and maternal psychiatric symptoms on PNA. 
After exposure to SSRIs, mirtazapine or venlafaxine 
in utero, breastfeeding is presumed to be protective 
for development of PNA. Furthermore, the dosage of 
antidepressants seems not to be related to the risk of PNA. 
Therefore, lowering the dosage of antidepressants is not 
useful in order to prevent PNA. This does not apply for 
benzodiazepines and lithium.
Observation on the maternity ward is preferred, since 
PNA is mostly mild and admission at the maternity ward 
enhances attachment between mother and child. Only 
when PNA symptoms are severe is admittance to the NCU 
necessary. If PNA symptoms do not occur, an observation 
period of 48–72 hours is sufficient. This applies to all types 
of psychotropic drugs. When PNA symptoms are present it 
is advisable to observe the infant until the PNA symptoms 
are fully resolved.
To observe and objectify the development and progression 
of PNA a scoring system is essential. The Finnegan scoring 
list has to be administered every 8 hours by trained nurses. 
In case of a score of 8 or higher this has to be intensified to 
every 2 hours. Since the Finnegan scoring list lacks speci -
ficity, interpretation of the score should be carried out by a 
pediatrician.
Since infants have a limited repertoire of nonspecific 
activities, it can be difficult to differentiate between PNA 
and other neonatal syndromes. The differential diagnosis 
of PNA consists of infection, metabolic of neurologic 
problems, hyper viscosity, and excitation syndromes 
such as small for gestational age. In case of debate on the 
origin of presenting symptoms these diagnoses have to be 
excluded. When there is any doubt on possible intoxica -
tions during pregnancy, toxicological urine screening is 
indicated.
Most cases of PNA are mild, of short duration and self-
limiting without need for treatment. Supporting measures 
such as frequent, small feedings on demand, swaddling 
and increased skin to skin contact with mother, leading 
to an improved temperature regulation and a more regular 
breathing, is usually sufficient. When there is severe PNA 
and supporting measures are not sufficient, phenobarital is 
a safe therapeutic option. When using the Finnegan scoring 
list 2 scores of 8 or higher within 2 hours is an indication 
of pharmacotherapy.
Long term effects of PNA are examined in two studies.27,104
