An estimated 15% or more of the cancer burden worldwide is attributable to known infectious agents. We screened
colorectal carcinoma and matched normal tissue specimens using RNA-seq followed by host sequence subtraction and
found marked over-representation of Fusobacterium nucleatum sequences in tumors relative to control specimens. F. nucleatum
is an invasive anaerobe that has been linked previously to periodontitis and appendicitis, but not to cancer. Fusobacteria are
rare constituents of the fecal microbiota, but have been cultured previously from biopsies of inflamed gut mucosa. We
obtained a Fusobacterium isolate from a frozen tumor specimen; this showed highest sequence similarity to a known gut mucosa
isolate and was confirmed to be invasive. We verified overabundance of Fusobacterium sequences in tumor versus matched
normal control tissue by quantitative PCR analysis from a total of 99 subjects ( p=2.5310–6), and we observed a positive
association with lymph node metastasis.

Few infectious agents have been unequivocally linked to cancer.
Those that have, such as Human Papilloma Virus, Hepatitis B and C
virus, and Helicobacter pylori , alone are responsible for an estimated
15% of the global cancer burden, based on strength of the associa-tion and prevalence of infection (Parkin 2006). Metagenomics
methods developed over the past decade (Weber et al. 2002; Moore
et al. 2011) provide a useful approach to identifying microbial se-
quence signatures in diseases that have a possible or suspected in-
fectious etiology. There are variations on the method, but the basic
approach involves shotgun sequencing bulk DNA or RNA isolatedfrom disease tissue, computational subtraction of all sequence reads
recognized as human, and comparison of the residual reads to da-
tabases of known microbial sequences in order to identify microbial
species present in the initial specimen. The method is complemen-
tary to traditional culture and histolology–based protocols, and new
massively parallel sequencing technologies impart high sensitivity.
At present the power of the method remains restricted by the con-
tent of microbial sequence databases, but with our increasing reach
into microbial sequence space, the comprehensiveness of these data
resources continues to improve. In oncology, the identification of
a novel polyomavirus in Merkel Cell carcinoma (Feng et al. 2008) is
a recent demonstration of the utility of a metagenomics approach.
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of
cancer deaths, responsible for approximately 610,000 deaths per
year worldwide (World Health Organization 2011). It is also one of
the first and best genetically characterized cancers, and specific
somatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes havebeen found that are associated with progression from adenoma-tous lesions (polyps) to invasive carcinoma (Vogelstein et al. 1988).
The root cause of CRC is unclear, but inflammation is a well-rec-
ognized risk factor (Wu et al. 2009; McLean et al. 2011). Given the
link between H. pylori –mediated inflammation and gastric cancer
(Marshall and Warren 1984), we asked if inflammatory microor-ganisms are associated with other gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. We
began to address this question by undertaking a metagenomic
survey of colorectal carcinoma.
Results
Total RNA was isolated from frozen sections of 11 matched pairs ofcolorectal carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue specimens. RNA
was purified by host ribosomal sequence depletion, rather than
poly(A) selection, in order to retain non-polyadenylated sequences
of potential microbial origin. In our screen, we analyzed RNA
rather than DNA in order to detect active, transcribing microor-
ganisms and to allow for the detection of RNA viruses that may be
present. Illumina RNA-seq libraries were constructed, barcoded,
and pooled, and two lanes of paired-end sequencing data were
obtained using the Illumina GAIIx platform. Reads were filtered for
base quality and low complexity, then aligned pairwise to human
rRNA and cDNA (Flicek et al. 2011) and genome (hg18) reference
sequences using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin
2010), as previously described (Moore et al. 2011). Aligned reads were
removed from the data set, leaving 34.9 million pairs (Supplemental
Table S1). These residual read-pairs were then used to search a custom
database containing accessions for all RefSeq bacterial and viral ge-
nomes, using Novoalign (http://novocraft.com), which is a slower
but more permissive aligner than BWA. Our analysis was alignment-
based, because the abundance of candidate organisms can be inferred
more directly from alignments than from de novo assemblies. For
accuracy, we tallied only unambiguous alignments where the best6These authors contributed equally to this work.

genome accession. These alignments identified a total of 670 distinct
genome accessions, representing 415 species (Supplemental Table
S1). These were predominantly (97%) bacterial, although several
herpes virus sequences were detectable at low levels, and one tumor
showed over-abundance (142 raw read-pairs) of human papilloma-
virus type 107 (GenBank accession EF422221.1). A wide distribution
of bacterial species abundance was apparent, with 30 species repre-
senting 95% of the sequence data (Supplemental Fig. S1). Of the 670
distinct genome accessions hit, 63% were found in both tumor and
normal specimens. Alignments specific to only tumor or only
control specimens were due to rare sequences, and, therefore, the
representation in one group or the other may simply reflect sam-
pling bias. The only alignments we obtained that were markedly
disproportionate between tumor and control were to the genome of
Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum (American Type Culture
Collection [ATCC] 25586), a Gram-negative anaerobe. F. nucleatum
was the organism with the highest number of hits overall (21% of all
alignments), and nine of the 11 subjects showed at least twofold
higher read counts in tumor relative to corresponding control tissue
(Fig. 1). Differential abundance ranged from 0.1-fold to 256-fold,
with a mean over-abundance of 79-fold. The majority of the hitswere to highly abundant F. nucleatum ribosomal transcripts, but
other non-ribosomal F. nucleatum gene products were also detected
(Supplemental Fig. S2).
To explore further the observation of disparate F. nucleatum
read counts between tumor and matched normal samples in our RNA-seq data set, we developed a targete d quantitative real-time poly-
m e r a s ec h a i nr e a c t i o n( q P C R )a s s a yt oi n t e r r o g a t ea d d i t i o n a ls a m p l e s .To design the qPCR primers and probe, we gathered the 51,677 read-
pairs from tumor sample 1 that matched F. nucleatum and performed
a local de novo assembly using SSAKE (Warren et al. 2007) to obtain861 total contigs, ranging in length from 100 to 1433 bp. The ma-
jority of these contigs matched genes encoding F. nucleatum ribo-
somal RNAs and proteins, but we also obtained 82 contigs that gaveBLASTN (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) alignments of 80% or
greater sequence identity to other F. nucleatum protein-coding genes.
A 161-bp contig that returned a high-quality BLAST match (95%identity) to the nusG gene (GenBank accession AAL94126.1) of F.
nucleatum and no match to any gene of any other species, was used as
the target for designing a qPCR (Taq man, ABI) primer /probe set. The
initial metagenomics screen described above involved interrogationof expressed genes; however, once we established F. nucleatum as
a candidate pathogen, we switched to analysis of gDNA because

were normalized according to sequencing depth for both tumor and matched normal samples. The abundance of normalized bacterial read-pairs ranged
from zero to a maximum of 66,896 represented by a transition from green to red on a log 10scale. F. nucleatum sequences were present in the tumor
samples at levels twofold or greater than in normal samples in nine out of the 11 subjects. The mean over abundance across all subjects was 79-fold.

the frozen tissue sections. We conducted qPCR on gDNA isolated
from an additional 88 colorectal carcinomas and matched normal
specimens and confirmed an over-representation of F. nucleatum in
tumor versus matched normal specimens ( p=2.5310/C06, two-
tailed ratio t-test) (Fig. 2). The Fusobacterium abundance measured
by qPCR correlated with that measured from the RNA-seq data(Pearson’s r=0.97). The mean overall abundance of Fusobacterium
was found to be 415 times greater in the tumor samples ( n=99) than
in the matched normal samples ( n=99) (Fig. 2).
We attempted to culture Fusobacteria anaerobically, directly
from 12 of the frozen tumor sections that showed high abundance
by qPCR, and we obtained a single isolate (CC53). We purified
high-molecular-weight (HMW) gDNA from this culture, constructed
and sequenced a WGS (whole-genome shotgun) library using the
Illumina HiSeq platform, and obtained an excessive number
(64,819,156) of quality filtered, paired 100-nt reads. These reads
were aligned to the F. nucleatum type strain ATCC 25586 (GenBank
accession NC_003454.1) sequence, covering 76% of this referencegenome with 2661-fold mean depth and 95.6% 62.0% (mean 6
SD) identity. Furthermore, we aligned reads from CC53 to 483additional draft genome sequences available from the Human
Microbiome Project (HMP) (Nelson et al. 2010) including 16 as-of-yet
incomplete Fusobacterium genomes. CC53 aligned with highest
identity to Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_36A2, covering 91.6% of the 12-
supercontig draft assembly with 99.5 61.2% (mean 6SD) sequence
identity. Three-way analysis among these strains using cross_matchSmith-Waterman alignments confirmed that CC53 is closest to
Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_36A2 (Fig. 3). Some notable differences were
apparent, however. We observed 19 segments from strain 3_1_36A2that were missing from CC53. The majority (156/206) of the pre-
dicted coding sequences (CDS) on these segments from strain
3_1_36A2 had unknown function, but there were numerous se-
quences indicative of prophage content, including genes encoding
putative helicase, integrase, re combinase, terminase, and top-
oisomerase activity (Supplemen tal Table S2). De novo assembly
of unmapped CC53 reads yielded 82 kb of sequence in 67 contigs
$500 nt. These contigs aligned with variable sequence identity to
one of the 16 Fusobacterium genome assemblies or the ATCC type
strain. BLASTX (Altschul et al. 1997) searches of GenBank-nr iden-
tified 99 coding sequences (Supplemental Table S3), the most re-
current of which was hemolysin, a bacterial endotoxin. Most,
however, had no predicted function (Supplemental Table S3). Al-
though we were able to culture Fusobacterium from only a single
tumor section, we used primer walking to interrogate an additionalfour samples where qPCR-predicted levels of Fusobacterium were
high. Sanger sequences from these amplicons comprised 68,694total base pairs and each aligned with highest sequence similarity
(93%–100%) to one of the various Fusobacterium draft genomes, al-
though we could not assign unambiguously a specific best matchingstrain to any of these samples, due perhaps to within-sample strain
heterogeneity.
We were interested to determine if CC53 would demonstrate
invasiveness in human colonic epithelial cells. We used immunoflu-
orescence and an antibody-based differential staining method, de-
scribed previously (Strauss et al. 2011), to measure invasion of cul-
tured colonic adenocarcinoma-2 (Caco-2) cells by the Fusobacterium
tumor isolate. We identified two previous Fusobacterium polyclonal
antibodies, one rabbit (EAV_AS1) and one rat (EAV_AS2), whichreacted positively to CC53. Caco-2 cells were grown on glass cov-

determined between tumor and matched normal biopsies in 99 subjects, using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The cycle threshold (Ct) values for the
normal samples had a Ct range of 25.5 to 40, and the Ct range for the tumor samples was between 21.4 and 40. The data shown are mean values from two
independent experiments. Fusobacterium load, as determined by qPCR, was found to be significantly higher in the tumor samples versus the matched
control samples (two-tailed ratio t-test, p=2.52310/C06).Fusobacterium in colorectal carcinoma

of 100:1), and then differentially stained with anti- Fusobacterium
antibodies conjugated to different fluorophores before and afterCaco-2 cell permeabilization. We confirmed the invasiveness of
CC53 in this model system (Fig. 4).
We explored clinical correlates of Fusobacterium overabundance
but did not observe any association with tumor stage, tumor site,
history of treatment, patient age, or survival. To explore histopa-
thological correlates, a hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) stained sec-
tion from a representative cross-section clinical block from each
tumor was scored for lymphocytic infiltrates, myeloid/neutrophil
infiltrates, circumferential involvement, and luminal or geo-graphic necrosis, and these scores were compared to Fusobacterium
relative abundance (tumor vs. control). Fusobacterium showed
higher relative abundance in tumors with >50% circumferential
involvement (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, p=0.0023). In addition,
we found that subjects with high-relative-abundance Fusobacterium
in tumor relative to matched control tissue were significantly morelikely to have regional lymph node metastases, as determined by
their TNM (tumor, node, metastases) scores (one-tailed Fisher’s ex-
act test, p=0.0035) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Specifically, lymph node
metastases were present in 29/39 patients in the high-abundanceFusobacterium group versus 26/58 in the low-abundance group.
Discussion
F. nucleatum is an invasive (Han et al. 2000; Swidsinski et al.
2011), adherent (Weiss et al. 2000), and pro-inflammatory(Krisanaprakornkit et al. 2000; Peyret-Lacombe et al. 2009) anaer-
obic bacterium. It is common in dental plaque (Bolstad et al. 1996;
Ximenez-Fyvie et al. 2000), and there is a well-established associ-ation between F. nucleatum and periodontitis (Signat et al. 2011).
Anecdotally, F. nucleatum has been found to cause cerebral ab-
scesses (Kai et al. 2008) and pericarditis (Han et al. 2003), and it isone of the Fusobacterium species responsible for Lemierre’s syn-
drome, a rare form of thrombophlebitis (Weeks et al. 2010). Morerecently, various Fusobacteria including F. nucleatum have been
implicated in acute appendicitis, where they have been found byimmunohistochemistry (IHC) as epithelial and submucosal in-
filtrates that correlate positively with severity of disease (Swidsinski
and Ismail 2011). Furthermore, when isolated from human in-
testinal biopsy material, F. nucleatum has been found to be more
readily culturable from patients with GI disease than healthy con-
trols, and the strains grown from inflamed biopsy tissue tend to
display a more invasive phenotype (Strauss et al. 2008, 2011).
Our observation of a highly significant over-representation
ofF. nucleatum in colorectal tumor specimens was largely un-
expected, given that it is generally regarded as an oral pathogen—itis not an abundant constituent of the normal gut microbiota (Qin
et al. 2010). A new report of rRNA sequences from a small number
of colorectal tumor and contro l samples (Marchesi et al. 2011)
highlighted a trend toward elevated Coriobacteria in tumors, but
the data were also suggestive of an abundance of Fusobacteria. We
are also aware of an independent report of Fusobacterium in co-
lorectal cancer copublished in this issue (Kostic et al. 2012). Thus,there is increasing evidence that Fusobacterium infection is common
in colorectal carcinoma, but it remains to be determined if there isany involvement of Fusobacterium in tumorogenesis. The presence
of this bacterium may simply represent an opportunistic infectionat an immuno-compromised site, but the possibility of a role in
tumor etiology, perhaps through pro-inflammatory mechanisms,
deserves further scrutiny. Analysis of colorectal carcinomas arising

consecutive Q30 bases) from Fusobacterium tumor isolate CC53 were assembled with SSAKE (v3.7, default options) into 379 contigs. The contigs were
aligned using cross_match (-minmatch 29 -minscore 59 -masklevel 101) to the complete F. nucleatum susb. nucleatum ATCC 25586 genome and,
independently, to the 12-contig HMP Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_36A2 assembly, respectively; and ordered/oriented based on the highest identity to the latter
sequence. Three-way cross_match (http://www.phrap.org) alignments between each Fusobacterium genome were performed and represented visually
using hive plots (http://www.hiveplot.com). For each, the top,left,a n d right axes are proportional to genome size and represent the Fusobacterium tumor
isolate CC53 (2.07 Mb), the HMP sp. 3_1_36A2 (2.25 Mb), and the ATCC 25586 type strain (2.17 Mb), in that order. Synteny between the isolates is
depicted by green and red links that show direct and inverted alignments, respectively. Sequence similarity and synteny is highest between CC53 and s p.
3_1_36A2, as evidenced by a greater density of high similarity sequence matches between them, relative to ATCC 25586, and shared patterns of inversio ns
compared to this reference strain. Three regions of sequences present in sp. 3_1_36A2 but absent from CC53 are apparent as conspicuous gaps on the sp.3_1_36A2 axis. Sequence segments unique to CC53 are not visible at this scale.Castellarin et al.

interest. Furthermore, since colorectal carcinoma typically arises
from earlier-stage adenomatous lesions (polyps), it would also be
useful to screen early-stage lesions for the presence of this bacteria in
a prospective study. In the present study, three of the 99 tumor
sections were composed entirely of the adenomatous component ofadenocarcinoma specimens. By qPCR, two out of these three hadvery high Fusobacterium content, and, in fact, one of these gave the
highest tumor normal ratio of all samples. This supports the notionthat a comprehensive study of early-stage lesions may help de-
termine whether Fusobacterium infection is related to the early stages
of tumor progression. If so, it may be an appropriate target for vac-cination and/or antimicrobial therapy. Finally, should an etiological
link prove to be absent, the highly significant association of F.
nucleatum with colorectal carcinoma may still be of clinical utility.
For example, it may be possible to exploit this association for
screening purposes. Although we did not find F. nucleatum tumor
abundance to be elevated in all subjects in the present study, we didnot characterize the fecal microbiota in these patients, and we have
not yet obtained data from healthy subjects to compare to our
findings from CRC patients. Further work of this nature may reveal
F. nucleatum –related biomarkers that are informative with respect
to CRC presence or CRC risk, although this remains entirelyspeculative at the present time. There is also renewed interest in
the potential utility of bacterial cancer therapy (Forbes 2010), an
approach that relies fundamentally on the availability of microbes
with natural tumor specificity.
Methods
Clinical specimens
For all cases, fresh CRC samples were obtained with informed
consent by the BC Cancer Agency Tumor Tissue Repository (BCCA-
TTR) (Watson 2010), which operates as a dedicated biobank withapproval from the University of British Columbia–British ColumbiaCancer Agency Research Ethics Board (BCCA REB). The BCCA-TTR
platform is governed by Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that
meet or exceed the recommendations of international best practice
guidelines for repositories (NCI Office of Biorepositories and Bio-specmen Research, NCI Best Practic es for Biospecimen Resources).
Specimens are handled with very close attention to maintainingintegrity and isolation. Overall average collection time (time fromremoval from surgical field to cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen) for
all colorectal cases in the BCCA-TTR is 31 min. For this study, bio-
specimens were held briefly at /C020°C during frozen sectioning, using
100% ethanol to clean the blade between all samples. Clinical-pathological and outcomes data w ere obtained from the BC Cancer
Agency clinical chart including tumor features reported according tothe American College of Pathologists criteria and the ‘‘Protocol forExamination of Specimens from Patients with Primary Carcinoma ofthe Colon and Rectum.’’ This included histological features in-
dicative of inflammatory and immune response (lymphoid and
myeloid cell infiltrates), which were assessed as none, mild–moder-ate, or marked using semiquantitative scoring as well as the percentarea of tumor involved by necrosis, by a pathologist in a representa-
tive tumor cross-section.
Metagenomic library construction and sequencing
Eleven colorectal tumor samples and 11 matched normal samples
were processed, as detailed previously (Moore et al. 2011), using anRNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN) to purify total RNA or an AllPrepDNA/RNA mini kit (QIAGEN) to purify both DNA and RNA. RNA
quality and concentration were assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer
2000 RNA Nanochips. Ribosomal RNAs were depleted from 1 mgo f
total RNA using the manufacturer’s protocol for the RiboMinusEukaryote Kit for RNA-seq (Invitrogen). Depletion was assessed
using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2000 RNA Nanochips. All samples were
found to have #10% residual ribosomal RNA contamination and

et al. 2010) for the construction of Illumina libraries, with the fol-
lowing modifications: Each paired-end library was PCR amplifiedfor 15 cycles using the standard Illumina PE1 PCR primer plus one of12 modified PE2 primers, each including a unique 6-base insertion
as an index sequence. Libraries prepared using indexed primers were
then combined in pools of 11 each (one tumor pool, one controlpool), gel-purified, and then sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx
platform. One lane of 75-bp paired-end sequence was obtained for
each of the two pools.
Bioinformatics analysis
Paired-end sequence reads from indexed tumor and adjacent
normal sample libraries were processed as described (Moore et al.
2011). Briefly, corresponding human RNA-seq libraries were alignedwith BWA (version 0.5.4 [sample -o 1000, default options]) (Li andDurbin 2010) sequentially against human rRNA, cDNA, and genome
reference sequences (Flicek et al. 2011). Pairs aligning logically or
containing reads having either an average base quality below phred
20 (Ewing et al. 1998), and/or more than 20 consecutive homo-polymeric bases were subtracted from the original data. Read-
pairs that remained unaligned to any of the human sequence da-
tabases were used to interrogate a c ustom-built sequence collection of
well-characterized bacterial and viral genes and genomes using
novoalign (version 2.05.20 [-o SAM -r A -R 0, default options]).
Alignments were run on a single 3-GHz 8-CPU Intel Xeon 64-bit 61-GB RAM computer running CentOS release 5.4. Multiplexed readsfrom the tumor and normal libraries were deconvoluted according to
sequence tags (i.e., barcodes), and the number of read-pairs that
mapped unambiguously to a single location were tallied for eachindexed sample and normalized against the sample read count. Ul-timately, read-pair count was repo rted for each GenBank accession in
our microbial genome database, sorted in decreasing order by thesum of unambiguous pairs, and Perl scripts were developed to minethese data. Read counts were graphically visualized first by clustering
common accession reads using UPGMA (Sokal and Michener 1958)
and then displayed as a heat map (log
10scale) using the Mayday
package (http://www-ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/mayday/wp/).
Quantitative PCR
A custom TaqMan primer/probe set was designed to amplifyF. nucleatum DNA that matched the contiguous sequence from the
WTSS experiment. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for Fusobacterium
were normalized to the amount of human biopsy gDNA in eachreaction by using a primer/probe set for the reference gene, prosta-glandin transporter (PGT), as previously described (Wilson et al.2006). The reaction efficiency for the Fusobacterium assay and the
PGT assay were found to be 97% and 98%, respectively. The folddifference (2
/C0DDCt)i nFusobacterium abundance in tumor versus
normal tissue was calculated by subtracting DCttumor from
DCtnormal , where DCt is the difference in threshold cycle number
for the test and reference assay. Isolated biopsy DNA was quantifiedby PicoGreen Assay (Invitrogen) on a Wallac Victor spectropho-tometer (Perkin Elmer). Each reaction contained 5 ng of DNA and
was assayed in duplicate in 20 mL reactions containing 1 3final
concentration TaqMan Universal Master Mix (ABI part number
4304437), 18 mM each primer, and 5 mM probe and took place in
a 384-well optical PCR plate. Amplification and detection of DNA
was performed with the ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems) using the following reaction conditions: 2min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °C and 1
min at 60 °C. Cycle thresholding was calculated using the auto-
mated settings for SDS 2.2 (Applied Biosystems). The primer andprobe sequences for each assay were as follows: Fusobacteria
forward primer, 5 9-CAACCATTACTTTAACTCTACCATGTTCA-3 9;
Fusobacteria reverse primer, 5 9-GTTGACTTTACAGAAGGAGATTA

using the same samples and methods as outlined above, for the
purpose of replication, and very similar results were obtained.
Fusobacterium culture
Frozen tumor sections were thawed and immediately placed into
500mL of pre-reduced phosphate-buffered saline, and the tissue
was agitated and gently broken up using a pipette fitted with
a sterile, wide-bore, plugged tip. One hundred milliliter aliquots ofthis suspension were directly spread onto pre-reduced fastidious
anaerobe agar (FAA) plates supplemented with 5% defibrinated
sheep blood (DSB), and incubated for 10 d in a humidified anaer-obe chamber (Ruskinn Bug Box). Plates were inspected every 2 d forgrowth, and all colonies were picked and streak-purified on further
pre-reduced FAA +5% DSB plates. Single colonies were examined
by phase microscopy using a Leica ICC
50microscope fitted with
a 1003oil immersion objective, looking for slender rods or needle-
shaped cells characteristic of F. nucleatum. gDNA was isolated from
positively identified isolates using a Maxwell 16 instrument with
cell DNA cartidges, and aliquots were used as template in PCR withprimers and conditions as described by Kim et al. (2004). A product
size of 495 nt confirmed that the isolate belonged to the Fuso-
bacterium genus, and a further PCR to partially amplify 16S rRNA
gene was performed using the same DNA template using primers
and conditions as defined by Ben-Dov et al. (2006). This product
was sent for Sanger sequence analysis to MWG Operon, and
obtained traces that confirmed F. nucleatum as the species. In total,
three clones of the isolated strain were obtained from the tumor
specimen from patient number 53, and named CC53 F, G, and H,
respectively. All strains were stored at /C080°C in cryoprotectant
media (12% [w/v] skim milk powder, 1% [v/v] dimethyl sulfoxide,and 1% [v/v] glycerol).
Primer walking
PCR primers were designed using primer 3.0 and the F. nucleatum
types strain (ATCC 25586) genome as reference. For PCR, 1 ng ofextracted gDNA was used as template, and Phusion polymerase
(NEB) and buffers were used for the PCR. Cycling conditions were
as follows: 2 min at 94 °C, then 30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 67 °C, and
30 sec at 72 °C for 30 cycles. PCR products were purified using
Ampure magnetic beads. Sequencing reactions were done using
BigDye 3.1, and reaction products were run on AB 3730xl. Phred
quality 30 trimmed sequences were used in a BLASTN alignment
against the HMP reference genome data, keeping the hit with thehighest sequence identity.
Whole-genome sequencing of a representative strain
Fusobacterium genomic DNA was sonicated, and size fractions be-
tween 175 and 200 bp and between 400 and 450 bp were isolatedfollowing PAGE. WGSS paired end Illumina libraries were prepared
from each size fraction as described previously with the following
modifications: The final PCR amplification was increased to 15 cyclesand contained the standard Illumina PE1 PCR primer and an indexed
PE2 primer as detailed above for RNA-seq library construction. A total
of 92.0 million paired 100-nt reads were obtained from a single laneCastellarin et al.

only pairs with an average base quality of Q30 or higher, 64.8 million
paired reads were aligned with novoal ign (http://www.novocraft.com)
( - oS A M- rA- R0 )o n t ot h e F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586
(GenBank accession NC_003454.1) and Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_36A2
genome sequences (HMP accessions GG698790-GG698801), re-spectively. Paired read alignments were processed using custom Perlscripts that tracked genome sequence coverage, depth of coverage,
and average sequence identity of mapped pairs. Annotation of strain
sp. 3_1_36A2 regions devoid of read alignments was performed byextracting the coordinates of alignment gaps 1 kb or larger andmining the HMP GenBank-format file for existing gene annotations
(http://www.hmpdacc.org/data_genomes.php). Reads that did not
align onto the sp. 3_1_36A2 genome assembly were quality-trimmedto only include those having 70 or more consecutive Q30 bases andassembled with SSAKE (v3.7 [-p 1 -m 20 -o 2 -r 0.7]) in 67 contigs
(mean size =1225 bp; max size =6018 bp; total bases =82,076 bp;
N
50=1359 bp). The contigs were annotated using BLASTX (v2.2.25),
reporting the best hit for each high-scoring pair and manuallyinspecting each alignment.
In a separate analysis, the 64.8 million paired quality control
(QC) reads were filtered further, leaving only sequences having 99
or 100 consecutive Q30 bases. This aggressive filter yielded ;32
million total reads, including 4.5 million paired and 22.9 millionunpaired reads, and assembled with SSAKE (v3.7 -p 1 -m 20 -o 2 -r0.7) into 379 contigs (mean size =5460 bp; max size =31,878 bp;
total bases =2,069,558 bp; N
50=8680 bp). The Fusobacterium sp.
3_1_36A2 genome assembly was aligned onto the type strain us-ing cross_match (http://www.phrap.org [-minmatch 29 -minscore59 -masklevel 101]) and ordered/oriented based on the latter.
Fusobacterium tumor isolate contigs were, in turn, aligned onto
the reordered Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_36A2 HMP genome assembly
and ordered/oriented according to that genome sequence, using
the same cross_match parameters. Three-way cross_match align-
ments between the ordered Fusobacterium genomes were performed
and plotted using hive plots (http://www.hiveplot.com).
Epithelial cell invasion assays
Caco-2 cell invasion assays with CC53 were carried out in triplicate
using a differential staining immunofluorescence procedure as
previously described (Strauss et al. 2011). Briefly, bacterial cultures
were grown to late log phase according to predetermined growth-curve data and normalized for cell number using McFarlandstandards. Caco-2 cells were grown to 80% confluence on glass
coverslips in 24-well plates and infected at a multiplicity of in-
fection of 100:1 (bacterial cells:intestinal cells). Infected cells weremaintained for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
2following infection, after
which time cells were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent
bacteria and then fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde, and blocked
in 10% (v/v) normal goat serum. Prepared polyclonal antibodieswere diluted to 1/500, applied to coverslips, and incubated for 1 h
at 37 °C. Coverslips were then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit
(EAV_AS1) or anti-rat (EAV_AS2) Alexa 350 (1/100) (Molecular
Probes), permeabilized by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, andthen re-incubated with prepared polyclonal antibodies, as above.
Following this, cells were labeled with donkey anti rat or anti-rabbit
Cy3 (1/500) for 30 min at 37 °C, as well as Alexa 488 Phalloidin
(Molecular Probes) (1/200). Coverslips were mounted onto glassslides and examined at 40 3magnification using a Leica DMIREB2
microscope and an ORCA-ER digital camera. Images were capturedusing Volocity (Improvision) software. Using this protocol, bacteriaexternal to the host cell were labeled with both Cy3 and Alexa 350
(and appeared purple when channels were merged), whereas bacteria
inside the cells were labeled with Cy3 only (appearing only orangewhen channels were merged). Each invasion assay was carried out on
three separate occasions using freshly prepared Caco-2 cells and
bacterial inocula.
