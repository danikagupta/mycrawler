2ABSTRACT
High carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations negatively impact fish, which makes data on its tolerance especially
relevant for production systems that can accumulate CO 2such as recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). The
current study evaluates the effect of CO 2on the growth performance, welfare, and health of Atlantic salmon post-
smolts in RAS. This study consisted of two phases. The first was a CO 2exposure phase, where eighteen tanks
were used with six treatments in triplicate: 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 40 mg/L of CO 2during 12 weeks in a 12 ppt
salinity RAS (hereafter RAS phase). In the second phase, PIT-tagged fish were transferred to a 34 ppt salinity
single flow-through tank at CO 2< 5 mg/L (hereafter seawater phase) for an additional 6-week experimental
period mimicking a seawater phase. Overall, mortality of fish exposed to CO 2was low and not related to
treatments. The mean final body weight was significantly higher in the 5 mg/L treatment compared to CO 2
treatments ≥12 mg/L at the end of RAS phase and to CO 2treatments ≥33 mg/L at the end of seawater phase.
Moreover, regressions showed that growth significantly decreased linearly with increasing CO 2in the water. Eye
cataracts and visible external damage on skin, operculum, and fins were inexistent and similar among CO 2
treatments. Kidneys showed no signs of mineral deposits in any of the structures of the tissue. However, skin
analysis showed that fish exposed to high CO 2concentrations had a significantly thinner dermis layer (both at
the end of RAS and seawater phase) and a significantly thinner epidermis layer and lower mucus cells count (atthe end of seawater phase). In conclusion, Atlantic salmon post-smolts cultured in brackish water RAS showed a
maximum growth performance at CO
2concentrations below 12 mg/L. Except skin, no major effects of health and
welfare were observed, including cataracts and nephrocalcinosis. Further studies should evaluate the molecular
and physiological responses to both short-term and long-term carbon dioxide exposure.
1. Introduction
Production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has had an impressive
cumulative growth of 384% since 1995 (5–8% annual growth),
reaching 2 million tonnes per year in 2014 (FAO, 2016). However,
production growth has ceased since 2014 and stabilized just above 2 M
tonnes per year. This stagnation is mainly associated with the reduced
availability of licensed sites for sea cage farming, and to the increasing
pressure for controlling pathogens and parasites, especially theectoparasite sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Alternative production
systems to the traditional sea cages are gaining momentum, particularly
land-based recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) facilities to produce
smolts, post-smolts or all the way to marked-size fish (Dalsgaard et al.,
2013; Martins et al., 2010; Summerfelt et al., 2016). The majority of
facilities being designed or under consideration in Norway at the mo-ment are however to produce post-smolts up to 1 kg (Hagspiel et al.,
2018). The distinctive characteristics of RAS (e.g. flexible location,
production environment control and biosecurity) along with the

Tconverging production costs between sea cage farming and RAS (Liu
et al., 2016) are inviting more production of Atlantic salmon in RAS,
perhaps to levels as much as 5–10% of the total production by 2020
(DNB Markets, 2017; Iversen et al., 2016). However, others still
maintain that RAS production has higher levels of financial uncertainty
compared to ocean pens for producing market-size Atlantic salmon
(King et al., 2016).
Extensive research efforts are therefore being done to optimize the
design and dimensioning of RAS, especially solutions regarding the
negative consequences of water re-use, i.e. the accumulation fish me-
tabolites like ammonia and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the water (Mota
et al., 2014; Summerfelt et al., 2015; Terjesen et al., 2013). CO 2re-
moval is one of the most costly unit processes, since CO 2levels limit fish
density and determines system flow in many cases and therefore energycosts of pumping water through the fish tanks (Colt et al., 2012; Noble
et al., 2012; Summerfelt et al., 2000; Summerfelt et al., 2003). To im-
prove CO
2removal and better manage CO 2concentration in RAS, it is
necessary to generate reliable data on fish tolerance to CO 2. Fish CO 2
tolerance has been vastly studied in the context of increasing CO 2levels
in the sea, for a review see Heuer and Grosell (2014). However, even
the 100-year CO 2level projections (1–2 mg/L) (Ou et al., 2015) are
notably lower than the levels typically recorded in commercial aqua-culture tanks for salmonids (10–20 mg/L) (Fivelstad, 2013; Gorle et al.,
2018). Such high CO
2concentrations observed in tanks producing
commercially important species such as Atlantic salmon led to a wide
number of studies focusing on the effects of long term exposure to high
CO2levels (Fivelstad, 2013; Good et al., 2010; Methling et al., 2013;
Moran and Støttrup, 2011; Santos et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2017;
Stiller et al., 2015). These studies showed that high CO 2concentrations
disturb fish acid-balance, induce stress response, increase ne-phrocalcinosis incidence, energy metabolism, and feed conversion
ratio, and reduces body condition factor, feed intake, and growth.
The CO
2concentrations that trigger negative growth performance in
Atlantic salmon smolts and post-smolts have been suggested to range
from 15 to 20 mg/L (Fivelstad, 2013; Fivelstad et al., 1998). However,
these exposure studies were conducted in flow-through systems, seereview by Fivelstad (2013), which are notably distinct from RAS, where
water is re-used. A recent study in RAS showed that Atlantic salmonperforms similarly when exposed to a CO
2concentration of 8 or 20 mg/
L (Good et al., 2018); however, that study was done in a high-alkalinity
(> 200 mg as CaCO 3) freshwater environment. Thus, several compre-
hensive studies testing a wider range of CO 2concentrations and dif-
ferent environments and life-stages are needed to better determine the
maximum tolerance levels of Atlantic salmon to CO 2.
In recent years, Atlantic salmon post-smolts production in brackish
water (12–20 ppt) RAS has been increasing. Thus, it is relevant to de-
termine the optimal water quality parameters in these conditions, in-
cluding CO 2, to ensure optimal fish welfare, health and performance.
Also, how skin integrity copes with a high CO 2environment isworth investigating, as Atlantic salmon skin epidermis and dermis in-creases in thickness and mucus cell numbers resulting from transferring
fish from freshwater to seawater (Karlsen et al., 2018).
The objective of the present study was to determine the CO
2con-
centration in 12 ppt salinity RAS up to which no negative consequences
are observed for growth performance, health, or welfare of Atlanticsalmon post-smolts. To this end, fish were exposed to six dissolved CO
2
concentrations 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 40 mg/L during a 12-week periodin RAS. Additionally, fish were subjected to a subsequent 6-week period
in flow-through seawater to understand if the effects of earlier CO
2
exposure persist or not, when fish are moved into sea cages to grow tomarket size.
2. Materialandmethods
2.1. Experimental design
This study consisted of two experimental phases (Fig. 1). The first
was a CO
2exposure phase, where eighteen tanks were used as experi-
mental units in a mono-factorial design with six treatments (CO 2con-
centrations) and three replicates per treatment: 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and
40 mg/L of CO 2during 12-weeks in a 12 ppt salinity RAS (hereafter
termed RAS phase). In the second phase, PIT-tagged fish were trans-ferred to a 34 ppt salinity single flow-through tank at CO
2< 5 mg/L
(hereafter termed seawater phase) for an additional 6-week experi-mental period mimicking a seawater phase.
2.2. Experimental fish and feed
All procedures involving fish were approved by the Norwegian Food
Safety Authority animal experimentation approval system (FOTS) with
the reference ID 9165. Atlantic salmon eyed eggs (SalmoBreed, Os,
Norway) were hatched and raised in a flow-through system (Nofima
Research Station for Sustainable Aquaculture, Sunndalsøra, Norway) at
9 °C under continuous light (LD 24:00) photoperiod until 44 g, at which
point they received a 6-week winter stimulus (LD 12:12) followed by a
return to LD24:00 to induce smoltification. Fish were individually pit-
tagged with a smart glass tag (Smartrac, Reichshof-Wehnrath,
Germany). Atlantic salmon post-smolts (N = 900; 67 ± 8 g) were
captured from a main holding tank, ten fish at a time, and then for eachcatchment of fish, randomly distributed over eighteen experimental
tanks (N = 50 fish/tank) in Nofima Centre for Recirculation in
Aquaculture, Sunndalsøra, Norway (Terjesen et al., 2013). The fish
were subsequently allowed to adapt to the rearing and feeding condi-
tions for a 3-week period. After this period, fish body weight and length
were measured and 46 fish per tank were stocked back for a 12-week
CO
2exposure period. Mean weight and density at the beginning of the
experiment were 71 ± 9 g and 6.4 ± 0.1 kg/m3, respectively. At the
end of the 12-week experimental period, five fish per tank (total 90
Fig.1. Experimental design.V.C. Mota et al. Aqua culture 498 (2019) 578–586
579fish) were randomly selected and transferred to a single flow-through
tank (3.3 m3) for an additional 6-week experimental seawater phase, at
salinity 34 ppt and where CO 2was kept below 5 mg/L.
Fish were fed continuously (approx. 23 h day) with an automatic
belt feeder over satiation (120–140%) using a commercial diet(3–4 mm, Nutra Olympic, Skretting, Norway). Satiation percentage was
adjusted according to the feed spill observed.
2.3. Experimental system and water quality
Eighteen cylindro-conical experimental tanks (V = 0.5 m
3) were
connected to a RAS as previously described (Terjesen et al., 2013).
Briefly, the RAS consisted of a microscreen belt filter, a moving bed
bioreactor and a degasser column, two holding sump units, and ten
octagonal fish biomass tanks (Fig. 2). The ten octagonal tanks (3.3 m3)
with non-experimental Atlantic salmon post-smolts aimed to increasefish and feed load in the system to relevant intensity, resulting in anadded fish biomass of 1497 ± 265 kg and feed load of 21 ± 3 kg/day
(12-week experimental period average). The total RAS water volume
was 79 m
3, water exchange rate was approx. 1180 L/ kg feed (39%
water system volume / day), and system hydraulic retention time wasapprox. 2.8 days. This relatively high-water exchange rate was neces-
sary to control temperature at 13 °C. The make-up water (12 ppt sali-
nity) was added into the top of the RAS degasser column.
The different CO
2concentrations in each fish tank resulted from the
specific mix of two water inlets (Fig. 2): holding sump 1 (CO 2= 3 mg/
L) and holding sump 2 (CO 2= 40 mg/L). Each holding sump
(V = 2.2 m3each) had pure oxygen gas added through a diffusor and a
submerged pump to assure an adequate mix of the water. The holdingsump 2 had CO
2gas added through a diffusor from a pressurized CO 2-
gas bottle. The CO 2concentration in the holding sump 2 was con-
tinuously monitored (every 1 min.) through a CO 2sensor (OxyGuard,
Denmark) connected to an analogue unit (Pacific, OxyGuard, Den-
mark). Due to the acidifying action of the CO 2in holding sump 2, it was

NaHCO 3(50–75 g/L) was added via an electromagnetic metering pump
(Iwaki Norge, Oslo, Norway) controlled by an automatic pH controlsystem (Walchem, MA, USA).
Water quality in fish tanks was maintained within the re-
commendations for Atlantic salmon post-smolts (Thorarensen and
Farrell, 2011). The water quality parameters measured during the two
experimental phases are presented in Table 1. Photoperiod was main-
tained at 24 L:00D throughout all experiment. Hydraulic retention time(HRT) for the experimental fish tanks was 45 min. and water flow was
checked twice weekly per tank.
2.4. Water sampling and analysis
All water quality parameters were measured and sampled at each
fish tank effluent, with the exception of temperature, pH, oxygen, and
salinity that were measured in the fish tank. The specific parameters,
method of analysis, and frequency are described in Table 2. New fac-
tory-calibrated CO
2sensors (Oxyguard, Denmark and Franatech, Ger-
many,N= 5) were pre-tested over the range of CO 2concentrations
studied (5–40 mg/L) and the displayed values were comparable withina 5 mg/L variation at the top range, i.e. 40 mg/L. NH
3-N concentrations
were calculated from the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrationsas a function of pH, temperature, and salinity (Johansson and Wedborg,
1980).PCO2 concentrations were calculated from the CO
2, temperature
and salinity values (Table 2 for measurement details), and from the
dissociation constants of carbonic acid in seawater (Roy et al., 1993).
2.5. Fish sampling and analysis
Five sampling events took place throughout the experiment: week 0,
week 3, week 6, week 12, and week 18. Five fish per tank were sampled
in each event; except in week 0 where only two fish per tank were
sampled. Fish were anesthetized (0.12 g/L MS-222) prior to handling or
euthanized (0.5 g/L MS-222) prior to tissue sampling. Fish mortality
was assessed and recorded daily in each fish tank. Individual weight
and length were measured in all sampling events, and condition factor
and growth were calculated from these measurements.
Condition factor was calculated as:
= ×CF 100 W/L3
where W is individual weight in grams and L is the length in cen-
timeters.
Thermal growth coefficient (TGC) was calculated as:
= × × TGC 1000 (W –W )/(T t) 21/311/3
where T is the water temperature in °C and ΔT is the number of daysbetween time T
1and T 2.
External welfare indicators were scored at every sampling point by
examining fish (N = 5 per replicated tank) for eye cataracts,operculum, skin, and fins condition. Dorsal, pectoral, pelvic and caudal
fins were examined and scored from 0 to 5 according to an adapted
scale from Hoyle et al. (2007): score 0 was given for lack of damage/
erosion and maximum score of 5 was given for most severe damages/erosions. Skin lesions and operculum status was scored from 0 to 2
according to Kolarevic et al. (2013): 0 for lack of damage and 2 for
severe damage. Eyes were examined for presence of cataract using a
portable slit lamp SL-17 (Kowa, Tokyo, Japan) and were scored be-
tween 0 and 4 according to Wall and Bjerkas (1999).
Kidneys were examined for mineral deposits, i.e. nephrocalcinosis.
Each kidney was scored by visual examination as 0 (normal kidney), 1
(minor kidney swollen and < 10 nodules), 2 (kidney swollen, grey
colour, irregular surface and many but separated nodules), or 3 (kidney
swollen, grey colour, irregular surface and interconnected nodules
forming continuous areas) adapted from Fivelstad et al. (2003). For
histology analysis, a portion of mid kidney tissue (1 cm) was dissected
and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (CellStor pots, CellPath,
Powys, U.K.). The samples were dehydrated and processed according tostandard protocols. Paraplast embedded samples were microtome cut
(5 μm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Merck KGaA, Darm-
stadt, Germany). The stained slides were examined using a standard
Nikon Optiphot light microscope (Nikon, Japan). The sections were
blind evaluated for pathologies and deviations on tissue morphology.
Skin samples from below the dorsal fin and above the lateral line
were dissected and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (CellStor
pots, CellPath, Powys, U.K.) for histology. Skin samples were dehy-
drated through graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin
(Histowax, Histolab Products AB). Sections (5 μm) were prepared in the
anterior-posterior direction using a Microm HM 355S (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., MA, USA). Parallel sections (N = 2 per fish) were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin (HE, Sigma-Aldrich). Images and measure-
ments were done with Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 equipped with an
AxioCam MRc5 camera and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging GmbH, Göttingen,
Germany). Overall morphology was examined, number of mucus
cells were counted, and epidermis and dermis thickness measured
(N= 10 measurements per sample) using the AxioVision software (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging GmbH). Histology analysis only considered samplesfrom week 12 and week 18 and treatments 5 and 40 mg/L. Skin his-
tology at week 12 additionally analyzed treatment 19 mg/L.
2.6. Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics V25
(IBM, Corp., USA). The effect of CO
2on fish performance parameters
was analyzed by linear regressions. Growth performance parameters
and water quality comparisons among treatments were performed using
one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD test (equal variances
assumed) or Games-Howell test (unequal variances). Skin parameter
differences between treatments at week 12 (5, 19 and 40 mg/L) wereTable2

3. Results
3.1. Water quality
Water quality parameters measured during the two experimental
periods (RAS and seawater phase) are summarized in Table 1. Differ-
ences in water quality among CO
2treatments at the end of RAS phase
were related to experimental treatments: higher CO 2treatments had
significantly higher dissolved CO 2(in mg/L and mm Hg), and sig-
nificantly lower pH and unionized ammonia nitrogen (NH 3-N). The
exception was dissolved O 2that was significantly lower in the treat-
ment 5 mg/L compared to the treatment 40 mg/L, but all values were
above 85% of air saturation at 92 ± 0 and 95 ± 1%, respectively. All
other averaged water quality parameters at the end of RAS phase did
not significantly differ among treatments.
3.2. Fish performance
Overall mortality of fish exposed to CO 2was low, with one dead fish
in total throughout the experimental period (Table 3). Average fish tank
density during the RAS phase was 6 kg/m3and 21 kg/m3, at week 6 and
12 respectively, whereas during the Seawater phase density was 6 kg/m
3and 9 kg/m3, at week 12 and 18 respectively. Growth curves show
that the fish body weight was similar among CO 2treatments up to
about mid-way through the RAS phase (week 0, 3 and 6; P-value > .05)
while and from there on fish body weight significantly differed towards
the end of RAS phase (week 12; P-value < .001) and the subsequent
seawater phase (week 18; P-value = .003) (Fig. 3). Additionally, pair-
wise comparisons among the treatments showed that the mean final
body weight (FBW) was significantly higher in the 5 mg/L treatment
compared to CO 2treatments ≥12 mg/L at the end of RAS phase (week
12;P-value < .001). Moreover, fish in the CO 2treatment 5 mg/L pre-
sented a significantly higher FBW when compared to CO 2treatments
≥33 mg/L at the end of seawater phase (week 18; P-value = .003)
(Table 3). Fig. 4 shows the relationship between CO 2in the water and
fish growth as thermal growth coefficient (TGC), where TGC sig-nificantly decreases linearly with increasing CO
2in the water at the end
of RAS phase and at the end of seawater phase. Comparisons amongtreatments show that TGC was significantly higher in the 5 mg/L
treatment compared to CO
2treatments ≥12 mg/L during RAS phase
(week 12; P-value < .001), whereas no differences among groups were
observed during the seawater phase (week 18; P-value = .095).

External welfare observations on eye cataracts and damage on skin,
operculum, and fins were similar among CO 2treatments, with low
overall scores for each of the five samplings (week 0, 3, 6, 12 and
18): < 0.1 (0–4 index) cataracts, < 0.5 (0–2 index) for skin and oper-
culum and, < 1 for fins (0–5 index). The visual kidney scores for ne-
phrocalcinosis at each of the five samplings were similar among treat-
ments, with only a few fish (5 out of 396 experimental fish analyzed)
showing minor calcium deposits (score 1). Histology of kidney samples
analyzed (N = 24) on the two extreme groups, i.e. only 5 mg/L and
40 mg/L showed normal morphology in all analyzed samples (end of
RAS phase and seawater phase). Specifically, there were no signs of
mineral deposits in any of the structures of the kidney tissue.
Histology results of skin, including dermis, epidermis, scales, and
mucus cells are shown in Fig. 5. At the end of RAS phase, the dermis
layer was significantly thinner (P-value = .047) in fish from treatment19 mg/L (23% thinner) and 40 mg/L (22%) compared to fish from the
5 mg/L treatment, but epidermis and scale thickness were similar be-
tween these three CO
2treatments (Fig. 6a). Mucus cells number did not
differ between any of these three treatments. At the end of seawaterphase, both dermis (41% thinner; P-value = .009) and epidermis (15%;
P-value = .007) were significantly thinner in fish from the 40 mg/Ltreatment compared to the 5 mg/L treatment, but scale thickness was
similar between these two CO
2treatments (Fig. 6b). The number of
mucus cells were significantly lower (P-value = .010) between the
5 mg/L treatment (22.4 ± 3.6 cells/100 μm) compared to the 40 mg/L
treatment (11.4 ± 1.4 cells/100 μm).
4. Discussion
The current study shows that growth in Atlantic salmon post-smolts
is negatively linear-related to CO 2exposure, indicating that the growth
penalty of CO 2starts at lower concentrations than previously reported
(< 12 mg/L). Results suggest that exposing Atlantic salmon post-smolt
to an increase in CO 2of 10 mg/L would correspondingly decrease their
TGC by approximately 0.2 units. As the highest TGC averaged 2.2during this study, an approximate 10% of growth reduction was ob-
served for every 10 mg/L increase in CO 2, over the range of CO 2con-
centrations studied (5–40 mg/L). Moreover, CO 2exposure effects ob-
served during RAS phase were carried over to seawater phase.
Furthermore, fish exposed to high CO 2concentrations (40 mg/L) pre-
sented a thinner skin dermis. However, in contrast, fish survival, eyecataracts, nephrocalcinosis and several external welfare indicators ofAtlantic salmon post-smolts were not affected by the 12-week exposure
to CO
2concentrations up to 40 mg/L in RAS.
The water quality during the experiment was, with the exception of
CO2, within the recommended levels for Atlantic salmon post-smolts
(Thorarensen and Farrell, 2011). This was also the case for NH 3-N.
Despite significantly higher NH 3-N concentrations for the control group
(1.5 μg/L) compared to the other CO 2treatments, the levels were far
below the threshold value (> 14 μg/L) previously shown to negatively
impact Atlantic salmon (Kolarevic et al., 2012; Kolarevic et al., 2013).
Dissolved oxygen also differed among the treatments, which was likelydue to a higher feed intake from the fish exposed to lower CO
2con-
centrations (data not shown). Nevertheless, the oxygen concentrationswere above the optimal 85% saturation for all the treatments
(Thorarensen and Farrell, 2011). Water pH was another quality para-
meter that differed among treatments; increasing CO
2levels led to a
decrease in pH levels due to the acidic effect of CO 2. The interaction
between these both variables on fish performance was shown pre-
viously (Fivelstad, 2013; Fivelstad et al., 1998; Steinberg et al., 2017).
However, in our study, the decrease of pH due to the CO 2supply was
partly counteracted by adding a sodium bicarbonate solution, which
stabilized the pH levels (> 6.7) at levels previously shown not impact
Atlantic salmon growth performance (Fivelstad et al., 2004) so that the
effect observed in the current study could be only caused by the dif-
ferent CO 2levels.
Survival rates among Atlantic salmon post-smolts exposed up to
40 mg/L CO 2levels during 12 weeks were close to 100%, and remained
so through all 6 weeks during the following seawater phase. Thus, it
seems that Atlantic salmon post-smolts are able to withstand high levels
of CO 2without major mortalities, as similar survival rates were found
in other long-term exposure CO 2studies up to 15–20 mg/L with

Fish body weight and growth rates are key indicators to assess fish
culture conditions. In flow-through systems it was shown that CO 2
concentrations up to 15 to 20 mg/L reduce Atlantic salmon growth
rates, see review by Fivelstad (2013). However, a study performed in
freshwater RAS exposing Atlantic salmon up to harvest weight in freshwater to two CO
2concentrations of 8 and 20 mg/L showed no differ-
ence in growth performance between these two treatments (Good et al.,2018). Similarly, in the current study, where six CO
2treatments were
used, the results of growth were consistent with Good et al. (2018) in
the same range, 12 and 19 mg/L. However, the present study went
beyond a 2-treatment design and tested six CO 2treatments and a wider
range of CO 2concentrations (5–40 mg/L). This allowed a linear re-
gression analysis that showed a significantly negative relationship be-
tween fish growth and CO 2concentration, which was not visible only
when two concentrations were compared. Likewise, a negative linearrelationship between fish growth and the concentration of CO
2that fish
are exposed to was recently shown for a seawater flow-through system(Fivelstad et al., 2018). However, in contrast to our study, Fivelstad
et al. (2018) divided the 12-week experimental period into four periods.
In the first three periods polynominal or non-relationships between fish
growth and the concentration of CO
2were observed, and only in the
last period was this negative linear relationship shown. Another study
with pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), also observed a linear decrease infinal body weight with increasing CO 2levels (Steinberg et al., 2017). To
our best knowledge, our study showed for the first time that there is a
linear decrease of growth when CO 2concentration is increased in
Atlantic salmon post-smolts raised in brackish water RAS.
A seawater phase grow-out in cages is commonly used after the land
phase to grow Atlantic salmon post-smolt into market size fish (4–5 kg).The fish performance during the sea phase depends on several factors,
particularly the previous culture conditions during the land phase,
which nowadays occurs increasingly in RAS. In the current study, fish
were grown for an extra 6 weeks in a system mimicking a seawater
phase (34 ppt salinity, flow through, < 5 mg/L CO
2). We observed that
the fish that were previously exposed to CO 2concentrations equal to or
higher than 33 mg/L presented a lower body weight, whereas all other
CO2treatments were able to recover the previous weight deficit, when
compared to fish exposed to 5 mg/L. Noteworthy, a linear regression (P-value = .004) for these 6 weeks growth shows that the effects of CO
2
exposure previously observed in the RAS phase persist into seawaterphase. This result shows that it is important to consider CO
2exposure in
the earliest phases, even when part of the grow out phase is conductedin an environment low in CO
2such as a seawater phase.
External welfare indicators were generally optimal throughout the
experiment for fish in all CO 2treatments without major signs of ex-
ternal injuries. Score values of the eye cataracts and damage on skin,operculum, and fins were similar among CO
2treatments and compar-
able to other studies on Atlantic salmon (Kolarevic et al., 2013). Cat-aracts have been reported to increase in fish raised in RAS (Davidson
et al., 2017; Neves and Brown, 2015) and at high CO
2levels (Moran
et al., 2012), but in our study no significant cataracts were observed infish raised in RAS even when fish were exposed to high CO
2con-
centrations. Other factors have been linked to cataract formation, suchas rapid changes in environmental parameters, e.g. water temperature,
salinity and nutrition (Bjerkås and Sveier, 2004). The absence of eye
cataracts in our trial, where water quality parameters were maintained
stable during the 12 week RAS phase, highlights the advantage of the
environmental control attained in RAS.
Nephrocalcinosis, a kidney lesion that comprises renal degeneration
with mineral deposits and nodule formations, is a pathology commonly
associated to high CO
2concentration exposure. For instance, a previous
study showed that 88% of the Atlantic salmon smolts exposed to 16 mg/
L of CO 2for 54 days in fresh water presented nephrocalcinosis
(Fivelstad et al., 2003). In a second study, 34% of Atlantic salmon post-smolts exposed to 21–30 mg/L CO
2for 12 weeks in seawater also pre-
sented nephrocalcinosis (Fivelstad et al., 2018). In contrast, ne-phrocalcinosis was not found in another study where Atlantic salmon
post-smolts were exposed up to 44 mg/L CO
2for 43 days in seawater,
(Fivelstad et al., 1998) neither in a study where Atlantic salmon wereexposed up to 20 mg/L of CO
2for 384 days in freshwater (Good et al.,
2018) nor was it found in another study where rainbow trout wereexposed to 24 mg/L CO
2for 6 months (Good et al., 2010). In the current
study, the incidence of nephrocalcinosis was minor, with 5 fish out ofthe 396 fish analised showing minor signs even when exposed to arti-
ficially high concentrations of CO
2(up to 40 mg/L) for 12 weeks. The
results from the present study show that environmental factors otherthan elevated CO
2must have an important role in the development of
nephrocalcinosis. Diet composition, namely high concentrations ofcalcium coupled with phosphorus, may also cause nephrocalcinosis
(Richardson et al., 1985; Smart et al., 1979). Water chemistry, in par-
ticular the source of alkalinity, may cause nephrocalcinosis, as a change
of calcium carbonate for sodium bicarbonate seems to reduce the pre-
valence of nephrocalcinosis in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) grown
in RAS (Chen et al., 2001). This topic should be further studied for
Atlantic salmon, since nephrocalcinosis incidence is recurrent in com-
mercial conditions and poses important economic losses.
Skin is the first defense barrier to the external environment and
plays an important role in fish protection and preservation from sub-
optimal water quality. In the current study, skin histology showed that
Fig.6. Dermis, epidermis and scale layer thickness of fish exposed to 5, 19 and

40 mg/L at end of seawater phase (week 18). *Indicates significantly differences
between CO 2treatments. NS – non-significant differences.V.C. Mota et al. Aqua culture 498 (2019) 578–586
584fish exposed to 5 mg/L CO 2at the end of RAS phase had normal dermis,
whereas fish from 19 and 40 mg/L showed thinner dermis. The epi-
dermis and mucus cells, of the first treatment showed a good organi-
zation of cells lining the basement membrane and flat cells at the outer
part of the epidermis. In contrast, the other two treatments resulted in a
more uneven epidermis and thus could lead to a more permeable bar-
rier and ion selectivity disturbances. These changes in the skin layer
morphology and thickness could be due to a higher CO 2concentration
exposure, as a previous study have shown that suboptimal water qualitycan change skin properties (Sveen et al., 2016).
At the end of seawater phase, for the 5 mg/L treatment, the skin
(dermis, epidermis, scales and mucous cells) appeared normal, whereas
for the 40 mg/L treatment more connective tissue and connective tissue
with a looser structure under the scales was observed and severe
morphological deviations in the epidermis, including thin layer and
condensed cells. The cause for these deviations in the skin in this
treatment is uncertain. They could result from the combination several
factors, including the adaptation from a high CO
2environment (RAS
phase) into a low CO 2environment (seawater phase) and from the
transfer of an isosmotic environment (RAS phase; 12 ppt salinity) to a
hyperosmotic environment (seawater phase; 34 ppt salinity). Changes
in the skin epidermal and dermal thickness were shown after Atlantic
salmon seawater transfer (Karlsen et al., 2018). Furthermore, these
authors demonstrated that a thinner dermis and epidermis may be as-
sociated with a reduction in the immune activity in the skin. This may
suggest that a sub-optimal rearing environment, such as high CO 2
concentrations or a sudden salinity change can have implications onskin defense mechanisms against infectious agents. However, the cau-
sative agent for thinner and less organized dermis observed in our study
is unknown and thus the mechanisms behind this fish response should
be addressed in future studies.
The current study brings a new insight on the growth of Atlantic
salmon post-smolts in brackish water RAS and shows that maximumgrowth performance is obtained in CO
2concentrations below 12 mg/L.
Skin health seems to be compromised in fish exposed to very high CO 2
concentrations (40 mg/L). In contrast, with the exception of skin, no
major effects of health and welfare were observed for the indicators
here analyzed up to an exposure to 40 mg/L, including cataracts and
nephrocalcinosis. The data from this study is relevant for the design,
dimensioning, and management of RAS. Further studies should evaluate
the molecular and physiological responses to both short-term and long-
term carbon dioxide exposure to understand the fish adaptation me-
chanism to these conditions.
