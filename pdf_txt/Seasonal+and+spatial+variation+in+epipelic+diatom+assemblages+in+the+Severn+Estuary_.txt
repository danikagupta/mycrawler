INTRODUCTION
Intertidal mudflats are known as highly productive
areas that may contribute up to 50% of the primaryproduction of estuaries (e.g. Underwood & Kromkamp1999). In these sediments, epipelic diatoms form thebase of the food web (Admiraal et al. 1984b, Under-wood et al. 1998). These diatoms form a biofilm on thesediment surface. Benthic diatoms produce copiousamounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)(e.g. Stal 2003 and references therein), which are
considered to render stability to the sediment byincreasing the erosion threshold (e.g. Decho 2000).Microphytobenthos is an important food source formicro-, meio- and macrobenthic organisms and forbacteria (e.g. Heip et al. 1995, Middelburg et al. 2000,de Deckere et al. 2001).
Estuaries and their intertidal sediments experience
large fluctuations in hydrological, morphological andchemical conditions. This may drive changes in the

ABSTRACT: The composition and seasonal dynamics of biofilm-associated eukaryotic communities
were analysed at the metre and kilometre scale along a salinity gradient in the Westerschelde estu-ary (The Netherlands), using microscopy and a genetic fingerprinting technique (PCR-DGGE).Microphytobenthic biomass, measured as chlorophyll a(chl a), varied seasonally over 2 orders of
magnitude, being highest in spring. Communities were dominated by epipelic diatoms, in particularby members of the genus Navicula . In spring, a few smaller epipelic diatom species dominated
during biomass peaks, while during the rest of the year, communities were more diverse andwere characterised by larger species. The microphytobenthic community collapsed when grazersappeared, which happened concomitantly with a rise in temperature. Spring biomass developmentwas associated with marked changes in porewater nutrient concentrations, especially towards theestuary mouth. In the DGGE data, diatoms, ciliates, amoebae, copepods, nematodes, annelids andplatyhelminthes were detected. Ordination analysis of the species counts and DGGE data werelargely congruent and indicated that on the scale of the whole estuary (i.e. km scale), taxonomicturnover in microphytobenthos composition was mainly associated with the salinity gradient. Atsmaller spatial scales, the position of sampling localities along the tidal exposure gradient appearedto be the main determinant of species turnover, in particular in the brackish reaches of the estuary.

diversity and structure of the biofilm communities.
Some species seem to be limited to a narrow habitat,while others tolerate a much wider range of environ-mental variations. Besides their distribution along thegradients in the estuary, organisms in the sedimentalso show distinct seasonal variations, while the situa-tion may also differ from year to year. These relate tochanges and variations in temperature, irradiance,river discharge etc. Last but not least, predation andcompetition are also factors that influence communitycomposition and structure.
The vast majority of studies on the structure of ben-
thic diatom communities are based on microscopicobservations of acid-cleaned sediment samples (e.g.Sabbe 1993, Thornton et al. 2002, Haubois et al.2005). This approach has limitations. Not only is ittime consuming and requires detailed knowledge ofthe taxonomy of these organisms but, more impor-tantly, it does not permit one to distinguish betweenempty frustules and living cells. Frustules of deadbenthic diatoms may remain present in the sedimentfor prolonged periods, and silty sediments often con-tain many frustules of sedimented planktonic forms.This may interfere with the detection of detailed sea-sonal and spatial patterns in community compositionand diversity of the biofilm-forming diatoms. Molecu-lar biological techniques allow the processing andcomparison of large number of samples in a short time(Muyzer et al. 1993). An additional advantage lies inthe possibility to assess diversity andcommunity composition of notoriouslydifficult-to-study groups of organisms,e.g. ciliates and flagellates. A numberof papers that studied diversity ofeukaryotes by using the small subunitribosomal RNA genes (i.e. the 18SrRNA gene or the 16S rRNA gene ofthe chloroplast) showed the enormousdiversity present in different environ-ments (e.g. Diez et al. 2001, Massana etal. 2002, Stoeck & Epstein 2003, Law-ley et al. 2004). Only a few studiescombined microscopy and genetic fin-gerprinting techniques in order tostudy the phytoplankton communitiesin the Bay of Fundy and in the solarsalterns of Bras del Port (e.g. Estrada etal. 2004, Savin et al. 2004). To date,however, this approach has not beenapplied to estuarine or marine micro-benthic communities.
The aim of the present study was to
investigate the changes in the spatialstructure and the seasonal dynamics ofdiatom biofilms and associated grazercommunities along a salinity gradient in the Wester-
schelde estuary and to determine the environmentalparameters that control them. We applied both light-microscopical analysis and denaturing gradient gelelectrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 18S rRNAgene fragments in order to evaluate discrepancies,congruence and potential complementarities betweenboth marker sets. Ordination techniques were used torelate the observed species or DGGE bands to environ-mental variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site description and sampling. Three different sites
in the Westerschelde estuary, i.e. Appelzak (A), Biezel-ingsche Ham (B) and Paulina polder (P), with averagesalinities of 5.4, 17.6 and 20.4‰, respectively, wereselected for measurements (see Fig. 1). Appelzak andBiezelingsche Ham were sampled at a high- (1) and ata mid-shore station (2), while Paulina polder was sam-pled at a mid-shore station only. The difference inemersion time between the high- and mid-shore sta-tions ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 h. Station positions weredetermined by GPS (geographical positioning system).Each location was sampled 9 times between April 2002and September 2003. Sampling was done during lowtide, between 10:00 and 14:00 h Detailed informationon the physical and biological parameters of these sites

can be found in Forster et al. (2006). More general
information about the intertidal benthic ecosystems ofthe Westerschelde estuary can be found in Meire et al.(2005) and Baeyens et al. (1998).
Surface sediment samples (i.e. the upper 2 mm) were
taken using a ‘contact corer’ by freezing the sedi-ment surface through a metal disk that contains liquidnitrogen (Ford & Honeywill 2002). At each station, 5replicate samples were taken within 5 m of the GPSlocation. Samples were used for determination ofmicrophytobenthic chlorophyll a(chl a), water content
and for DNA extraction. In order to reduce the totalnumber of samples for analysis, we only used the repli-cate samples with the highest chl avalues for the PCR-
DGGE. Preliminary analyses (not shown) revealed thatthe high chl asamples compared well with the other
replicates containing less chl a, with differences being
much lower than those among samples from differentlocations and/or sampling periods. For grain sizeanalysis and microscopy, replicate samples werepooled. Porewater was obtained by centrifugation(10 min at 2500 rpm [1000 ×g]at 10°C); the super-
natant was filtered (GF/F) and frozen (–20°C) untilfurther chemical analyses.
Environmental parameters. The shore heights of the
stations were determined by reference to a digital ele-vation model of the estuary and confirmed by directobservation of the timing of emersion and immersionperiods. Sediment surface temperatures were mea-sured with an electronic thermometer at each sam-pling occasion. The mean irradiance at all sites wasrecorded at hourly intervals during 2002 and 2003using a Licor Li-192 sensor.
For chl ameasurements, the samples were freeze-
dried and stored at –80°C until analysis. Pigmentswere extracted with 90% (v/v) acetone from aliquotsof 100 mg of freeze-dried sediments. Mechanical dis-ruption using 1 mm beads in a BeadBeater for 20 s en-sured an efficient release of pigments. Acetone extractswere quantified using HPLC (Rijstenbil 2003). NO
2–-N,
NO 3–-N, NH 4+-N and PO 43–-P were measured using
standard colorimetric techniques (Grasshoff 1976) on aSKALAR SA 4000 segmented flow analyser. Salinitywas measured using a titration method with SAC 80(Radiometer). The percentage of water was determinedby the loss of weight of the sample after 48 h of freeze-drying. Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured withan elemental analyser (Elementar, vario EL). Sedimentgrain size and silt content of the sediment were deter-mined by granulometric analysis using a laser diffrac-tion analyser (Malvern Mastersizer 2000).
Morphological identification of diatoms. Samples
were oxidised with a 1:1 mixture of hydrogen peroxide(30% [v/v]) and acetic acid (100% [v/v]), rinsed severaltimes with distilled water and mounted in Naphrax(PhycoTech). Identifications and cell counts were
made using a Leitz Diaplan microscope equipped withdifferential interference contrast (DIC). Identificationsfollowed Sabbe (1997). Per sample ca. 300 diatomvalves were counted (min. 277, max. 336), and relativeabundances were calculated. Microscopic analyses ofboth live and glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens allowedassignment of species to 4 functional categories basedon their mode of life: epipsammic, epipelic, tycho-plankton and true plankton (Vos & Dewolf 1993,Forster et al. 2006). Diatoms belonging to the epipsam-mic fraction (small species attached to sand grains)were not included in the present analyses as they werenever abundant at the study sites (Forster et al. 2006).Previous analyses have shown that tychoplanktonictaxa (that occur both as benthic and pelagic diatoms)were most abundant (up to 40%) when total commu-nity biomass based on chl aconcentration was the low-
est. As their exact life style is obscure and as it is notclear to what degree they contribute to the productiv-ity of biofilms (or whether they mainly comprise non-active or dead cells), we have also omitted them fromthe analyses. Likewise, the truly pelagic fraction,which mainly consisted of dead plankton cells thatsedimented from the water column, was not includedeither. The focus of the present paper is thereforesolely on the motile epipelic fraction, which makes upthe bulk of community biomass in intertidal areas (seee.g. Herlory et al. 2004). Only epipelic species, whichreach a relative abundance of 5% in at least 1 sample,were included in the analyses. The presence of valvesbelonging to rare species may be purely accidentaland, hence, may seriously distort community anddiversity analyses. Our analyses of patterns in distribu-tion and diversity therefore only pertain to the fractionof the biofilm-forming epipelic species that makes upthe bulk of the biofilm autotrophic biomass.
Biovolumes were calculated on the basis of the equa-
tions proposed by Hillebrand et al. (1999); these werethen used to determine the relative contribution ofeach species to the total biovolume of the cellscounted. The latter data were used in the ordinationanalyses and for the calculation of the diversity indicesof the diatom data (see below).
Genetic fingerprinting analysis. DNA was extracted
from 100 to 200 mg of sediment sample using the SoilDNA Extraction kit (MoBio Lab) combined with vor-texing at maximum speed for 10 min. PCR was per-formed with the primers Euk1Af and Euk516r-GC,which amplify an approximately 560 bp fragment ofthe 18S rRNA gene (Diez et al. 2001). PCR mixtures(50 µl) contained 10 to 20 ng of environmental DNA astemplate, each primer at a concentration of 0.5 µM,each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) at 200 µM,1.5 mM MgCl
2and 2.5 U of TaqDNA polymerase (Qia-255Aquat Microb Ecol 47: 253–266, 2007
gen). Reactions were performed in a Biometra thermo-
cycler with the following cycle: an initial denaturationof 95°C for 3 min, 25 cycles of denaturation of 95°C for45 s, annealing at 60°C for 1 min and extension at 72°Cfor 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCRproducts were first analysed by agarose electrophore-sis prior to DGGE analysis.
For DGGE, 6% polyacrylamide gels with a denatu-
rant gradient from 20 to 50% were used for analysingthe amplified DNA fragments. Approximately 300 ngof PCR product was applied to each well. Elec-trophoresis was run at a constant voltage of 100 V for16 h at 60°C. Subsequently, the gels were stained withethidium bromide and the results were visualisedusing the Gel Doc 1000 system (Biorad Laboratories).DGGE gel pictures were analysed using Phoretix 1DPro in order to obtain a matrix containing the band per-centage values of each sample as it was described inMassieux et al. (2004). These data were then used forthe ordination analyses of the genetic fingerprintingdata (see below). Major bands were excised from thegel, re-amplified and sequenced directly using thesame primers. The partial sequences were aligned intoan existing tree by using the ARB software package(Ludwig et al. 2004).
Data analysis. Ordination techniques were used to
relate the microscopic analysis and genetic finger-printing data to measured environmental variables.All analyses were performed with the software pack-age CANOCO for Windows 4.5 (ter Blaak & Smilauer1998). The species data were log-transformed prior toanalysis; the environmental data were re-standardisedto zero mean and unit variance in the Canoci for Win-dows program. Detrended correspondence analysis(DCA) using detrending by segments was applied inorder to determine the length of the gradient in thespecies and genetic fingerprinting data. Since thesevalues never exceeded 3 SD (standard deviation unitsof species turnover), we assumed that the species dataonly show a low degree of unimodality, in which caselinear ordination methods are more appropriate toanalyse the data (ter Braak & Smilauer 2002). Wetherefore used the direct, linear method of redundancyanalysis (RDA) to explore the relationships betweenthe environmental variables and the species composi-tion obtained by microscopic and genetic fingerprint-ing techniques. Forward selection procedures wereused to select minimal sets of environmental variablesthat relate significantly to the variation in the speciesand genetic fingerprinting data. The statistical signifi-cance of each selected variable was judged by a MonteCarlo permutation test (199 permutations, significancelevel p = 0.05). The remaining environmental variableswere added as supplementary (or passive) variables,i.e. they were added post hoc to the existing RDAanalyses by projection (i.e. regression onto the existing
axes). The Shannon index (see below) and the measureof the average cell biovolume per sample and the rela-tive abundance of epipsammon and tychoplanktonwere also included as supplementary variables.
The biomass contributions of the epipelic species
and the DGGE percentage values were used to calcu-late species richness (total number of species: SR) andthe Shannon index ( H’, Magurran 1988) according to
the program Primer 5 for Windows (ver. 5.2.2).
Microscopic count data were available for all sites
and dates, except April 2002. DGGE data for all sitesand dates were available, except B1 and B2, whichwere only for April and May 2002.
RESULTS
Site characteristics
Porewater salinity fluctuated between April 2002
and September 2003 at all 3 locations (Fig. 2A). Salin-ity was lowest in winter and early spring and highest inlate summer at all stations. Although the lowest aver-age salinities of 8.3 ± 3.5 and 9.3 ± 5.8‰ were observedat Stn A1 and A2, respectively, salinity increasedsharply to 17‰ in September 2003, probably as a resultof low riverine runoff. The salinities at B and P rangedfrom 14.4 to 29‰ in the period from April 2002 to Sep-tember 2003. There were no pronounced differences insalinity between the mid- and high-shore stations. Sur-face temperature peaked (i.e. 20 to 22°C) between Julyand September 2003, and was lowest in February 2003(4°C) at all locations (Fig. 2B). Average tidal exposureranged between 11.5 and 17.7 h d
–1, with lowest values
at B2 and highest at A1 (Fig. 2C). Sediments wererather homogeneous at all sites. They comprised alarge proportion of silty particles (average of 67.6%)with an average median grain size of about 45.3 ±27 µm and a high water content (average of 58.1%)(Fig. 2D–F). Only in February 2003 did large fluctua-tions of these variables occurred at Stns A1 and A2,during which period the silt fraction was largelywashed out. The TOC, chl a, NH
4+, NO 2–and PO 43–
peaked in spring, usually in April, at all stations
(Figs. 2G & 3A–E). While the highest average chl aand
TOC concentrations (113.4 mg m–2and 2.5%, respec-
tively) were observed at A1, B1 showed the lowestaverage chl a(53.2 mg m
–2) and P2 the lowest average
TOC values (0.9%) (Figs. 2G & 3A). NO 3–showed the
highest concentrations in February at A1 and A2; how-ever, at B1, B2 and P2 the highest NO
3–concentrations
were in March, April and May, respectively (Fig. 3B).The average NH
4+and NO 2–concentrations showed
an increasing trend toward the estuary mouth (from256Sahan et al.: Benthic eukaryotic communities in intertidal mudflats
119.6 µM at A1 to 232 µM at P2 for NH 4+and from 2.6
to 4.3 µM for NO 2–) (Fig. 3C,D). Although the average
NO 3–concentration followed the same pattern from
83.9 µM at A1 to 295.8 µM at P2, the highest averagevalue of 348.3 µM was observed at B1. PO
43–peaked at
B1 (64.2 µM), but this nutrient did not show a cleartrend among the sites, and concentrations ranged from35.5 to 47.3 µM (Fig. 3E).Morphological identification of diatoms
While a total of 158 diatom taxa were identified, only
17 epipelic diatom species reached an abundance of>5% in at least 1 sample. A complete list of these taxacan be found in Forster et al. (2006, their Fig. 2).The genus Navicula was most abundant and was rep-
resented by N. arenaria var. rostellata , N. flanatica ,257

N. gregaria , N. phyllepta and some unidentified spe-
cies. In addition, members of the genera Amphora ,
Gyrosigma and Staurophora were also present in the
samples. At none of the sites did a single species domi-nate the diatom community. N. phyllepta and N. per-
minuta were the only species found at all sites, but usu-
ally in low abundance. RDA captured about 25% of thetotal variation in the species data along the first 2 axes
(Fig. 4). The composition of epipelic diatoms appearedto be mainly related to the salinity gradient. The brack-ish sites A1 and A2, on the left-hand side of the dia-gram, were characterised by, e.g., Navicula flanatica ,
N. gregaria and Staurophora salina , while the marine

rostellata , N. microdigitoradiata and N. perminuta
(Fig. 4). Along the second RDA axis, the early springsamples (February until April) of all stations were sepa-rated from the samples taken in late spring to summer(May until September). The early spring samples werecharacterised by high chl avalues, lower diversity and
a smaller average cell size. This early spring bloom wasdominated by N. flanatica in the brackish stations A1,
A2 and B2, by Navicula sp. 13, Navicula sp. and Gyro-
sigma sp. 1 in Stn B1 and by N. arenaria var. rostellata
and Gyrosigma sp. 1 in the marine station P2. In May,
the diatom community collapsed at all stations (Figs. 3& 5), became more diverse and contained larger spe-cies. In the brackish stations, N. gregaria , N. phyllepta ,
Staurophora salina and Gyrosigma sp. 2 became domi-
nant, while at the marine sites of the estuary Amphoraspp., Navicula microdigitoradiata and Petrodictyon
gemma became important. Forward selection of the en-
vironmental variables revealed that only salinity, ni-trate and irradiance related significantly to the varia-tion in the species data. Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia andphosphate values were on average higher at the marinesites, especially during the early spring bloom.
DGGE profiles of the eukaryotic community
DGGE analysis of the 18S rRNA gene fragments
obtained by PCR amplification from the different sea-sonal samples of high- and mid-shore stations at 3 dif-ferent sites (A, B and P) yielded 43 unique bands. Thenumber of bands per sample (i.e. ‘richness’) rangedfrom 9 to 21. Although there were variations in the259

richness, there was no trend that explained the distrib-
ution of bands spatially or temporally. Out of 43 bands,18 were successfully sequenced. However, for eachsample, these sequenced bands covered 88% of thetotal band percentage values. DGGE band patterns(Fig. 5) and sequence information from excised bandsand their similarities with sequences in the ARB data-base (Ludwig et al. 2004) are shown in Table 1. Thesequences obtained were related to different taxa ofbenthic diatoms, protozoans and metazoans. The per-centage similarities with closest relatives in the ARBdatabase, especially with benthic animals, were low,and the phylogenetic affiliation of the observed bandscould not therefore be resolved below the genus levelfor diatoms or phylum level for meio- and macrofauna.
All microphytobenthic representatives in the DGGE
analysis belonged to the raphid pennate diatoms:the genera Navicula (Bands 11, 14 and 16) (Table 1,
Fig. 5), Entomoneis (including its synonym Amphi-
prora) (Bands 18 and 21), Dickieia (Band 6) and Pleuro-
sigma (Band 15), all of which have been commonly
reported from the epipelon of intertidal sediments.Given the fact that Amphiprora /Entomoneis is phylo-
genetically closely related to Amphora (Medlin &
Kaczmarska 2004), Pleurosigma to Gyrosigma (Round
et al. 1990) and Dickieia to Staurophora (Mann 1994),
it is likely that the DGGE band sequences pertainto the same dominant organisms that were observedin the cell counts. The diatom bands were all located260

Biezelingsche Ham (B) and Paulina polder (P). Similarity percentages are according to the ARB database (2004)Sahan et al.: Benthic eukaryotic communities in intertidal mudflats
at the top part of the DGGE gels, indicating a
lower melting point behaviour. Apart from 2 proto-zoan sequences, related to a ciliate (phylum Alveolata )
(Band 9) and an apusozoan flagellate (phylum Apuso-
zoa) (Band 12), all other sequences belonged to meta-
zoans related to the phyla Platyhelminthes (Bands 24,
33 and 40), Annelida (Bands 22 and 30), Arthropoda
(harpacticoid copepods) (Bands 28 and 41) and Nema-
toda (Bands 26 and 38), albeit mostly with low
sequence similarities (about 90% or below; Table 1).
RDA of the DGGE band percentages (Fig. 6) cap-
tured about 30% of the variation in the data along thefirst 2 axes. In total, 42% of the variation in the phylo-type data related significantly to the 4 environmentalvariables selected by the forward selection procedure,namely salinity, irradiance, temperature and watercontent of the sediment. As was the case for the diatomcounts, the DGGE band patterns were related to salin-ity with the brackish sites A1 and A2 on the left-hand
side of the diagram and the marine sites on the right.RDA Axis 1 was also significantly related to the watercontent of the sediment. Sequences of bands charac-teristic of the brackish sites were affiliated with thediatom genera Entomoneis (Amphiprora , cf. remark
above), Navicula , Dickieia and Pleurosigma , the cope-
pod genera Cancrincola and Tigriopus , the apusozoan
flagellate and representatives of the Plathyhelminthes .
Marine sites contained the diatom genera Navicula
and Entomoneis (Amphiprora) , a ciliate, 2 nematodes
and 1 representative of both the Annelida and Plathy-
helminthes . Similar to the results of the microscopical
counts, the second axis separated the early spring sam-ples (February, March and April), characterised by thedense diatom communities (i.e. high chl avalues), from
the other samples. This scatter was most pronounced atthe brackish sites A1 and A2, with early spring being261

characterised by several diatom taxa and the apuso-
zoan flagellate and late spring and summer samplesbeing characterised mainly by several metazoansequences (Fig. 6). Differentiation between the earlyand late spring samples at the marine site P2 was muchless pronounced (Fig. 4), which is also evident from theDGGE band patterns (Fig. 5).
In order to assess the possible effects of tidal eleva-
tion, we separately analysed the data for the Appelzaksite (the only transect for which a complete data setwas available). The difference in emersion timebetween the high- and mid-shore stations of Appelzakwas, on average, 2.5 h. This RDA analysis, which cap-tures about 40% of the DGGE band data along the first2 axes, confirmed the strong differentiation betweenthe early spring samples on the one hand and the late
spring and summer samples on the other hand (RDAAxis 1; Fig. 7). Early spring samples had higher chl a
values (diatom bloom, cf. Fig. 3) and lower salinities,and were mainly characterised by diatom and proto-zoan sequences. Metazoan organisms (meiobenthos[nematodes and copepods] and macrobenthos [anne-lids and flatworms]) were mainly characteristic of thelate spring and summer samples. Along the secondaxis, there was a clear separation between the samplesfrom the high-shore (A1) and the mid-shore (A2), withmid-shore samples having significantly higher nitritevalues. There were distinct differences in both diatomand zoobenthic compositions between both sitesthroughout the year.262

DISCUSSION
Algal biomass at the surface of intertidal sediments
in the Westerschelde varied from 5 to 292 mg chl a
m–2. These values are within the range of those pub-
lished for similar systems (e.g. Underwood &Kromkamp 1999, Goto et al. 2000). At all sites, chl a
was the highest in early spring; diatom biomassstarted to decline after April. In many studies a pro-nounced increase of biomass was recorded duringspring and summer (e.g. de Jong & de Jonge 1995,Mundree et al. 2003), but in other cases no clear sea-sonal pattern was found (e.g. Goto et al. 2000, Thorn-ton et al. 2002). The microphytobenthic biomassincreases in early spring in the Westerschelde aremainly driven by epipelic diatoms (Forster et al. 2006),confirming other studies (e.g. Underwood 1994,Underwood et al. 1998). Microscopy, PCR-DGGE andenvironmental data showed that the spring develop-ment of biofilm coincided with major shifts in thecomposition of biofilm species, the zoobenthos, aswell as the nutrient environment.
Community structure of epipelic diatoms and of
zoobenthos
Ordination analysis of the microscopical counts of
epipelic diatoms showed a pronounced relationshipbetween diatom community composition and the estu-arine salinity gradient (cf. Admiraal et al. 1984b, Under-wood 1994). Certain species appeared to be typical forthe brackish stations, e.g. Navicula flanatica , N. gre-
garia , N. phyllepta , Gyrosigma sp. 2, Stauphora salina
and Tryblionella hungarica , as they correlated nega-
tively with salinity, which was also observed in othersystems and confirmed by laboratory studies (Cox 1998,Underwood & Provot 2000). Species that were charac-teristic for the marine sites in the Westerschelde estuaryincluded, for example, Amphora spp., N. arenaria var.
rostellata , N. microdigitoradiata , N. cf. mollis and N.
perminuta . These diatoms seem to function best within
a narrow range of salinity and were classified as truemarine or salt tolerant. Hence, changes in salinity mayaffect the distribution of these organisms (e.g. Admiraalet al. 1984b, Underwood 1994). However, other studieshave indicated that diatoms may exhibit a wide toler-ance to salinity. For instance, Cox (1998) showed thatthe freshwater diatom N. gregaria grew well in seawa-
ter. However, it should be noted that, within a species,different strains may exhibit different salinity toler-ances (e.g. Cox 1995, Underwood & Provot 2000,Vanelslander et al. unpubl. data).
The ordination analysis of DGGE data was largely
congruent with that of microscopic counts and indi-cated that salinity, water content and seasonal factors
such as temperature and irradiance were associatedwith patterns in the distribution of eukaryotic organ-isms, including epipelic diatoms and micro- and meio-fauna, which is in agreement with earlier reports onthe distribution of micro-, meio- and macrobenthiccommunities in the Westerschelde (e.g. Soetaert et al.1995, Hamels et al. 2004, Ysebaert et al. 2005).
From the total of 43 DGGE bands, 18 were
sequenced, 7 of which belonged to different types ofepipelic diatoms. Using microscopy, 17 different spe-cies were found. PCR-DGGE does not detect geno-types if the abundance is <1% (e.g. Muyzer et al.1993). Hence, microscopic analysis may have a higherresolution. Using sequence similarity, diatoms couldonly be identified to the genus level and animals tothe phylum level. This was mainly due to the poor rep-resentation of 18S rRNA gene sequences in the publicdatabases. Nevertheless, the diatom count data andthe DGGE agreed well. The affiliations obtained fromDGGE sequences, Entomoneis (Amphiprora ), Pleuro-
sigma and Dickieia , are phylogenetically closely
related to Amphora (Medlin & Kaczmarska 2004),
Gyrosigma (Round et al. 1990) and Staurophora (Mann
1994), respectively. Therefore, we concluded that theDGGE bands most probably relate to the same type oforganisms as those observed by microscopy.
Analyses at the metre scale, studied at the brackish
site Appelzak, show that in addition to the seasonaleffect (RDA Axis 1, see below) there is also a strongrelationship between phylotype composition andemersion time (RDA Axis 2; Fig. 7). The compositionsin high- (A1) and mid-shore (A2) samples were differ-ent according to the elevations of the sampling sites. Inaddition, the high-shore (A1) was characterised byhigher chl a concentrations. Several other studies pin-
pointed the importance of emersion/immersion on thealgal biomass and species compositions (Oppenheim1991, Underwood 1994, Brotas et al. 1995, Goto et al.2000). Likewise, a clear relationship between exposuretimes and pigment in different brackish stations in theWesterschelde was observed by Ysebaert et al. (2005).Because the diatoms receive more light at the high-shore level, they could eventually achieve higher pro-duction. The elevation of the sampling sites may there-fore also be important for the distribution of thebenthic fauna (Ysebaert et al. 2005).
Dynamics of epipelic diatoms and of zoobenthos
The diversity, composition and size of the epipelic
diatoms varied between early spring and late spring/summer, with a pronounced shift to higher diversitywith larger types of diatoms during late spring and
263Aquat Microb Ecol 47: 253–266, 2007
summer, particularly at the marine sites. Likewise,
there was a concomitant shift in the size spectrum ofthe heterotrophs. Protozoa were only detected in theearly spring samples, while the larger sized faunalforms dominated the communities during late springand summer. Fluctuations of environmental conditionswere more pronounced in early spring, especially atthe brackish site. Hence, organisms present at thesesites during such periods need to be flexible and ableto adapt quickly to changing conditions. The morediverse community that was found during late springand summer, especially at the marine site, could be theresult of more stable environmental conditions. Like-wise, the difference in size of the prevailing diatomsmay be explained in terms of coping with the fluctua-tions in the environmental conditions in the Wester-schelde. R-types, small and fast-growing species(Snoeijs et al. 2002) using an abundance of availableresources in early spring time, are assumed to be lessspecialised than K-types, large and slow-growing spe-cies, under the limited resources that prevail in sum-mer time. Therefore, large species may respond nega-tively to fluctuations in the spring time and appearin summer under stable conditions. Moreover, thepresence of small or large species over the yearwould also be strongly affected by the type of grazers(e.g. Fenchel & Kofoed 1976, Admiraal 1977). Similarto our DGGE data, Ysebaert et al. (2005) showed thatin April the benthic community at the oligo/brackishsites was dominated by small animals, e.g., meioben-thos, copepods and nematodes, while in Septemberlarger animals, e.g., polychaeates and crustaceanswere dominant.
The RDA analysis suggests that seasonal shifts of the
epipelic diatom community are strongly influenced bylight intensity and temperature. Many studies empha-sised the correlation of chl aand changes in commu-
nity composition with irradiation (e.g. Rasmussen et al.1983, Brotas et al. 1995), although the grazer commu-nity may also have an effect (Hillebrand 2005). Lightwould most likely affect growth of the diatoms, whiletemperature may alter the activity of heterotrophs. Atlow temperature, the slow metabolism of benthic ani-mals would prevent them from taking advantage ofincreased production by diatoms. Subsequently, whentemperature increases, grazing pressure will increase,causing a breakdown of the diatom community. Simi-lar observations were made for phytoplankton commu-nities (Findlay & Watling 1998). Most of the studiesshowed that algal biomass is regulated by top-down aswell as bottom-up processes (e.g. Carpenter et al.1985, Worm et al. 2002). While grazers limit the algalstanding stock, light and nutrients regulate the bio-mass and productivity (e.g. Connor et al. 1982). Sincethe nutrients were present in excess, primary produc-tion and biomass in the Westerschelde was limited
by light (van Spaendonk et al. 1993, Kromkamp etal. 1995).
In addition to light intensity and temperature, nutri-
ent concentrations also showed differences along thesalinity gradient. Nutrient concentrations increasedduring early spring towards the mouth of the estuary.This might be related to the higher quality of organicmatter (nutrient rich) and the increased metabolicactivity of benthic animals. Among the nutrients,nitrate appeared to be particularly closely related tothe distribution of Navicula sp. and N. cf.mollis at the
marine sites. This is interesting because algae preferammonium or amino acids as nitrogen sources (e.g.Admiraal et al. 1987, Underwood et al. 1998). Moststudies focused therefore on ammonium uptake (e.g.Admiraal et al. 1984a, Underwood & Provot 2000).There are other reports showing that in nutrient-richcold environments, nitrate is preferentially taken up bydiatoms >20 µm, even in the presence of ammonium(e.g. Lomas & Gilbert 1999). Dortch (1982) showed thatnitrate was the source of new production in marinephytoplankton. These observations coincide nicelywith ours.
In summary, the community composition of diatom
biofilms in the Westerschelde was controlled by salin-ity, when the whole estuary was considered (kilometrescale), while the tidal regime was instrumental at thelocal scale in the brackish sites (metre scale). The high-est biomass of the biofilm was characterized by light inthe absence of grazers. Cell number, abundance andsize were different in early spring when the highestbiomass was present, compared to the rest of the year.The loss of biomass and shift in the species composi-tion were mainly caused by the benthic fauna, whichwas strongly influenced by the temperature andpresence of diatoms.
Microscopy together with PCR-DGGE and ordina-
tion analysis using environmental variables proved tobe a promising approach to the study of ecological andfood web interactions in biofilms of the microphyto-benthos. Although microscopy gave a more detailedview of the diatom community, it is less useful for algaethat have fewer distinguishing morphological features(e.g. cyanobacteria, green algae). The increase ofsequences of 18S rRNA genes in publicly accessibledatabases would further increase the potential of mol-ecular analyses for eukaryotic algae. The use of multi-ple primer sets could give a more representative pic-ture of the communities. Although we used the 18SrRNA gene to estimate diversity, more variable regions(e.g. the ribosomal internally transcribed spacer),group-specific primers, or certain functional genes areneeded to obtain a better resolution of the geneticdiversity.
