Abstract
A new customer and environmental friendly method of hair bound dye decolouration was developed. Biotransformation of the azo-dyes Flame
Orange and Ruby Red was studied using different oxidoreductases. The pathways of azo dye conversion by these enzymes were investigated andthe intermediates and metabolites were identiﬁed and characterised using UV–vis spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)and mass spectrometry (MS). Laccase from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus , manganese peroxidase (MnP) from Nematoloma frowardii and the novel
Agrocybe aegerita peroxidase (AaP) were found to use a similar mechanism to convert azo dyes. They N-demethylated the dyes and concomitantly
polymerized them to some extent. On the other hand the mechanism for cleavage of the azo bond by azo-reductases of Bacillus cereus and B.
subtilis was based on reduction of the azo bond at the expense of NAD(P)H.

1. Introduction
Azo dyes are widely used in industry and daily life, for
example, as components in permanent hair dyes. Additionally,azo-compounds represent the largest class of dyes applied inthe textile, food, and cosmetic industries. Azo dyes used ascomponents in permanent hair dyes can only be decolorizedby drastical methods such as chemical bleaching using hydro-gen peroxide. However, this treatment may cause hair damageand health problems. Hence, the use of these methods requiresextreme precautions in order to prevent these adverse effects.Therefore, it would be useful to develop a customer friendlyand safe treatment method avoiding the use of hazardous chem-icals. Enzymes that speciﬁcally oxidize or reduce azo-bondsand, thereby, decolorize dyed hair could be an elegant alterna-tive since they can be used under mild conditions and they donot have negative effects both on hair and skin.

E-mail address: guebitz@tugraz.at (G.M. Guebitz).Azo dyes are quite resistant to biological degradation [1]
but, nevertheless, decolorization in aerobic, anaerobic, anoxic orcombined treatment processes have been reported [2–5] . Several
mircroorganisms produce enzymes which reductively cleave theazo bond at the expense of a reducing agent, typically NAD(P)H.The occurrence of these so-called azo-reductases has beenreported for a number of bacteria. Recently, we have shown thatan azo-reductase from a thermoalkalophilic Bacillus sp. was able
to reduce a large structural variety of systematically substitutedazo dyes [6]. The non-speciﬁcity of the azo-reductase reaction
was also demonstrated in several reports on the decoloriza-tion of azo dyes by sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions[1,7,8] . It seems that almost all azo compounds tested are bio-
logically reduced under anaerobic conditions, although thereare some indications that metal-ion-containing dyes sometimeshave lower decolorization rates [9]. Cell extracts show usually
much higher rates for anaerobic reduction of azo dyes thanpreparations of resting cells do [4]. This has generally been
explained by the low permeability of the cell membranes forthe azo-compounds [10].
Azo-dyes are also degraded efﬁciently under aerobic condi-
tions by wood-rotting fungi (e. g. Phanerochaete chrysosporium,

Trametes spp.) which are in nature responsible for the degrada-
tion of lignin [11]. While fungal treatment of dye containing
efﬂuents is usually time-consuming and difﬁcult to control [2],
the potential of enzymes for this purpose has clearly beendemonstrated. The enzymes involved in the degradation of azodyes are mainly peroxidases [12] and laccases [13].
Laccases are benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases (EC
1.10.3.2) and belong to the family of blue copper proteins. Reac-tions of laccase include one-electron oxidations of phenolic andaminoaromatic substrates and can lead to reactive free radicals(e.g. phenoxyl radicals), which undergo further polymerization,depolymerization, demethylation, quinone formation and ringcleavage of aromatic compounds [14]. In a number of studies,
laccases were successfully used to decolorize different industrialdyes, thereby showing a broad substrate speciﬁcity [15–17] .
Similarly, degradation of different dyes was achieved with
crude or puriﬁed manganese peroxidase (MnP; EC 1.11.1.13)[18,19] . MnP is a heme-containing glycoprotein that requires
hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant [20]and catalyzes the cleavage
of phenolic lignin model compounds as well as of non-phenoliclignin moieties when supplied with suitable co-oxidants (redox-mediators) [21]. The activity of MnP is strictly dependent on
chelating organic acids (e.g. oxalate, malonate), H
2O2and Mn2+
[22].
In addition to MnP and laccase, other fungal enzymes could
have a potential for dye decolorization as well. Recently a novelhaloperoxidase cytochrome-P450 hybrid (AaP; EC 1.11.1.10)has been isolated the agaric basidiomycete A. aegerita . AaP
requires H
2O2to oxidize, among others, aryl alcohols into the
corresponding aldehydes and then further into benzoic acids.
In this study, we show for the ﬁrst time that two azo-
compounds used in commercially important hair dyes aresusceptible to enzymatic reduction and oxidation with concomi-tant decolorization, even when bound to hair.
2. Methods
2.1. Chemicals and enzymes
The azo dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red were supplied from CIBA and
are used as components in permanent hair dyes (see Fig. 1 ). All other chemicals
used were analytical grade and purchased from Sigma.
Manganese peroxides (MnP) of Nematoloma frowardii (speciﬁc activity
1 9Um g−1) and laccase of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (84.2 U ml−1) were pur-
chased from JenasBios GmbH (Jena, Germany). Agrocybe aegerita peroxidase
Fig. 1. Structure of Flame Orange and Ruby Red.(AaP) (80.9 U ml−1) was produced and puriﬁed as described by Ullrich et al.
[27].
The ﬂavin-containing NADH- and/or NADPH dependent oxidoreductases
ofB. subtilis YcnD and YhdA, were prepared as previously reported [24].
The azo-reductases from Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis were produced by
growing them for 12 h in 1 l bafﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂasks on a rotary shaker at160 rpm and 38
◦C in 500 ml standard I nutrient medium (Merck). Cells were har-
vested by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 ×gand the pellet was re-suspended
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (2 ml buffer per gram of wet cellpaste). Cell lysis was done with a French press (American Instrument Com-pany, Maryland, USA), performing three passes. The cell debris was removedby centrifugation at 34,000 ×gfor 60 min at 4
◦C and the supernatant was ﬁl-
tered through a preﬁlter (Glass Fiber Filter with binder, AP20, 75 mm, Millipore,Billerica, USA), a 45 /H9262m ﬁlter with pressure ﬁltration and through a Minisart
single use syringe ﬁlter sterile EO using a 0.2 /H9262m membrane (Sartorius, Han-
nover, Germany). Crude extracts were further puriﬁed by using a combinationof ammonium sulphate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography asreported by Maier et al. [6].
2.2. Enzyme assays
Assays were carried out in cuvettes with a total volume of 1 ml. One unit of
enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that transformed 1 /H9262mol
of substrate per minute (=1 unit = 1 U).
2.2.1. Assay for azo-reductase activity, YcnD and YhdA
The reaction mixture contained 400 /H9262l of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0), 200 /H9262l of the sample and 200 /H9262l of the azo dye Cibacrone Marine
(100 mg l−1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 /H9262l NADH
(7.09 mg ml−1, ﬁnal concentration 2 mM) and followed photometrically at
595 nm. The slope of the initial linear decrease of absorption was used tocalculate the enzyme activity based on the molar absorption coefﬁcient ofCibacrone Marine ( ε
595= 35.5 mmol−1cm−1) as described by Maier et al.
[6].
2.2.2. Assay for laccase activity
Laccase activity was determined using 2,2/prime-azino-di-(-3-ethylbenzo-
thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate. Five hundred microliter of50 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.0) was mixed with 430 /H9262l of distilled water and 20 /H9262l
of laccase. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 /H9262l of 6 mM ABTS and
the increase in absorbance at 436 nm was monitored. The enzyme activity wascalculated using an extinction coefﬁcient of ABTS of ε
436= 36 mmol−1cm−1
[25].
2.2.3. Assay for MnP activity
The reaction mixture contained 500 /H9262l of 50 mM sodium malonate buffer
(pH 4.5), 25 /H9262lo f2 0 m MM n C l 2solution, 415 /H9262l of distilled water and 50 /H9262l
of MnP. The reaction was started by adding 20 /H9262l1 0 m MH 2O2. The extinc-
tion of the solution was measured photometrically at the wavelength 270 nm(ε
270= 11.59 mmol−1cm−1)[26].
2.2.4. Assay for AaP activity
The activity of AaP was measured photometrically at 310 nm by monitoring
the oxidation of veratryl alcohol into veratraldehyde ( ε310= 9.3 mmol−1cm−1)
[23]. The reaction was carried out at pH 7 in 500 /H9262l potassium phosphate buffer
(50 mM), 100 /H9262l of 50 mM veratraldehyde, 370 /H9262l distilled H 2O, 20/H9262l AaP and
was started by addition of 2 mM H 2O2.
2.2.5. Dye biotransformation studies
Biotransformation of dyes was carried out in cuvettes containing 0.1 U ml−1
YcnD, YhdA or azo-reductase from crude cell extract of B. cereus and B.
subtilis , respectively, 200 /H9262gm l−1dye 7 mM NADH in 50 mM sodium phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.0). Decolorization was monitored at λmaxof the dyes. The
dyes were treated with 1 U ml−1of MnP in the presence or absence of 5 mM
Gluthation (GSH), AaP and laccases in the presence or absence of 1 mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and stirred for 1 h at 20
◦C. Controls were run
without addition of enzymes.1734 S. Pricelius et al. / Enzyme and Microbial Technology 40 (2007) 1732–1738
Decolorization of dyed hair was carried out in 1 ml Eppendorf plastic tubes on
a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) set to 35◦C. The
incubation mixture contained 5 mg of hair that was dyed with Flame Orange orRuby Red, 0.1 U ml
−1YcnD, YhdA or azo-reductase of crude cell extract from
B. cereus ,B. subtilis , 7 mM NADH (7 mM) in 1 ml 50 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0).
2.3. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass
spectrometry (MS) analyzes
Dye conversion products were separated by an HPLC system equipped with
a C18 column (Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH, Vienna, Austria) withacetonitrile and 15 mM H
3PO4,1 0m MH 2SO4and distilled water as the mobile
phase at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml min−1at 40◦C. Water was distilled twice and ﬁltered
through a 0.45 /H9262m Millipore ﬁlter and degassed prior to use.
Dionex HPLC system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) consisting of
a P580 pump, ASI-100 automated sample injector and a PDA-100 photodi-ode array detector was used with the following operating conditions: injectionvolume, 10 /H9262l; column temperature, 40
◦C; detection wavelength was chosen
according to the absorbance maxima for the azo dyes (Flame Orange: 486 nm;Ruby Red: 526 nm in addition at 210, 220 and 300 nm). The mobile phase was adegassed mixture of A, double distilled water and B, acetonitrile under isocraticconditions ranging from 8 to 25% depending on the dye.
For the detection of degradation products of Flame Orange after reductase
treatment, the mobile phase consisted of B, 14%; 10 mM H
2SO4, 50%; and 36%
of mobile phase A. For the degradation products of Ruby Red, the mobile phaseswere B, 25%; 10 mM H
2SO4, 30%; and A, 45%.
For analysis of degradation products of Flame Orange after oxidase treatment
the mobile phase consisted of B, 8%, 82% 15 mM H 3PO4and for the degradation
products of Ruby Red were detected in: B, 20%, 80% H 3PO4. UV–vis-spectra
were recorded (DAD detection) and peak heights were compared with those ofauthentic standards.
The MS analysis was done on an Agilent MSD (Waldbronn, Germany) with
direct injection using the following parameters: Drying gas temperature 350
◦C,
drying gas pressure 40 psi, drying gas ﬂow (nitrogen) 10 l min−1, capillary volt-
age 3500 V , fragmentor voltage 70 V , mass range 70–400 m/z. The data were
analyzed using the software Chemstation Rev. A 10.01 (Agilent, Waldbronn,Germany). For measurement in positive mode 0.01% acetic acid was added. Tocheck for fragments formed during the massmetry, the fragmentor voltage wasset from 25 to 150 V .
3. Results
3.1. UV–vis absorbance spectrometry and mass
spectrometry
Our studies have demonstrated that Ruby Red and Flame
Orange were completely decolorized by Ycnd, YhdA and azo-reductases prepared from Bacillus strains ( Fig. 2 ). A color
change from red to orange was observed when Ruby Redwas treated with laccase, MnP and AaP. When Flame Orangewas treated with these oxidases the color changed to pale yel-low with a hypsochromic shift of the absorbance maximumfrom 486 to 390 nm but no complete decolorization could beobserved.
Interestingly, ﬁbre bound Ruby Red and Flame Orange (dyed
human hair) were also completely decolorized as shown inFig. 3 . The spectrophotometric data were conﬁrmed by HPLC
analyzes. Complete decolorization of Flame Orange and RubyRed by YhdA, YcnD and Bacillus -derived azo-reductases lead
to several highly polar transformation products with a retentiontime of less than 1 min. The faster eluting intermediates absorbedin the UV-region. The chromatographic peaks of several target

compounds overlapped, but the gradient program could not be
optimized in such a way that it was possible to analyze interme-diates in detail. The peaks corresponding to Flame Orange andRuby Red disappeared completely indicating full conversion ofthe azo dyes under the experimental conditions (incubation for15 min with YhdA, YcnD and the azo-reductase from B. cereus
orB. subtilis ).
HPLC analysis of Ruby Red treated with laccase, MnP and
AaP indicated, that Ruby Red was transformed to extents of 15,35 and to 23.5%, respectively after 1 h and to 98, 96 and 48%after 20 h, respectively. The further analysis showed that laccase,MnP and AaP treatment of Ruby Red led to two intermediates.The highest amount of a product with retention time of 4.1 minwas seen after 20 h while this product disappeared totally after3 d. This observation led to the conclusion that the initial productwas a transient intermediate, which underwent further transfor-

mation to a ﬁnal product. Using standards, this transient product
was identiﬁed as Flame Orange.
Flame Orange was only slightly oxidized by laccase, MnP
or AaP but the conversion was considerably enhanced in thepresence of redox-mediators such as HBT or glutathione (GSH)at low concentrations as shown in Table 1 .
3.2. Mass spectrometry
To exclude the possibility of spontaneous dye conversion
during MS analysis, standards of Ruby Red and Flame Orangewere analyzed as well. The reaction products of Ruby Red withlaccase are shown in Fig. 4 and indicate that laccase is able
to demethylate the dye. One of the main degradation productshad an m/zof 231 which is subject to a second demethylation
event to give rise of a m/zpeak of 216. This m/zis iden-
tical to Flame Orange ( m/zof 216) and conﬁrms the results
from HPLC analysis (see before). The same major degradationproducts were formed when Ruby Red was treated with MnPor AaP.
Interestingly, treatment of Ruby Red with different oxi-
doreductases does not result in the same pattern degradationproducts. Thus, different degradation pathways seem to exist for
this dye depending whether laccase, MnP or AaP is used. Thesepathways, however, were not further elucidated in this studysince none of these enzymes caused the complete decolorizationof the dyes.
Reduction of azo-compounds by azo-reductases from B.
cereus and B. subtilis should lead to the corresponding aro-
matic amines [6]. Indeed, the mass spectra of the reduction
products indicated reduction of Ruby Red to the correspondingamines. As shown in Fig. 5 ,N∼1∼,N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-
benzenediamine with a molecular mass of 136 and 2-amino-1,3dimethylimidazolium with a mass of 112 were formed. WhenRuby Red was treated with azo-reductases, YhdA and YcnD, adecrease of the compounds with the m/zof 148 and 244 (the orig-
inal dye) was observed with increasing incubation time (samplestaken at 5, 10, 20, 30 s). Concomitantly, an increase of the m/z
of 112, 122 and 136 was observed. No other signiﬁcant peakwas found in the mass spectra of any of the two dyes tested, i.e.by-products were not formed at signiﬁcant concentrations in thecourse of the reaction.
When Flame Orange was treated with azo-reductases, YhdA
and YcnD, only an increase of the compound with the m/zof
112 ascribed to 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium was seen inthe course of the experiment while the amount of the degrada-tion product m/z216 (the original dye) decreased concomitantly.
The expected compound with the m/z108 (1,4-benzenediamine)
was not detected. However, as demonstrated by using a standardof 1,4-benzenediamine, this compound is not stable under theexperimental conditions (MS) and several coupling reactionscould have taken place. Azo-reductases from both B. cereus and
B. subtilis and YcnD, YhdA formed the same degradation prod-
ucts, thus it can be assumed that the reductive reactions followa similar mechanism.

4. Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that biotransformation of
the azo-hair-dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red can be achievedboth by reductases and (per)oxidases, and that a ﬁbre-bounddye is also enzymatically transformed. Several previous studieshave shown that the initial step in the biodegradation of azo-dyes under anaerobic conditions is a reductive cleavage of theazo bond at the expense of NADH or NADPH serving as electrondonors for the reaction [6,9,27,28] . This process is catalysed by
soluble cytosolic enzymes with low substrate speciﬁcity knownas azo-reductases. Molecular oxygen competes for the avail-able reducing equivalents with the azo dyes and slows down thereductive cleavage of the azo bond [29].
As previously shown for other azo dye degrading microor-
ganisms, decolorization of the azo-dyes Ruby Red and FlameOrange only occurred in the presence of NADH or NADPH asa cosubstrate. When Ruby Red was used as a target structurefor reductive cleavage, 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium andN∼1∼,N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-benzenediamine could be detected
by MS upon treatment with the puriﬁed azo-reductases, YhdAand YcnD. This clearly demonstrates that azo bond cleavageoccurs in the presence of an azo-reductase. In the case of FlameOrange, however, the products expected from reductive cleav-age could not be observed probably due to auto-oxidation ofthe 1,4-benzenediamine as previously suggested [10]. Hence,
we propose that the dye decolorizing enzymes of B. subtilis
and B. cereus convert azo dyes by cleaving the azo bond lead-
ing to the free amines. Under anoxic conditions these enzymesfacilitate the transfer of electrons via NADH to the azo dyewhich is then reduced. The hypothesis that YhdA acts as anazo-reductase that converts the dyes via the symmetric cleav-age of the azo bond (unlike laccase MnP and AaP) could beconﬁrmed by the observation of N∼1∼,N∼1∼-dimethyl-1,4-
benzenediamine and 2-amino-1,3 dimethylimidazolium, whenRuby Red was treated with YhdA. As described by Morokuttiet al. [24], azo-dyes do not enter the active site of YcnD and
reduction of the dye is mediated by free reduced Riboﬂavin 5
/prime-
monophosphate sodium salt dehydrate (FMN), which in turnis generated by NADH dependent reduction in the active siteof the enzyme. The reduction rate decreased when methylgroups as electron donating substituents were introduced intothe dye, like in Ruby Red, but the reaction pathway was thesame. Thus, earlier results obtained by Zimmermann et al.[28] were conﬁrmed that decolorization of azo dyes with azo-
reductases can be enhanced with electron withdrawing groupsat the aromatic ring, especially ortho- substitutions show this
effect [6]. Furthermore, it was reported that substrates with an
electron-negative substituent at the phenyl ring would enhancethe enzyme reaction rate. This effect may be due to the fact thate
−-withdrawing groups lead to a decreased electron density at
the N=N double bond. Hence, electron transfer to this group isreleased.
Besides reductive cleavage, it is generally assumed that
peroxidases such as MnP and AaP as well as laccases, cat-alyzing the depolymerization of lignin, are also involved inthe initial oxidation of a wide range of other recalcitrant com-pounds including different azo-dyes [19,12] . Recently it was
shown that certain MnPs and laccases can convert commercialazo-dyes, such as Reactive Black 5 [18]. The ability of these
enzymes to chemically transform such a range of organic com-pounds results from their low speciﬁcity and the involvement offree radicals. Although in this study, laccase from Pycnoporus
cinnaburinus , MnP from Nematoloma fromardii and haloperox-
idase from Agrocybe aegerita caused signiﬁcant changes in the
colour of the dyes Flame Orange and Ruby Red, they could notS. Pricelius et al. / Enzyme and Microbial Technology 40 (2007) 1732–1738 1737
decolorize them completely. Interestingly, Ruby Red was decol-
orized much faster than Flame Orange. One possible reasonfor this observation may be the lack of the slightly electron-donating effect of the two methyl groups at the nitrogen atom,which may render the molecule more susceptible towards oxi-dation by enzymes. These results conﬁrm earlier observationsreported by Chivukula and Renganathan [14] who suggested
that the azo dye has to be electron rich for oxidation by an(per)oxidase. However, an interpretation of the substrate speci-ﬁcity solely based on the molecular structure of the parentcompound may be misleading, and other effects, e.g. causedby reaction intermediates should be taken into considerationas well.
HPLC analysis of Ruby Red oxidation products indicated the
presence of two reaction products. Laccases, MnP and AaP donot only degrade the original dye but attack the formed inter-mediates as well. According to Chivukula and Renganathan[14] laccases and peroxidases appear to utilize a similar mech-
anism for azo-dye oxidation. This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed inthe present study, even though the enzymes showed differentconversion rates for Ruby Red and Flame Orange. Goszcynskiet al. [12]proposed mechanisms, in the course of which laccases
and peroxidases convert the dyes to cation radicals, being sus-ceptible to nucleophilic attack by water or hydrogen peroxide.This results in further depolymerization, repolymerization anddemethylation and ﬁnally leads to more stable intermediates. Allperoxidases tested were able to demethylate Ruby Red resultingin the formation of Flame Orange, which went through furtherspontaneous reactions.
5. Conclusion
The main interest of this study has been the development
of an enzymatic method for the irreversible decolorizationof the two azo-dyes, Flame Orange and Ruby Red, withoxidative and reductive biocatalysts. The analysis of unknownreaction products revealed the formation of two major inter-mediates in samples treated with laccase, MnP or AaP. MSanalyzes strongly indicated that these products resulted fromenzymatic N-demethylation; cleavage of the azo-bond was not
observed. The conversion mechanism of azo-reductases is likelybased on the reduction and cleavage of the azo-bond result-ing in the formation and accumulation of colourless aromaticamines. Hair bound azo dyes were also decolorized by thereductases.
