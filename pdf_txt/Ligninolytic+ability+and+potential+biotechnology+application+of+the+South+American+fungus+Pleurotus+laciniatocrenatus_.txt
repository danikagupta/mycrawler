Abstract
To get a better insight into the ligninolytic system of Grammothele subargentea , extracellular ligninolytic enzyme activities and ability to
degrade synthetic dyes as well as Eucalyptus globulus wood were assayed in cultures grown on an agar medium with Cu2+or dyes and on E.
globulus wood chips. Laccase was the only ligninolytic enzyme detected. The fungus was able to decolorize different dyes, being the highest levels
of laccase activity in cultures with Brilliant Green. Cultures on wood showed both ligninolytic activity and degradative ability on lipophilicextractives. An extracellular laccase with pI 3.5 and maximal activity at pH 4.0 and 50–55 8C was detected on liquid cultures containing 0.6 mM
Cu
2+. The enzyme extract was stable at pH 6.0–7.0 and up to 60 8C. A laccase-mediator system using a G. subargentea laccase crude extract and 1-
hydroxybenzotriazole as mediator improved the tensile strength of a paper from recycled high-kappa-number pulp.#2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Lignin is probably one of the most recalcitrant compounds
synthesized by plants, which is mostly abundant in trees and themain contributor to wood strength [1], being only degraded by a
few microorganisms. White-rot fungi mineralize lignin bymeans of complex systems made up by extracellularoxidoreductases, such as laccases and peroxidases, low-molecular-mass metabolites and active species of oxygen [2–
4]. The ability to degrade lignin and other recalcitrant
compounds such as single aromatic molecules and otherxenobiotics conﬁrms the unspeciﬁc nature of these oxidativeenzymes [5–8] . Because of this, their potential application on
areas such as pulp industry and/or bioremediation are currently
under study [4,5,8–12] . The use of fungi along with their
enzymes to degrade lignin at the industrial level should lead to areduction in manufacturing costs as well as pollution,contributing to the use of new environmentally sound bleachingsequences and the improvement of paper and related productsquality as well, such as those derived from recycled pulp[4,5,10,11,13–15] .
Among fungal extracellular oxidative enzymes involved in
lignin degradation, laccases ( p-diphenol: oxygen oxidoreduc-
tase; EC 1.10.3.2) are phenol-oxidases currently under studyfor their use in transforming aromatic compounds [2,5–7,16] .
These enzymes oxidize aromatic amines, a wide number ofphenolic compounds including chlorophenols, secondaryaliphatic polyalcohols, anthraquinone dyes and to a certainextent, some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as
anthracene, as well as some inorganic ions (like Mn

inorganic and organic metal ion complexes such as ferrocya-
nide, ferrocenes and cytochrome c or an electron itselftransferred directly from an electrode [4,5,16] . These substrates
also are oxidized by peroxidases. However, laccases, unlike
peroxidases, do not require hydrogen peroxide, raising this the
interest of biotech-companies upon them. Furthermore,laccases can participate in the production of active oxygenspecies and the oxidation of non-phenolic units of lignin, azoand indigo dyes, and other PAHs, compounds that cannot beoxidized by laccases on their own [3,5–7] . The laccase–
substrate couple constitutes the laccase-mediator system(LMS), which oxidize compounds by the laccase generated
free radicals, suggesting that LMS might have a more powerful
catalytic activity than peroxidases.
In a survey made in a subtropical area in Northern
Argentina, aimed at isolating lignin degrading organisms, ahighly active fungus, Grammothele subargentea (Speg.)
Rajch. (Stereales, Basidiomycota) strain LPSC no. 436, wasisolated and identiﬁed. It is a white-rot fungus distributed intemperate and tropical regi ons of America and East Africa
[17], that showed the highest laccase activity among several
fungi [18]. Recently, Saparrat [19] described the culture
conditions that enhanced fungal enzyme synthesis and activity.Therefore, the aim of this study was to get a better insight intothe extracellular ligninolytic system of G. subargentea by
evaluating its ability to degrade Eucalyptus globulus Labill.
wood chips as well as synthetic dyes. Furthermore, the effect ofa laccase extract from G. subargentea in a LMS using 1-
hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) as mediator upon the chemical
and physical properties of a recycled unbleached kraft pulpwas also analyzed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fungal strain
G. subargentea LPSC (culture collection of the Instituto Spegazzini, UNLP,
Argentina) strain 436 was isolated from a fruiting body collected from the trunkof a tree growing in the rain forest of a subtropical area in Garupa ´, Province of
Misiones, Argentina (27 829
0S, 55 8500W). Stock cultures were maintained on
malt extract agar supplemented with yeast extract (0.4%) and Populus nigra L.
wood chips at 4 8C.
2.2. Growth and extracellular oxidative enzyme production on agar
medium supplemented with Cu2+
The effect of Cu2+on fungal growth and synthesis of oxidative enzymes was
studied on solid media by inoculating mycelial plugs onto plates containing the
modiﬁed Czapek Dox agar (2%, w/v) basal medium [18] supplemented with
CuSO 4/C15H2O at concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM, which was the level of
Cu2+in the basal medium, to 1.8 mM. A 6-mm diameter agar plug of a culture
grown on basal medium, was used to inoculate agar plates. Three replica plates
per treatment were incubated in the dark at 25 /C61.5 8C. The effect of Cu2+on
growth was estimated after 7 days of incubation, calculating the percentage ofreduction in colony diameter in response to the media Cu content, as described
by Saparrat and Hammer [20]. Ligninolytic enzyme activity was determined
after a 7-day incubation period in extracts obtained from the culture mediumareas beneath the mycelium [21]. The data were analyzed by a one-way
ANOVA and means were contrasted by Tukey’s test. Linear regressions were
performed using STATGRAPHICS Plus Version 4 software for Windows(Microsoft, USA).2.3. Extracellular enzyme production and decolorization on agar-dye
medium
The ability of G. subargentea to decolorize synthetic dyes supplemented to
the modiﬁed Czapek Dox agar (2%, w/v) basal medium was evaluated. A total
of 12 synthetic dyes (0.01%, w/v) representing azo, heterocyclic and triphe-nylmethane groups were tested ( Table 1 ). One percent stock solutions of the
dyes were sterilized by ﬁltration and added to autoclaved basal medium. Bengal
Rose, Brilliant Green, Congo Red were from Fluka. Crystal Violet, Eosin Y ,
Fuchsin, Methylene Blue B, Methyl Red and Phloxine were from E. Merck.Neutral red was obtained from Riedel-de Haen. Toluidine Blue was purchased
from Anedra. Trypan Blue was from Sigma Chemical. Three replicates per
treatment were inoculated and incubated as described before. The scale usedwas: (1) plates decolorized after 7 days of incubation; (2) plates decolorizedafter 14 days; (3) plates decolorized after 21 days; (4) no decolorization. Colony
size and oxidative enzyme activity were determined as described before after 7
and 21 days of incubation.
2.4. Solid-state fermentation (SSF)
G. subargentea LPSC strain 436 was cultivated in 100 ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
containing 2 g (dry mass) of E. globulus wood chips (1–2 mm /C210–20 mm) in
5 ml water, which were sterilized twice at 121 8C for 30 min. Two mycelium
plugs (6 mm diameter) from 2% malt extract agar cultures were added asinoculum. Six replicates of inoculated and uninoculated control ﬂasks were
incubated at 25 /C61.5 8C. Ligninolytic enzyme activity (expressed as mU/g
wood) was evaluated on each of three ﬂasks after 15 and 30 days of incubation.Enzyme extracts were prepared as described by Saparrat and Guille ´n[8]. Wood
mass loss and degradation of Klason lignin, lipophilic compounds and free and
esteriﬁed sterols of eucalypt wood were determined on the three remaining
replicates. Wood dry mass was measured by weighing the ﬂasks content afterdrying them in an aerated oven at 60 /C658C for 12 h. Lipophilic compounds
were extracted from sawdust ( <0.4 mm) in a Soxhlet using acetone as solvent
and the extracts were dried for mass estimation [9]. Chromatographic analysis
of acetone extracts was carried out according to Martı ´nez et al. [9]. The Klason
lignin content was determined according to TAPPI Standard T222 om-88 [22].
Degradation of free and esteriﬁed sterols was quantiﬁed by estimating the
difference between lipophilic compounds after a 15- and 30-day incubationperiod in uninoculated controls and in wood inoculated with the fungus.
2.5. Enzyme assays
Unless otherwise stated, laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) activity was measured using
as substrate 5 mM 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP, Fluka) in 0.1 M sodium tartrate
buffer, pH 4 at 25 8C[7]. Aryl-alcohol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.7), lignin peroxidase
(EC 1.11.1.14), manganese-dependent peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.13) and manga-
nese-independent peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) activities were determined as
described by Saparrat and Guille ´n[8]. One activity unit (U) was deﬁned as
the amount of enzyme releasing 1 mmol reaction product/min.
2.6. Preparation and characterization of a crude extract with laccase
activity of G. subargentea
The fungus was grown for 20 incubation days in the modiﬁed Czapek Dox
liquid medium supplemented with 0.6 mM Cu2+at third incubation day [19].
Then the mycelium was removed by centrifugation at 20 000 /C2gand 4 8C for
10 min. The supernatant was collected and concentrated by using an Amiconultraﬁltration cell (model 8050) equipped with a PM10 Diaﬂo ultraﬁlter (cut-off10 kDa) to achieve a 7.6-fold concentration factor for laccase. Then, the crude
extract was fractionated and conserved at /C0208C. pH and temperature effects
on enzyme stability were estimated by preincubating crude extracts at pHsbetween 2.0 and 7.0 and temperatures ranging between 40 and 70 8C for 1, 24
and 48 h and 0–4 h, respectively, measuring enzyme activity as described
before. The effect of the pH and temperature in the catalytic activity of laccasewas assayed by performing the reaction at pHs and temperatures rangingbetween pH 2.0–7.0 and 22–55 8C, respectively. The effect of ionic strength
on laccase activity was evaluated at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 1 M.M.C.N. Saparrat et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 368–375 369Author's personal copy
Proteins were precipitated by adding to crude extracts 5 volumes of acetone,
then were pelleted by centrifugation (10 000 /C2gfor 15 min), and the pellets
were redissolved in deionized water. The whole procedure was repeated onetime and proteins were pooled. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an
immobilized pH gradient on 5% polyacrylamide gels (1 mm thickness) at pIs
ranging from 3.0 to 10.0 (Bio-Rad Ampholine) in a mini IEF cell (Model 111,Bio-Rad) at: 100 V for 15 min, 200 V for the following 15 min, and 450 V for
the last 60 min. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-
250. Bands with laccase activity were revealed by incubating the gel in 0.1 Msodium tartrate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 5 mM DMP.
2.7. Effect of the G. subargentea laccase extract–HBT system on the
properties of a recycled pulp
Virgin softwood kraft pulp, which is a mixture of Pinus elliotti andPinus
taeda (kappa number 85.0, Canadian standard freeness (CSF) 810 ml, sup-
plied by Papel Misionero S.A., Misiones, Argentina), was reﬁned in a PFI mill
at 20,000 revolutions in two steps using a 1.8 N/mm load (ﬁnal freeness:
640 ml CSF). Handsheets of 214 g/m2were made, dried under tension
according to the SCAN-P 2:75 Test Method [23], repulped according to
Mocchiutti et al. [10] and classiﬁed using a Bauer–McNett classiﬁer accord-
ing to the SCAN-M6:69 Test Method [23]. The only fraction collected, R30,
was treated with HCl 0.1 M at 4% pulp consistency (4 g dry pulp/100 g ofsuspension) during 45 min, was washed with distilled water until a pH of 4.5
and was stored at 4 8C.
An aliquot of supernatants from 20 days old liquid cultures of G. sub-
argentea LPSC no. 436 strain with laccase activity (at a dosage of 350 mU lac-
case activity/g dry pulp using guaiacol as substrate according to Guille ´n et al.
[24]) and a solution of HBT mediator (1-hydroxybenzotriazole, monohydrate;
ICN Biomedicals; 3% on dry pulp) were used to treat a pulp suspension at 2%consistency. The mixture was incubated at pH 4.5 (adjusted with 55 mM sodiumacetate buffer) and 40 /C618C. Oxygen was incorporated by agitation (200 rpm)
and by bubling it under atmospheric pressure for 4.5 h. Laccase activity was
assayed at 20 min intervals and when reduction in activity level was observed anadditional aliquot of the enzyme was added. Three controls were run, one withno enzyme and HBT, another that had only enzyme and a third one that had only
HBT. The enzyme adsorbed onto the pulps was released by treating them with0.1% Tween 20 (T) for 30 min. Then the pulps were ﬁltered and washed until noenzyme activity was detected on the supernatant. Then, an alkaline extraction
(AE) of the solid residue was performed at 7% pulp consistency, using 2%
NaOH on dry pulp at 70 /C618C for 30 min. The kappa number [25], total acidic
groups [26]and water retention value in the calcium form (3000 /C2g; 15 min) of
the treated pulps were determined. Handsheets with a grammage of 60 g/m
2
were prepared according to the SCAN-C 26:76 Test Method [23] to determine
the tensile index [25], apparent density [25], light-scattering coefﬁcient ‘‘ s’’
(using a R68 ﬁlter; effective wavelength of 681 nm) and speciﬁc light absorp-
tion coefﬁcient ‘‘ k’’ at 681 nm, which was determined according to Kubelka–
Munk theory [27]. Three up to 10 measurements were taken for each pulp
properties after different treatment sequences. Results were analyzed by a one-way ANOV A and means of all variables were contrasted by Tukey’s test
(P= 0.05) [28].
3. Results
3.1. Growth and extracellular oxidative enzyme production
on agar medium supplemented with Cu2+
Copper inhibited growth of G. subargentea . There is a linear
relationship between the Cu content in the media andfungal growth inhibition ( R
2: 0.98; % growth reduc-
tion = 0.0193 /C2mMC u2++ 0.815). The largest reduction
(35.4%) occurred at a concentration of 1.8 mM. Regarding
the extracellular activity of aryl-alcohol oxidase, laccase and
peroxidase enzymes, only laccase activity was detected and itslevels increased together with the amount of Cu
2+in the media,
though the highest enzyme activity (302 mU/cm3of agar
medium) was found at 1.5 mM Cu2+.Table 1

3.2. Extracellular enzyme production and decolorization
on agar-dye medium
The ability of the strain to grow, produce extracellular
oxidative enzymes and metabolize chromophores was alsoevaluated ( Table 1 ). Along a 21-day period, the fungus grew in
the presence of dyes which were all metabolized except for
Methylene Blue B. The largest growth reduction (85–90%)
after 7 days of incubation was provoked by media supple-mented with triphenylmethane dyes, such as Brilliant Green orCrystal Violet. Only one O-heterocyclic dye, Bengal Rose,
provoked as much as a 50% reduction in growth in 7 days.Laccase activity was detected in both decolorized and non-decolorized areas close to the mycelium and while the highestactivity was detected in cultures supplemented with Brilliant
Green, no aryl-alcohol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes
activities were found ( Table 1 ).
3.3. Solid-state fermentation (SSF)
Laccase activity in solid-state fermentation (SSF) cultures of
the fungus and the degradation of E. globulus wood
components are shown in Table 2 . While no aryl-alcohol
oxidase and peroxidase activity was detected in SSF extracts(data not shown), the fungus degraded E. globulus wood mass
by 5.5 and 8.2% after 15 and 30 days of incubation,respectively, also reducing the level of lignin and totallipophilic compounds, including free and esteriﬁed sterols
(Table 2 ).
3.4. Characterization of a crude extract with laccase
activity of G. subargentea
Crude extracellular extracts of G. subargentea cultures
grown on medium supplemented with copper were character-ized. While the enzyme-complex was completely stable for48 h within a pH range 6.0–7.0 at 25 8C, at pH 4.0–5.0 there
was a 35–40% reduction in activity ( Fig. 1 A). Shorter
incubations at low pH also affected enzyme stability, since
incubation for 1 h at pH 2.0 provoked a 50% reduction inactivity.
Zymograms obtained after IEF of the crude extract, which
was obtained from liquid cultures, showed that laccase activitywas concentrated on a band that had a pI 3.5 ( Fig. 2 ).
Although laccase activity spanned along a broad pH range
(pH 2–6), when 100 mM sodium tartrate (2.0–7.0) was used as
reaction buffer, the highest levels of activity were detected at
pH 4.0 ( Fig. 1 B).
Pre-incubation of the enzyme extract at 40–50 8C for 4 h
resulted in a considerable increment in activity (150%).However, at 70 8C it’s half-life was only 1 h, and after 4 h only
8% of activity remained. The enzyme was stable at 60 8C
(Fig. 3 A), and in accordance with this the highest laccase
activity occurred at incubation temperatures between 50 andTable 2

tested by preincubating enzyme extracts at the desired pH for 1 h (squares), 24 h (circles) and 48 h (triangles). Laccase enzyme activity was determine d using 100 mM
sodium tartrate buffer at pH between 2.0 and 7.0.M.C.N. Saparrat et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 368–375 371Author's personal copy
558C, though it remained at high levels at temperatures
between 22 and 55 8C(Fig. 3 B).
Ionic strength also affected laccase activity. Though pre-
incubation of the enzyme extract in 0.1 M of NaCl did not alter
activity, it was reduced by approximately 71% with 1 M NaCl(data not shown).
3.5. Effect of the G. subargentea laccase extract–HBT
system on the properties of a recycled pulp
We analyzed the chemical and physical properties of a pulp
after treating it with a laccase crude extract in a LMS.Treatment with laccase extract alone had the same effect thanthe C-T-AE sequence (data not shown). The EH-T-AE sequenceincreased the paper tensile index by 8.0 and 11.7% compared tothe H-T-AE and C-T-AE sequences, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). The
light-scattering coefﬁcient of the pulp and its apparent density,after EH-T-AE sequence and those of the pulp treated only withHBT (H-T-AE sequence) were similar though signiﬁcantly
different from untreated control pulp ( P<0.05). Other
characteristics such as kappa number, water retention andtotal content of acid groups remained unchanged. However, asevidenced by the k-coefﬁcient, the pulp treated with laccase
extract–HBT was darker than the others ( P<0.05), which
might be due to the oxidation of the pulps components treatedwith LMS.
4. Discussion
Previous studies have shown that G. subargentea produce
low levels of extracellular manganese-dependent peroxidase
activity on phenol red [18]. Saparrat [19] suggested that this
was due to a laccase activity. Here we conﬁrmed thatextracellular laccase was the only enzyme detected by G.
subargentea under the conditions studied, since it’s activity was
associated to a single acidic protein, like in Coriolopsis rigida
[7],Lentinula edodes [6]andPycnoporus cinnabarinus [29].
As described before by Saparrat [19], the enzyme activity was
induced by Cu, increasing in direct relation with concentration
until 1.5 mM. While Saparrat [19] evaluated the enzyme
response to Cu
2+in liquid media, we did so on solid media.
Therefore, the differences found might be due to the fact thatagar sequestered copper. Two evidences support this, one is thatagar is known to complex a variety of metal ions [30–32] and
the other one is that a higher Cu
2+concentration was required in
solid media to produce as much enzyme as in liquid medium.Bollag and Leonowicz [33], Levin et al. [34] and Saparrat et al.
[7]found that laccase was the major extracellular protein
fraction in fungal cultures supplemented with several inducers,including copper. Furthermore, Collins and Dobson [35] and
Palmieri et al. [36] found that laccase expression of
Basidiomycetes is induced by Cu at a transcriptional level.
G. subargentea growth was not fully inhibited by the dyes,
which were decolorized as a result of biotransformation and/or

determined at 50 8C.M.C.N. Saparrat et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 368–375 372Author's personal copy
mycelial adsorption [20,37] . The mycelium of G. subargentea
was white when grown on dye supplemented media andextracellular laccase activity was found mainly in decolorizedareas. Calvo et al. [38], Eichlerova ´et al. [39], Pointing et al.
[40] and Revankar and Lele [12] found that the oxidative
activity of white-rot Basidiomycetes transformed a broadspectrum of chromophores. A similar pattern was observed in
G. subargentea , which could not transform Methylene Blue B.
G. subargentea degraded lignin and lipophilic compounds
from E. globulus wood, including free and esteriﬁed sterols,
which are the main compounds responsible for ‘‘pitch’’deposition in pulp and paper manufacture. Lipophiliccompounds are composed mainly of byproducts, woodconstituents and also of fungal metabolites synthesized alongthe incubation period [9]. The lower level of degradation of
lipophilic compounds by G. subargentea after a longer
incubation period, such as 30 days, could be due to an increasein low-molecular-mass compounds as a result of lignindegradation. Similar results were found when Bjerkandera
adusta was cultivated on E. globulus wood under SSF
conditions [9]. The concomitant laccase activity and E.
globulus wood degradation in culture, suggest a role for the
enzyme complex in degradation. Furthermore, in fungi lacking
peroxidase activity, laccase might play one of the most relevant
roles in lignin biodegradation [4,29] . Several fungal species,
including Marasmius quercophilus ,Pleurotus eryngii and P.
laciniatocrenatus , degrade lignin by means of the participation
of laccases [8,16,41] . These oxidative enzymes along with
others such as esterases, also are involved in the transformationof lipophilic extractives of E. globulus wood [11].
Crude extracellular extracts from liquid cultures of the
fungus were analyzed and characterized. The enzyme pI,
optimum pH and temperature range were determined togetherwith the ionic strength effect on enzyme stability and activity,which by the way were similar to those of other isolatedlaccases [2,4,33] . The laccase crude extract from G.
subargentea was highly stable to high temperature comparedto laccases from Pleurotus eryngii [16],P . cinnabarinus [29],
Thelephora terrestris [42] andTrametes trogii [34]. Further-
more, pre-incubation of the enzyme extract at 40–60 8C
increased the level of activity, in a way similar to the laccaseisolated from Chaetomium thermophilium [43]. This type of
response to preincubation can be due to conformationalchanges, that might increase ﬂexibility, hence, the catalytic
activity of the enzyme. This has been described for the
carboxylesterase of the extremely thermoacidophilic archaeonSulfolobus solfataricus as a response to temperature and
cosolvents [44]. Dawson et al. [45] and Taniguchi et al. [46]
suggested that conformational changes in metalloproteins, such
as cytochrome c and laccases, can lead to more efﬁcientelectron transfer rates in reactions involving those proteins.Other laccases such as those of the basidiomycete PM1 and
Polyporus versicolor were activated by temperature [46,47] .
Since G. subargentea was isolated from a subtropical area, it is
not surprising the stability of its laccase to high temperatures,though the ecological role of this remains to be determined.
Recently da Silva et al. [48] reported the effect of the
Trametes hirsuta laccase extract/HBT system on the chemical
composition and strength properties of the ﬁbrous fraction of anunbleached recycled softwood kraft pulp. However, not much is
known about recycling of unbleached pulps and its modiﬁca-
tion by treatment sequences involving enzyme preparationssuch as one with laccases from G. subargentea [49]. The G.
subargentea laccase extract/HBT system did not deligniﬁed the
pulp efﬁciently, however its activity increased the tensile indexand the k-coefﬁcient of the pulp. The chemical modiﬁcations of
pulp-lignin provoked by the G. subargentea laccase extract/
HBT system, due to the production of radicals, quinones and
other polar compounds, might make lignin more hydrophilic
and likely to polymerize with the surfaces of adjacent ﬁbers,leading this to an increase in ﬁber bonding capacity. Lund andFelby [50] suggested that oxidized lignin can undergo
polymerization, which may act as a wet-strength agent ofpaper by encapsulation of the ﬁbers in the sheet. Therefore, our

results suggest that the LMS using a G. subargentea laccase
extract, oxidized lignin to higher levels than controls, whichleads to higher levels of chromophores. Chakar and Ragauskas[51] and Wong et al. [15] found that lignin containing pulps
developed, as a result of LMS activity, chromophores, which
are mainly aromatic ketones, including quinones of oxidizedlignin [50]. Speciﬁc modiﬁcations of lignin from recycled high-
kappa-number pulps may be a way of improving theirpapermaking properties [49,52] . It has already been shown
that LMS is an efﬁcient system for demethylation anddeligniﬁcation of kraft pulp, transformation of PAHs,decolorization of synthetic dyes and wet-strength improvement
of unbleached kraft pulp [5,6,50,51] .
5. Conclusions
The ability of the G. subargentea LPSC 436 strain to
degrade lignin of E. globulus wood, its resistance to the
inhibitory action of synthetic dyes and its ability to decolorize
different chromophore types, as well as the improvement in the
strength properties of a recycled high-kappa-number pulp aftertreating it with a G. subargentea laccase extract/HBT system,
suggest that this fungus might be a useful tool in thebiotechnology ﬁeld such as the pulp industry and bioremedia-tion.
