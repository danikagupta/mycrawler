-------------------··--------------------------------------------This memorandum provides a diacuaaion of several factors affecting the 
regulatory action that might be taken In regard to P1rke·D1vl1' pending 
NOA 20-450 for Cerebyx• [fosphenytoln). 
Several options, ranging from approval to disapproval are defensible. Aa a 
matter uf tactics, how•tvar, the action latter being forwarded declares the 
NOA approvabl1, albeit under a number of condition• that are enumerated 
both within the text of the letter and within a veraton of product labeling 
"Jveloped by the dh''tlon (I.e., In 'not•• to the firm' embedded within the 
text) that would be attached to the letter, If Issued. If tt. :t Office were to 
choose an alternative notion, the draft approvable letter may be modified 
accordingly.

Although Cerebyx• [fo1phanytoln] 11 a new chemical entity, an approval of 
the NOA tor Cerabyx• le only po11lble, given the type of the Information 
provided In the NOA, becau•• ouantln•, Park• Davit' Innovator brand of 
phenytoin, is an approved anti-eplleptlc drug product (AEDJ. Leber: Cerebyx~ [phosphenytoln Injection] approvable action ... page 2 
The conclusion that Cerebyx• is effective In use, in particular, tuma not 
on reports of adequate and well controlled clinical inve1tlgatlon1, but 
upon 1) the knowledge that phenytoin Is an effeotlvft AED, 2) that 
fosphanytoln ls completely converted within minute• of Injection to 
phenytotn and 3) evidence adduced by the sponsor In blopharmacoklnetlc 
and clinical trials showing that when Cerebyx• is administered under the 
directions provided Ir, the proposed Cerebyx• product labeflng, the 
resulting plasma levttla of phenytoln approximate thoae that are obtained 
when Dllantln Injection ts administered under Its recommended conditions 
of uae for the same claimed use. 
Although the agency's earlier determination that the benefits of DUanUn• 
Injection outweigh the rlake of lta u11 11 a nece11ary element In the chain 
of argument and evidence that can be used to support a conclualon that 
Cerebyx• wllt be safe for us• under lta proposed labeling, the 
determination Involving Dtlanttn• ta, In and of lt11lf, Insufficient to 
support the ooncluslon about Certbyx•·a safety. Not only le fosphenytoln 
a different molecular 1p1cl11 than phenytoln (and, therefore, may poae an 
entirely distinct panoply of risks unrelated to lte oonverelon to 
phenytoln). but foaphenytoln Injection yields two/three molecular 
species, ph<•aphate and formaldehydt/f ormate that are not produced when 
Ollantln la administered. How theae difference• affect the regulatory 
dectston, and how well I belteve they have been addressed by the ft rm. are 
dl1cu1sed tn a later section of thle memor1ndum. ------- -- - ------ -- -- - --

Cerebyx• labeling can be viewed 11 addr111lng both toaphenytoln specific 
(e.g., toephenytoln, formate, phosphate) and ph1nytoln related l11ue1. The 
latter, to the extent that they repreaent Inf ormatlon not currently 
included In Ollantln• labeling poae a problem In that, with the marketing 
of Carebyx•, there would be In exlatance dlff erent, arguably 
contradictory, statements about the same drug 1ub1tance (phenyt,,tn) In 
the labeling of two different approved drug products (Dllantln• anj 
Cerebyx•). 
While we do not propose to r1101ve the problem by linking the approval of Leber: Cerebyxtt [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 3 ... 
the Cerebyx• NOA to full revision of Dliantln• product labeUng, we do 
recommend, If the Cerebyxe NOA Is declared approvable, asking the firm 
to revise the content of those sections of Dllanttns product laboUng (both 
oral ard Injectable) that differ substantively from Cerebyx• product 
labeling (e.g., phenytoin specific matters via a vis pregnancy, 
taratogenlclty, etc.) and to submit labeHng supplements to an1 their 
Dllantln product NDAs at the same time as they make a response to a 
Cerabyx• approvable action letter. 
1ll1,atly10111 ID U••· 
As noted in the preceding section, although the Cerebyx• NOA contain• no 
reports of adequate and well controlled cllnloal lnve1tlgatlon1 that 
document fosphenytoln Injection's capacity to 1uppre11 seizures, the 
offacUveneaa of the product •• an anti-epileptic drug [AEOJ can be deemed 
established on the ground• that 1 ) fo1ph1nytoin ta a prodrug for phenytolnl 
and 2) under the conditions of use recommended in the labeling propo11d 
by the Dlvlalon, Cerebyx• Injection will yield plaam& levels of tree 
pnenytotn that are aufflclently cloae3 to those that would be produced 
' The firm might not choose to revise DUantin• injection becauH they 
intend that it be replaced by Cerebyxe; I would recommend that we insist that they 
do, however, in part to ensure that generic labelirag for injectable phenytoin is 
consistent with Cerebyx•. 
2 Each molar unit of administered fospheytoin is converted to an equimolar 
qu.,.ntity of phenytoin. 
3 It is acknowledged that 'close' haa no clinically defined or generally 
rtcognized meaning. The woid is intended to convey a judgment by the review 
team that the rate and extent of free phenytoin delivery to the 1y1temic circulation 
that follows the admini1tration of Cerebyx® do not differ from the rate and extent of 
tree phenytoin delivery that follow• the administration of Ollantin® injection to a 
degree that will a cau1e a clinically significant difference in treatment response. This 
judgment, admittedly, cannot be supported by reference to tmpiriral findings; there 
is no e1tabli1hed quantitative relationahip between chana•• ln the rate and extent of 
phenytoin delivery and change• in the percent of patients exptrienclns a aatiafactory 
anti-epileptic response in any of the clinical 11tting1 in which parenteral phenytoin 
is recommended. While auch a judgment ia, therefore, undeniably arbitrary, it is Leber: Cerebyx• [phosgt)enytoln Injection] approvabla action page 4 
when Dllflntln• Injection is administered for the same lndlcation4 under 
Dllantln• Injection's recommended conditions for use to allow Cerebyx• 
Injection to be uaed tn place of Dilantin.• injection. 
As noted, the bloequlvalence of Cerabyx• and DUantin• Injection have not 
been demonstrated under every possible aet of doses and routes of 
administration being recommended In Carebyx• labeling. It Is our 
judgment, however, that the products are 1funglble1 when given In 
equimolar doses In settings where the extent, but not the rate, of 
phanytc,ln delivery controls Its affectlven•ss. 
In thft one situation in which rate of phanytoln availability is deemed of 
crltlcal cllnlcal Importance, that la, Intravenous loading for the treatment 
of 1tatu11 aplleptlcua, the firm has been able to develop a regimen of use 
under which the pharmacoklnatlc parfonnanca of Carabyx• and Ollantln• 
injection are bloequlvalent by ordinary agency criteria (I.e., the 90% CL 
llmlta on the ratio of the realized values of the estimates for the usual PK 
parameters of the new to the old product are ~ 0.8 and s 1.2S). 
A digression concerning the doses of phenytoin and fosphenytoin studied 
may be helpful at this point. The molecular weight of fo1phenytoin is 
approximately 1.5 times that of phenytoin; accordingly a dose of phenytoin 
only 0.67 that of fosphenytoin is equimolar to the latter. Unfortunately, it is 
sometimes difficult to be certain whether or not the dose of fosphenytoin 
every bit as reasonable a1 the one that allows the agency to declare products that 
differ in their biopharmacokinetic performance 'bioequivalent' as long as the 
difference in their performance falls within some arbitrary tolerance limits (e.g., the 
90% confidence limita on the ratio of realized estimates for a particular 
pharmacokinetic parameter, say Cmax or AUC, for two products, falls between 0.8 
and 1.25). Having aaid all this, however, it should be noted that the firm did show 
that fosphenytoin and phenytoin can deliver free phenytoin to the same rate and 
extent under ontt specific set conditions of dose and rate of administration. (see 
discuuion of atudy 982-240).

Aleo, •inc• the metabollem of formate 11 folate dependent, and a 
substantive proportion of pattenta with 1tatu1 eplleptlcua may be folate 
deficient (1.g., alcohollca), the l11ue 11 not only the extent of monitored 
expertenca, but the collateral condltlona under which exposure has taken 
place. 
The rl1k 111111m1nt proce11 11 further complicated by the 1par1ena11 of 
the information available from precllnloal models. At present, we 
believe (know) that expoaurea 11 tow 7 MMOUL can cauae ocular damage tn 
monkey•, but do not know whether or not lower expo1ure1 can. 
On the other hand, Dr. Fl1h1r point• out that 1u1talned expo1ur11 to

and that the firm did estimate, b111d on data avallable from other 
1ouro11, the likely lncr1m1nt In 11rum formate that would follow an 
Inf u11on of formate equivalent to that deUvered by the maximum 
recommended doae of foaphenytoln, and that 1uch an Input would be 
unlikely to raise formate le vela above backpround, let alone produce tho•• 
known to cau1e Injury. 
Accordingly, In my view, conc1m1 about formate are not of a oonoem vie a 
via the approvablllty of Cerebyx, although they probably require mention In 
labeling, unleaa the firm can provide either argument or data, or both to 
convince us such mention la unnec111ary. 
Bl•kl gt 1 gbo1pb1te load. 
Dr. Feeney draws attention to the rt1k1 that might follow rapid IV 
admtntatratton of a pho1phat1 load. Both 11rum Ionized calcium l1v111 
and pH may be affected, but neither have been 1y1tematlcally monitored by 
the 1pon1or. Al with the concern• dl1cu111d In regard to formate, I 
believe we ought to require mention of th• po11tblllty of th••• eff1ot1 in 
l1b1llng unl111 the 1pon1or can provide evidence or argument to 1how that Labor: Cerebyxt> [phosphenytoin injection) approvabla action ... page 10 
such labeling statement& are unnecessary. 
Systemic sensations 
In his review, Dr. Feeney discusses a set of 1enaatton1 that are associated 
with Infusion of Cerebyx (burnlng/prurltu1 affecting the extremities, the 
groin and In part-rectal araaao): aince th••• are not observed with 
phenytoln Infusion, it la logical that they are the r11ult of aome unique 
property of fosphenytoln, ite byproducts, or some 1econdary phenomena 
arising from their Introduction Into the 1y1temlc clrculatton. 
Phosphate, for example, might act directly or Indirectly through an effect 
on serum Calcium levela. The u1ual 1lgns/1ymptom1 of tetany (pert-oral 
dyatheslas, tingling In the distal extremities, etc.), however, do seem 
dl1tlngui1hable from tho•• 111octated with foaphenytoln lnfu1lon; 
nonetheleaa, the pcsslblllty that changes In serum Calcium are 'nvolved 
cannot be dismissed out-of·hand. 
The bottom line, however, la that our ability to 111e11 any hypothe1l1 
regarding the cau1e of th••• phenomena 11 limited by the mlnlmal 
monitoring of aerum formate, Calcium, pho1phate and pH done by the firm. 
Eatalltiu 
The population treated with fo1phenytoin 11 likely to be at 1ub1t1nttally 
greater risk of death than the typical cohort of patients with complex 
partial seizures who participate ln the usual AED development program. In 
particular, the foaphenytoln cohort Includes patients In status, those with 
head trauma, etc, and aa a consequence la a cohort In which deaths, 
r1gardl111 of treatmetit, are expected. 
Accordingly, I am not concemed about the number of deaths reported In 
e Dr. Feeney writes that "the character and location of the HNOry 
disturbance described for Decadron and Hydrocortisone matchea the dominant 
description in Cerebyx-treated subjects. With all 3 agents, patients deacribe a burning 
or itching which localizes primarily to the groin area." Labar: Carebyx• [phosphenytoin Injection] approvable action 
... I page 11 
association with the use of fosphenytotn. Thia Judgment, however, la 
defended only by my personal intuition, no more, no less. 
Safety and. Common AQBs 
This ts largely a labeling display taaua. The firm has studied Cerebyx® 
over a number of disparate conditions ln different patient populations. It 
makes no sense In my view, to combine these experiences In an effort to 
provide a single, overall, table of untoward clinical event Incidence. 
tnatead, It makes far more sense to present the Incidence within the 
various settings. We instruct the firm, within the text of labeling, how 
best to accomplish this goal. 
Safety In Chlldraa 
This important age group has not been evaluated; It approved, Cerebyx® la 
llkaly to be used In children, yet we do not have informatlon on their 
handling of the product. 
l1t1tr lo U11-overall c11n1ld1r1tlon1: 
The extent of ctlnlcal experience with an lnveatlgatlonal drug, the degree 
to which that experience Is representative of the condttlone under which 
the drug will be used If marketed, and the quality and kind of patient 
monitoring during the drug's cllnicat testing determine the strength and 
vall•e of any warrant that may be ottered about the sat ety of a drug at the 
time of ita approval. 
Obviously, the fewer the number of patients expo1ed, the leas re II able any 
warrant about the drug: this applies both to rtska that were and those that 
were not observed during the product's pre-marketing development. 
Thia generic caveat appllea to any regulatory conclualon that a drug 11 
•safe for use;' but It 11 e1peclally appllcabla where Cerebyx~ la concerned. 
First, because this product has been administered to relatively few 
lndlvlduala overall. The total numbers of subjects exposed are 
enumerated in the following table: Leber: Cerebyx• (phoaphenytoln injection] approvable action page 12 ....

Of greater concern, Cerebyx• has been administered to even fewer under 
conditions of use where it la expected to cause the greatest number of 
problems: hlgh rate intravenous infusion. Spaclflcally, aa of the last 
safety update, only 128 patients had boon expoaad to dpae1 t:1 !S mg PE/kg

Whether or not this extent of cllnlcal teatlng provide• an adequate baala 
to allow the markeUng of Cerebyx• under th••• condtuona 11 a 
determination that tu ms on personal Judgment, and, the ref ore, ultimately, 
the personal judgment of the agency official who has the delegated 
authority to act on the question, In this caae, the Office Director. 
Dl1cu11lpn pf Optlop1 
Although the evidence provided by the sponsor is probably sufficient to 
allow some expert eplleptologlate to reach, reaponaibly. a conclusion that 
Cerebyx• has been shown to be safe for use under high dose, high rate 
condltlona of uae recommended In it• propoaed labeling, I cannot know 
whether most, or even a majority of experts, would re&ch the same 
conclusion. 
Accordingly, the division has prepared an approval action letter becau11 It 
believes such an action can be defended. although It la not nece111rlly the Leber: Cerebyx• [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 13 ... 
action that any of us may individually pref er1 o. 
In any case, I could also defend an action approving the NOA under labeling 
that either 1) wams about the residual ·uncertainties concerring the 
safety of the high dose regimen, or 2) omits the high dose/high rate 
regimen on the grounds that there is Insufficient evidence to erisure Its 
safety. 
Neither of these options is entirely appealing, however, because Cerebyx• 
Is only able to deliver phenytoin as rapidly as Dilantin• injection under 
the high dose, high rate regimen, and, therefore, we could not be certain, 
under either of these options, that Cerebyx would be fully effective (or as 
effective as Dtlantln® Injection), when used In the m1anageme!'lt of status. 
We could, of course, disapprove the NOA, arguing, aa we did when It waa 
first submitted, that more clinical experience (I.e., safe pa111g1) with the 
product under the high intravenous loading dose regimen le required before 
we can conclude that It Is sate In use regardless of the reatrlctlona 
placed on its use In labeling. The argument being made here is that 
whatever the labeUng Umltatlona or reetrloUona appHed, the product 
would, If marketed, be likely to be uaed under the high do1e/hlgh rate 
regimen, a reg~men yet to be shown to be safe. 
This would be a dlfflcult regulatory position to defend, however, because 
we are only obliged, at least ordinarily, to determine whether or not a 
drug is safe for use under the conditions of use recommended In Its 
labeling. In short, were It not for the status eplleptlcua Indication, It 
would be easy to conclude that Cerebyx~ has been shown to be aaf e for 
use. On the other hand, none of us Is unaware of the extent of 'off IBbel' 
use of marketed drug product• and the potential for that uae to cause 
harm. 
10 Personally, I would clearly feel more comfortable with an approvable 
action if it were taken with the knowledge that 200, rather than 66 patients, had been 
exposed without serious incident to the highest dose and rate intravenous loading 
regimen. The problem, of course, is that I would take still greater comfort if there 
were 2000 such exposures. Leber: Cerebyx• [phoegt)enytoin Injection] approvable action page 14 
Importantly, nothing In this dlscuaaton ts intended to gainsay or 
undermine the potential advantages that may well be provided by 
Cerebyx*. An Injectable form of phenytoin that is less locally irritating 
than Dllantin® (reasonably inferred from what we know but not proven) 
would be especially useful for intramuscular uso. The point la that It is a 
matter of personal judgment whether the gains are auff lclant to outweigh 
our residual doubts aboJt Its safety for use. 
Finally, neither t. nor any member of the review team, to my knowledge, 
Is so wedded to any single view of this matter that we are absolutely 
committed to one and only one course of action. To the contrary, thia ia a 
close decision and I can accept any of the 3 options enumerated. I am, as 
are members of the review team, available to disc m_,,. further, 
as required. ,----- /~ /

I believe t~ia application is approvabla and th•t the available 
data and documented exposure are suf ticient for a proding for a 
very familiar active moiety. The possibility remains, as you 
note, that •ome rare, "idio•yncratic" reeponee to the •hort-liver 
parent molecule, or to a minor unauepect•d metabolite of the 
parent, could occur, but a few ioo more patient~ will not resolve 
that question. 
I have modified the letter •lightly, I think •till reflecting 
what was sought by the Oiviaion. 
I have one regulatory, not scientific question: why ia 
f 0sphenytoin con•id•red an NME? Type 4 NDAa include new salt• or 
estor1 of a previoualy approved active moiety. Although 
allowance i• made for 1table eaters, especially where th••• are

-----------------------------------------------------------------The Division's review team has reviewed the comments about the Cerebyx 
action presented In your memo to me of 2120/96. 
We take your point that the Intravenous administration of Cerebyx under any 
dosing regimen cannot precisely reproduce the phenytoln Input to the 
systemic circulation that la obtained with the direct infusion of phenytoin 
sodium at 50 mg/min. Accordingly, we have revised the dosing Instructions 
so that the recommended regimen for the treatment of status ts between 100 
mg PE/min and 150 mg PE/min. This should reault In an intermediate choice 
by many and that wlll be f Ina. 
For the most part, we have otherwise made the changes In the labeling and 
letter as you requested, except for one or two places. 
Qosing iQd Admtnjatratton Sactign; 
Here, we found your additional commentt to be verbose and confusing. 
Accordingly, we simplified the Instructions, providing the major points 
regarding Iv use in a series of 4 brief bullets. 
We did, however, incorporate the intent of your comments in this section in 
the Clinical Pharmacology Section. 
Warning Saottoo; 
Tho instruction regarding the maximum rate of phoaphenytoln infusion seems Leber: NOA 20-450 note on memorandum of 2120198 page 2 ... 
unn.-cassarily confusing when it includes the phrase "at rates greater than 
50 mg/min.11 We would prefer deleting the phrase. The call, however. la 
clearly yours and toward that end we provide two pages 6's, one with and one 
without the phrase. 
Pharmacology: 
I have allowed Ed Fisher and Glenna to repair and revise the pharm aecttone 
as they believe bast. I find their changes reasonable and aaeume that you 
will as well. 
Questions In tba mamoraodum: 
First, foaphenytoin is an eater, but not of phenytoln. It'• an NME and we can 
take crtidlt accordingly. 
As to your other queatlone, I'm not sure that I can an1w1r them In a 
meaningful manner: I'll try (John Feeney ta my major source of Inspiration 
and data on this).

Third Safety Update 
April 12, 1996 
April 15, 1996 
Background: Thia safety update consists of 2 volumes out of a 4 volume 
submission. The entire aubmiaaion represents the aponaor'a response to a 
recent Approvable Letter. 
Expoaure: The cutoff date for the laat (aecond) safety update was 
September 15, 1995. This SU covers all deaths, serious AEs, and 
withdrawals for AEa that have occurred since then. Data are also provided 
from 2 studies of Fos which are being conducted under a 
separate IND . Events from all studies are summarized through 
March 8, 1998. 
It appears that there la t»nly one ongoing study In statue epileptlcue. Only 
5 additional pta have been enrolled since the last (second) SU. Of th••• 5, 
no deaths, serious AEs, or withdrawals because of aerloua AEa have been 
reported. Therefore, this SU reports almost entirely on the experience of 
Cerebyx In stroke. 
Deatha: 10 death• (on placebo or Foa) occurred out of 79 pta enrolled In 
stroke studies. We know that 1/1 O deaths occurred on Foa and 1/1 O 
deaths occurred on placebo. Becauae the blind has not been broken In the 
other stroke study, we do not know the treatment assignment of the 8 
other deaths. All death• appear related to the stroke Itself or the 
aequelae of 1troke. None of the deaths were attributed to Fos. 
Serloua, Nonf1t1I AE•: 5 pt1 had 1eriou1 AE1 that were nonfatal. Ona 
of these, severe hypotenaion related to Cerebyx was reported aa an IND 
safety report on March 12, 1998 and ia outlined In the next paragraph. The 
blind waa not broken for the other AEs, but a review of them suggests that 
none would be considered attributed to study drug. Pt 113 in Study 25, a .. 51-yr-old woman, developed an absolute decrease of 
67 in her systolic pressure during a loading dose of Cerebyx for treatment 
of stroke. BP was 142/86 and dropped to 75/50. The investigator 
classified the event as life-threatening, although the BP returned to 
baseline with fluids. 
Wlthdrawal1 Due to Al!a: 5 pts withdrew due to AEa. 3/5 occurred in a 
completed atroke study so that we know all 3 received Cerebyx. The other 
2 occurred in an ongoing stroke study where the blind has not been broken. 
Patients 111 In Study 19 in stroke had the infusion stopped (note· that the 
rate waa 50 mgPE/mln) because of pertneal burning and itching. The event 
was called severe and occurred after only 27% of the injection waa given. 
Symptoms resolved after13 minutes followed an hour later by recurrence 
of mild Itching for 5 min. 
Patients 118 in Study 19 in stroke had the infusion stopped (note that the 
rate waa 50 mgPE/mtn) because of pertneal itching. The event waa called 
moderate and occurred after 16°/o of the injection was given. Symptoms 
resolved In 5 minutes. 
Other events were mild.hypotenaion, severe bradycardia (treatment 
assignment unknown), and atrial fibrillation in a pt with a history of AFlb 
(treatment assignment unknown). 
Summary: 
Burning, 1tching, bradycardia, hypotenalon are all described in proposed 
labeling. Therefore, the safety profile of Car a not changttd with 
the addition of this safety update.

Background: The entire 4-volume submission represents the sponsor's 
response to a recent Approvable Letter. Two volumes represent the 
requested safety update and are reviewed in a separate document. The 
other two volumes represent the proposed labeling revisions along with 
supporting documentation. 
Proposed Labeling Changea: Only major changes are addressed here. 
Two pervasive changes made by the sponsor are the correct Insertion of 
the word sodium whenever describing equivalent doses of Cerebyx and 
parenteral Dllantin. Phenytoin as the free acid (Oilantin-30 Pediatric and 
Dilantin-125 Suspensiona and Oilan\in lnfatabs) would have a different 
dose equivalence. The sponsor would also like to delete the PE used 
throughout labeling to refer to doses of Cerebyx. The very fact that 
different phanytoin products already on the market provide different 
amounts of phenytoin for equivalent weight-baaed dosing regimens would 
support the use of the PE notation throughout labeling to point out the 
equivalence only to phenytoin sodium and not to the free acid. 
Issues related to formate and phosphate have been addressed by the 
sponsor by presenting data from Study 27, a PK study of the high-dose, 
high-rate loading dose. Some of this data was presented in submissions 
(specifically requested by me) dated May 2 and May IS, 1998. This 
information is discussed in Appendix I. ..

119 Overview 
Cerebyx (fosphenytoin) has been developed by Parke-Davis 
The basis for an approval action on this NOA is the demonstrated 
bioequivalence of IV Cerebyx and IV Dllantln. When Cerebyx was 
administered at an IV rate that was three times g1reater on a molar basis 
than the rate of Dilantln, bioequivalence based on free phenytoin levels 
was demonstrated. 
It became clear during the review of this NOA that confusion readily 
arises in discussing the dosage of Cerebyx. The molecular weight of 
Cerebyx is 50°/o greater than Dilantin, so that 150mg Cerebyx delivers the 
same molar amount of pheny1toln as 1 OOmg Dllantin. Therefore, an 
infusion rate of 75mg/min Cerebyx delivers the same molar amount of 
phenytoin as SOmg/mtn Dllantin (the maximal labeled rate for Dllantln). 
However, the bioequlvalent rates (as defined above for free phenytoin 
levels) would be 225mg/min Cerebyx and 50mg/min Dilantin. 
Since the use of Cerebyx will, by design, be temporary with conversion to 
oral phenytoin soon thereafter, I believe that Cerebyx dosing should be 
expressed in phenytoln equivalents in labeling. Thus, 150mg Cerebyx 
would be expressed as 1 OOmg phenytoin equivalents (PE). This eliminates 
the one and only step in converting total oral phenytoln dosing to 
parenteral Cerebyx dosing, but still leaves one step in converting the 
Dilantin loading dose rate (SOmg/min) to the bloequlvalent Cerebyx 
loading dose rate ( 150mg/min phanytoin equivalents). By not expressing 
Cerebyx as PE in labeling, I believe there will be considerable confusion in 
dosing during the first few years of general use. 
l Cerebyx is a phosphate ester of phenytoin. The bloavallabillty of 
phenytoin after IM Cerebyx is 1 OOo/a with good local tolerability in over 
300 patients exposed. The sponsor contends that IV Cerebyx is better 
tolerated at the injection site than IV Dllantin. This latter point is 
supported by the normal volunteer studies when injection site irritation 
is examined in Cerebyx and Dllantin treated patients at bloequlvalent 
rates. The active-control trials In patients did not adequately control for 
dose and rate betweeen Cerebyx and Dllantln patients, so that no 
additional comparative data on IV injection site Irritation Is yielded by 
those studies. Study 26 may provide comparative information along these 
lines, but we are not yet . in possession of that final study report. 
Cerebyx is rapidly converted to phenytoin with a half·llfe of 15 minutes. 
The two byproducts of this conversion are phosphate and formaldehyde. 
The theoretical safety concerns of formaldehyde formation have been 
addressed by the sponsor and are the subject of much diacus&lon in the 
pharm/tox review ot Dr. Fisher. On page 60 of his review, Or. Fisher notes 
(page 60 of his review) that peak plasma formaldehyde levela would be 
predicted to be 5.4mg/L, with levels returning to background levels 
(2.Smg/L) within 20 minutes. In fact, formaldehyde levels are apparently 
difficult to measure in plasma. and beyond this, the toxicity of 
formaldehyde may in large part be due to Its metabolism to formate as 
occurs in methanol poisoning. 
Formate levels that produce optic nerve pathology are only 10·20 X 
background levels. Maximal formate levels were predicted by the sponsor 
to be no higher than background levels. This prediction has not been 
verified with empiric data to date. Formate levels were not measured in 
preclinical toxicity studies; in fact, models of formate toxicity in non­
primates can only be produced In the presence of folate deficiency. 
Normal formate levels were measured in 4 normal volunteers, but at a 
Cerebyx-exposure much less than will occur with the standard loading 
dose. In the absence of formate levels In adequately loaded subjects, the 
safety margin cannot be stated. 
Not addressed by the sponsor or the pharm/tox review is the phosphate 
load with Cerebyx. The loading dose of Cerebyx delivers 75mg elemental 
phosphorus. Assuming retention in the plasma, the theoretical Increase in 
serum phosphorus would be 2mg/dL. If the calcium-phosphorus product 
2 exceeded 60· 70 in a given patient, the theoreticBI concern would be 
calcium deposition in soft tissues and a possible transient decrease in 
calcium. The sponsor has measured ionized free calcium at the end of a 7 
minute loading dose In 5 volunteers and found these levels to be normal. 
Obviously, this is a smaU experience which should probably be expanded. 
Additionally, the sponsor should be asked to assess the distribution of the 
phosphorus load in varying states of decreased glomerular filtration. 
Labeling should certainly make note of this issue, especially in dialysis 
patients. (The sponsor performed a study in dialysis patients, but used a 
small loading doae administered over 30 minutes.) 
The safety database accrued is complex and makes any exptrapolation of 
the results difficult. Several important points follow: 
First, the two active-control trials with IV Dilantin (Studies 15 and 21) 
do not allow any direct comparisons between treatments. Both trials 
incorporated IV loading doses (one of the two also included maintenance 
IV dosing beyond the IV load) and I believe the loading dose presents the 
biggest safety concern in the use of Cerebyx. However, neither trial 
provided for Cerebyx and Dilantin to be administered at the bioequivalent 
rates. (Study 26 may allow for some direct comparisons, but we do not 
have the final study report yet.) 
Second, as a general rule over the entire database, the high-dose, high­
rate Cerebyx patients were also some of the sickest patients, usually 
patients with status epileptlcus. While this may in fact mirror the 
intended usage of high-dose, high-rate Cerebyx, It makes the 
interpretation of the safety data more difficult. 
Third, the patients exposed to Cerebyx tendad to fall into one of two 
categories: 1) seriously ill patients with status epllepticus or pending 
neurosurgery and 2) relatively stable patients with epilepsy. The net 
effect of this is that the safety data from one group cannot really be 
merged with the other. 
Normal volunteer studies were in general limited to escalating IV 
11loading" doses. Since the population of normal volunteers is relatively 
homogeneous, I believe it provides important information on rate-related 
adverse events, making some ~omparisona between Cerebyx and Dllantin 
treated subjects possible. For instance. one unique adverse event that 
3 occurs with Cerebyx ia u sensation of generalized itching or tingling 
which is variously coded as prurftus or paresthesia. In the normal 
volunteer studies, this phiiJnomenon can be seen to be rate-related for both 
Cerebyx and Dilantin, but with a much higher incidence with Cerebyx at 
bioaquivalent rates of administration. 
Similarly, in the normal volunteer studies, Injection site pain and 
injection site reaction arn seen to be rate .. related for IV Ollantin and 
occur only rarely for Cerubyx at any rate. 
The sponsor has proposed uae of Cerebyx for up to 14 days. HoV1ever, only 
a few patients were expos·1d for longer than 5 days. I believe labeling 
should reflect the databast with use allowed for 5 days or leas. 
For labeling purposes, the r:ponsor proposes to present adverse event data 
separately for the 3 controlled trials. Since the AE profiles in these 
trials only reflect the population studied (seriously ill neurosurgery 
patients vs stable epilepsy patients) and PJlnce the standard deviation 
around any point estimate from a given trial must be exceedingly large, 
would argue to discard thee e tables from labeling and bring forward the 
descriptive list of AEs in the parenteral Dilantin labeling. 
Finally, the sponsor has not fully addressed the unique adverse event of 
pruritus/paresthesia seen with Cerebyx. In particular, the ISS often uses 
descriptive language to th~ ,3ffect that this AE was 11uaually transient." 
In my review, I could not ascertain the outcome of all cases of this AE. I 
found no specific mention of a case of pruritus/paresthesla that 
persisted, but I would request the sponsor to directly address the question 
of reversibility of this AE. The second safety update (November 1995) 
added 100 individual expoauras to the high-dose, high·ra~e experience 
with Cerebyx and confirmed the frequent occurrence of pruritus in that 
situation. The sponsor could provide more information on the experience 
of these individuals with the sensory disturbance. 
Conclualona: 
Cerebyx is approvable. The following additional information is needed 
before a final approval action can be taken: 
1. The sponsor should provide a more complete description of the sensory 
4 disturbance caused by Cerebyx, to include the reversibility over time. 
2. Levels of phosphorus, magnesium, and free calcium should be me1:&sured 
at frequent timepointa during a 7 minute loading doaa of Cerebyx and 
correlated with the character of the aan1ory disturbance. 
3. Formate levala should ba measured after a loading do1e of Cerabyx. 
Since the breakdown of formate la folate dependent, and because folate 
deficiency may be common in the population treated with Cerebyx 
(alcoholics and/or patients on chronic phenytotn therapy), some attempt 
should be made to measure formate levels In a folata deficient population 
after a loadiny dose of Cerebyx. 
The advantages of Cerebyx over parenteral Dllantln are: 
1 . Given IV, ft produces fewer local reactions, can be given In one· third 
the time of Dilantln, and may be more compatible with other IV aoluttons. 
2. It can be given IM with predictable absorption and fewer local 
reactions. Perlpheral Sen1ory Phenomena 
Background: We refused to file the original NOA 1ubmia1ion for Cerebyx 
because of the minimal safety database accrued at high dose, high rate (SE 
dosing) infusions. The sponsor only slightly improved upon this at the 
time of the resubmlaaton. Again, the first safety update only minimally 
improved upon this. The aecond safety update in late 1995 more than 
doubled the exposure to SE dosing. 
Looking only at the NOA aubmiaslon, It baoame clear from normal 
volunteer studies that a dose· and rate-related sensory disturbance 
occurred with IV Cerebyx. In patient studies, the bulk of patients exposttd 
to SE dosing were too obtundad to report sensory diaturbancea beo•uae 
they were in fact SE patients. Therefore, in patient atudie1, a does-and 
rate-related sensory disturbance waa leas obvious. 
The second safety update in late 1996 included the reaulta of Study 26 
performed from April 1995 to June 1995. Ninety patient& were added to 
the SE dosing database. Half the patients were epilepsy patients (not SE 
patients and not neurosurgery patients) and would not be expected to be 
obtunded. Likewise half the patients reported pruritus. Because we are 
not in possession of all the information from Study 26, wa cannot 
ascertain the exact proportion of patients who were aiert enough to report 
sensory disturbances. It is possible, given the information provided, to 
assume that all awake patients in Study 26 experienced some degree of 
sensory disturbance; it is alao possible that vnly half did. 
These were not trivial diaturbancaa. The Infusion was Interrupted or 
diacontinued for 13144 (30°/o) patients experiencing pruritus. The 
intensity was rated severe for 6/44 (14°/o) patients; moderate for 17144 
(39°/o) patients: and mild for the remainder. 
The mean onset time was 2 minutes for these 44 patients. By the time of 
follow-up, outcome was unknown for 1144 patients. Resolution of sensory 
symptoms is reported for all the reat. Because time·to-re1olution is 
referenced to end of infusion, and becauaa we are to'd that infu1ion1 were 
slowed or stopped because of pruritus in a third of patients, we cannot 
determine what happens In the absence of altered rate and time of 
6 Infusion. It sounds like most patients improve within 5-10 minutes of 
stopping the infusion (12-17 minutes from start of infusion, assuming the 
Infusion is given over the prescribed 7 minutes). A fourth of patients have 
some degree of disturbance beyond this point (median, 1 hour). 
The second safety update also mentioned the reaulta of Study 27, a 16-
subject PK and safety study. 75°1' of these normal volunteers experienced 
prurltus; 75'Yo of these normal volunteers experienced pareatheala. Four of 
the 16 subjects (25°/o) reported .. severe" pruritus. 
Significance: Just based on what we know about thll phenomenon, it is 
clear that the natural history of the disturbance· must be elucidated more 
clearly in order to provide for the safe use of this drug. For Instance, the 
Intensity of symptoms for those patients who experience symptoms 
beyond onf! hour of dosing has not been provided to us. Do some patients 
have severe prurltus for days or do only mild symptoms persist beyond one 
hour ? Since many patients who receive IV loading with Cerebyx will not 
need rapid loading, labeling will need to reflect a rate for those patients 
which results in minimal discomfort. 
Also, could the pathophysiology that underlies the sensory disturbances 
with SE dosing of Cerabyx herald some more sarlous pathology ? 
In awake patients treated with SE dosing of Cerebyx, patient reporting of 
sensory disturbance could lead to lowering of rate. In obtunded patients, 
this margin of safety has been removed. 
Example of Fo•c•vlr (foecsrnet): Foscavir is an example of a drug 
where the onset of sensory disturbance does nernld more serious 
problems, specifically with hypocalcemla. Foscavlr was developed for IV 
administration for the treatment of CMV retinitis in the mid·19BOs. Early 
on it became clear that many patients experienced distal and perll')ral 
pareatheaiaa, tetany, and seizures. The constellation of symptoms and 
signs was identical to that seen with hypocalcemla and, In fact, total 
serum calcium levels were low in some patients. Cases of fatal 
hypocalcttmia have been reported with this drug. 
Experience with Foacavlr has demonstrated that the labeled loading 
infusion may cause decreases in ionized free calcium even though total 
7 serum calcium remains norma1.1,2 The mechanism of this ionized 
hypocalcemia is believed to be chelation of free calcium by foscarnet 
itself (structurally appearing as a phos~1hate moiety with a carboxyl group 
substituted for an oxygen). Foscarnet ie excreted unchanged in the urine, 
presumably carrying calcium with it. inere is no evidence that foscarnet 
is broken down to phosphate, and there is no evidence of phosphate 
precipitating out of solution with calcium. While foscarnet itself Is toxic 
to renal tubule cells, there is no evidence of nephroc&lcinosis (deposition 
of calcium-phosphate precipitates in the kidney) or other soft tissue 
calcium deposition. 
The current labeling for Foscavir states (WARNINGS; Mineral and 
Electrolyte Imbalance), "Therefore, patients should be advised to report 
symptoms of low ionized calcium such as perioral tingling, numbness in 
the extremities and paresthesias. Physicians should be prepared to treat 
these as well as severe manifestations of electrolyte abnormalities such 
as tetany and seizures. The rate of Foscavir infusion may affect the 
transient decrease in ionized calcium. Slowing the rate may decrease or 
prevent symptoms." 
Possible Meehan/ams of Cerebyx-lnduced Sensory Disturbance: 
There are many ways that Cerebyx could cause sensory symptoms. Any 
explanation ha• to account for a lack of aymptoma at 
bloequivalent dosing regimen• of parenteral Dllantln. Perhaps IV 
fosphenytoin (the parent compound) alone causes sensory disturbance. Or 
perhaps lV fosphenytoin results in a distribution of phenytoin in tissues 
that is different from the distribution that results from parenteral 
Dilantin. Formate and phosphate are the two byproducts of fosphenytoln 
metabolism. Either one of these could cause transient sensory 
disturbances either directly or via an intermediate step. 
A. Formate: Note that several steps are necessary in the metabolism of 
Cerebyx before the formation of formate. Given lhe almost immediate

8 onset of the sensory phenomenon, it seems unlikely that formate would be 
the causative agent. 
8. Phosphate: When I investigated the degree of phosphate loading with 
Cerebyx, I was impressed. Approximately 1 gram of phosphorus is 
ingested each day in an average United States diet. Of this, 700mg is 
absorbed. In comparison, an IV loading dose of Cerebyx includes 75mg of 
phosphorus; the SE dosing regimen would introduce the fosphenytoin over 
7 minutes. One outdated regimen for treating hypercalcemia3 was to give 
phosphates IV at a dose of 20 to 30 mg of elemental phosphorus per kg 
over 1 ~ to 16 hours. In a 70kg person, this would result In 1 OOmg/hr. A 
stated hazard of this therapy was extraskeletal calcifications, including 
nephrocalcinosis with resulting renal failure. 
C. Sponsor's Comments on Mechanisms: The sponsor first addresses 
underlying mechanisms of these sensory disturbances from Cerebyx on the 
third-to-the-last page of the second safety update. "Although the 
underlying mechanism of fosphenytoin-induced pruritus and paresthesia is 
unknown, similar symptoms have also been reported for other phosphate­
ester prodrugs and for foscarnet." The "other phosphate-ester prodrugs" 
referenced by the sponsor are Decadron and Hydrocortone. 
Curiously, the character and location of the sensory disturbance described 
for Decadron and Hydrocortone matches the dominant description in 
Cerebyx-treated subjects. With all 3 agents, patients describe a burning 
or itching which localizes primarily to the groin area. 
By my calculation, IV loading dosr:s of Decadron and Hydrocortone provide 
1 /20th-1/10th the elemental pho~phorus provided by a loading dose of 
Cerebyx. Therefore, assuming phosphate is the common link, it would not 
be surprising that Cerebyx would produce more severe burning and itching. 
Calcium Metabollam: Calcium is usually measured in the clinic as total 
serum calcium (normal 9·10.4mg/dl). About 50°/o of serum calcium is 
ionized and 100/o is complexed with citrate, phosphate, bicarbonate, and 
lactate. The rest (40°/o) is protein-bound, mninly to albumin. The 
concentration of serum calcium is reflected in the proportion: [Ca] x 
3Aenal and Electrolyte Disorders Schrier (editor). Little, Brown and 
Company, 1976; p 198. 
9 [Phosphate]/[Calcium-Phosphate]. The normal range for phosphorus is 3-
4.Smg/dl. The product of [Ca) (mg/dl) x [Ph] (mg/dl) therefore normally 
approaches 50. When the product approaches 60· 70, most textbooks raise 
concern about precipitation with resultant soft tissue calcification, to 
include nephrocalcinosis. 
By weight, phosphorus represents 15/406 or 3-40/o of fosphenytoin so that 
a loading dose of Cerebyx delivers 75mg phosphorus. If this load 
remained in the vascular space, the serum phosphorus could theoretically 
rise by 2mg/dl, thereby raising the calcium-phosphorus product to 70. 
This would drive the equilibrium toward calciumftphosphate and tend to 
lower calcium. As with Foscavir, the Ionized free calcium would probably 
reflect this drop better than total serum calcium values. 
Note, however, that hypocalcemia typically causes a tingling sensation 
around the face and in the hands, not a burning ir· the groin as we have 
seen in many Cerebyx patients. 
Although the sponsor has not acknowledged this theoretical concern, it 
must have crossed their minds. The second safety update briefly 
summarizes an open-label safety and PK study performed in June 1995 
which incorporated 16 healthy subjects, each given a single SE dose of 
Cerebyx (Study 27). In reviewing individual lab listings for these 
subjects, I notice that 9/16 subjects had ionized free calcium levels 
performed at 18 minutes, while 5 of the same subjects had ionized free 
calcium levels performed at 8 minutes. None of the levels are remarkable, 
either when viewed as absolute values or as change from baseline. 
Certainly these measurements are not comparable to those reported for 
Foscavir. However, note that the SE dose of Cerebyx is delivered over 7 
minutes. With only 5 ionized free calcium level checked at 8 minutes and 
the rest performed at 18 minutes, I do not believe we can rule out the 
occurrence of a transient hypocalcemia during the 7 minute infusion. 
Further, the clinical status of these 5 (or 9) subjects is not stated. Were 
they subjects with or without pruritus ? 
In the absence of more data on ionizeri free calcium, I reviewed total 
calcium levels in Study 26. Note that, aside from the 8 and 18 minute 
clinical labs in Study 27, I am not aware of clinical labs in any other 
studies being performed early enough to be informative on this subject. 
Still, 25°/o of Cerebyx-treated patients in Study 26 are listed with low 
10 calcium levels. Since this does not differ from the Dilantin-treated 
group. I would doubt It is important. 
A review of all deaths and serious AEs in Study 26 raises no particular 
concerns regardir.g other manifestations of hypocalcemia. In particular, 
do not see any description of seizures occurring in proximity 'to Cerebyx 
infusions, cardiac rhythm disturbance, or tetany. In fact, the profile of 
serious AEs appears roughly the same for Cerebyx and Dilantin treated 
patients in Study 26. Again, though, patients In Study 26 "had near 
normal level• of conaclouaneaa to report adverse events and 
Infusion tolerance" (2nd safety update,p35) which may . not 
mirror the SE population moat likely to receive the SE doses of 
Cerebyx. Patients In Study 26 could report sensory symptoms 
early and thereby cause their rate to be lowered. 
Summary: 
1. The natural history of the sensory disturbance caused by Cerebyx at SE 
dosing has not been fully characterized. In particular, we do not know if 
the intensity (severe for many) correlated with duration (many hours for 
some), especially in the absence of dose and rate reductions. 
Relevant to this last point is that the number of known obtunded patients 
given SE dosing regimens remains small. (We don't know the level of 
consciousness for all Study 26 patients.) For these patients, the longterm 
follow-up was short, 3-5 days by protocol. More obtunded patients, given 
SE dosing without rate reductions and followed tor longer periods of time, 
would add a margin of safety to the Cerebyx experience. (Perhaps Study 
2'; contains some of this information.) Pertinent to this, the patients in 
Study 16 who were given the SE dosing regimen could have their status at 
the 3-5 day visit teased out and presented separately. Patient 2 at Center 
8 has pruritus beginning on day 2, continuing, and not yet recovered, but 
the duration of follow-up is not clearly stated. The "mild itching feeling" 
reported for Patient 22, Center 9 in Study 16 on Day 4, just after 
experiencing post-ictal psychosis is intriguing along these lines. 
2. One very plausible thEory for the sensory disturbance (one which the 
sponsor has begun to investigate in Study 27) is a drug-induced transient 
drop in ionized free calcium. I believe this needs to be investigated more 
11 comprehensively, prior to drug approval. This could be accomplished by 
checking free calcium levels more frequently, at earlier time points, and 
in more patients. There may be value in also check.ing magnesium levels 
at the same time, since magnesium is another example of a divalent 
cation. Sensory symptoms could be correlated with calcium and 
magnesium levels. (Indeed, presenting free calcium levels for 9/16 
subjects in Study 27 raises the concern that values are not presented for 
the subjects with sensory disturbances.) 
Relevant to the this, the sponsor could measure serum phosphate levels in 
closer proximity to the infusion since phosphate levels would predict 
potential for hypocalcemia. 
• 
12 Formate 
For each mmole of Cerebyx administered, one mmole of formate is 
produced. Therefore, a loading dose of Cerebyx delivers about 5 mmoles of 
formate to the individual. Assuming all the formate stayed within the 
circulation (5 liters), a maximal theoretical increase of 1 MMOLJL in 
background formate levels could occur. This was recognized at the time 
the IND for fosphenytoin was ffrst filed in 1986 (see the pharm/tox 
review of Dr. Fitzgerald from 1986). 
In 1986, the sponsor --at that time) measured formate levels in 4 
subjects administered a small loading dose of fosphenytoin over 30 
minutes (half as much fos as constitutes a current loading dose, given 
over a greater time interval). Background levels were 0.5 MMOUL and did 
not increase. Since then, formate levels have not been measured in any 
human studies of Cerebyx. 
Given the measured background levels in that study and the maximal 
theoretical increase, the maximal theoretical level that could be achieved 
after a Cerebyx loading dose is 1.5 MMOUL. 
In monkey studies referenced by Dr. Fisher in the current pharm/tox 
review, formate levels as low as 7 MMOL/L could cause the characteristic 
optic nerve lesions of formate toxicity (implied, but not clearly stated, is 
that levels below 7 MMOUL did not cause the lesion in the monkey 
studies). 
There are ongoing investigations into the mechanism of methanol toxicity, 
due in part to interest in methanol as an automotive fuel. Methanol is 
converted to formaldehyde and then to formate. Investigators have found 
that rats, normally resistant to methanol toxicity, can be made sensitive 
13 to methanol toxicity by creating a state of folate deficiency.1,2 This 
folate-reduced (FA) rat model has been the subject of some recent studies 
on methanol toxicity. In this model, 2.5-3.0 MMOUL formate probably 
represents the NOEL (personal communication from Robert Louis-Ferdinand 
to Dr. Ed Fisher). Formate levels of 7-10 MMOUL are associated with 
changes in the electroretinogram of the FR rat and with the histological 
abnormalities in the optic nerve. 
In the NOA, preclinical studies were performed in non-primates which are 
not susceptible to formate toxicity unless they are made folate deficient. 
Formate levels were not measured in these studies. 
The human clinical literature on methanol toxicity includes reported 
formate levels in patients who died, suffered visual loss, and who 
survived without deficits.3,4 Formate levels as low as 2·4 MMOUL are 
raported in some fatalities. Unfortunately, the timing of these levels in 
relation to the methanol exposure are not always clear. Some reported 
formate levels may be peak levels white others are trough levelP. Levels 
of 1 O MMOL/L and above do seem to consistently be associated with poor 
outcomes. Levels below 1 O have outcomes that vary from complete 
recovery to death. Based on the information from monkey and FR rat 
studies. I believe the human levels below 10 in association with poor

14 outcomes may simply represent trough levels in patients who experience 
much higher levels at other times in their clinical course. 
Folate-deficient populations are a topic of some discussion in the 
literature on methanol toxicity. Alcoholism, pregnancy, and chronic 
phenytoin therapy are all states known to be ass'lciated with folate 
deficiency. Treatments that alter folate metabolism, such as dietary 
manipulation, nitrous oxide, and methotrexate, have been shown to modify 
methanol toxicity in monkeys and rats. Methanol-derived levels of 
formate are higher in folate-deficient monkeys than in normal monkeys 
after similar exposures to methanol.5 These authors found that elevations 
in formate levels after very high inhalation exposures, whether in normal 
or folate-deficient monkeys, were only a fraction of background formate 
levels. 
Acidosis: Severe methanol toxicity is associated with a severe acidosis, 
as well as high formate levels. To quote one paper on methanol poisoning, 
11Formate accumulation occurs in a manner reciprocal to the depletion of 
bicarbonate.''4 When searching the line listings for Study 27 in the recent 
safety update, I found fairly complete data on bicarbonate levels from the 
16 subjects given loading doses. These levels were collected at regular 
30 minute intervals. For the 16 subjects entered, many of them showed 
some small decrement in bicarb with the nadir occurring at different 
times for different subjects. The biggest decrement occurred for subject 
16, with a baseline bicarb of 25.4 and an end-of-infusion reading of 18.6. 
(19-26MMOUL is given as the normal range.) It is unclear if these small 
decrements represent normal variability over time or some consistent 
effect of the infusions. 
I wonder if the decrements seen in bicarbonate in Study 27 might be used 
as markers for elevations in formate levels. Again, the sponsor has not 
specifically called attention to the existence of the bicarbonate data or to 
its significance. (It is not clearly stated why the bicarb levels were 
check'3d in the first place.)

15 Labeling for Cerebyx will have to reflect the fact that patients with 
status epilepticus usually have an underlying metabolic acidosis, the 
degree of which varies with the severity of the status and the cause of 
the status (see Patient 11, Study 16; multiple drug overdose), and that 
Cerebyx may add to this derangement. 
Anion Gap: If there is a transient decrease in bicarbonate in the absense 
of a change in sodium and chloride. we have defined an increase in the 
anion gap. Formation of formate and/or phosphate loading could increase 
the anion gap. For subject 16 in Study 27. the anion gap at the end of the 
infusion was 16 with a normal of 8-16. 
Sensory Symptoms: In the animal toxicology studies, Dr. Fisher has not 
seen any evidence of severe sensory symptoms such as writhing. If the 
animals experience the same phosphate load as humans (or slightly 
greater), and if phosphate is the origin of sensory symptoms, some painfu! 
behavior would have been expected. Since we know that formate 
metabolism is one area where these non-primates differ from humans in 
Cerebyx-processing, the question arises whether formate accumulation in 
humans could be contributing to the sensory disturbance. 
Summary: 
1. Formate levels have not been measured in humans after a loading dose 
of Cerebyx. 
2. Formate levels have not been measured in folate-deficient humans 
after a loading dose of Cerebyx. Introduction

First safety update 
Second safety update 
The basis for the refuse to file action in SepteJTlber 1994 was the small 
number of patients and volunteers treated with· Fos at a rate of 150 
mg/min PE. Only 4 pts with status epilepticus had been treated at that 
rate while about 20 normal volunteers had been treated at that rate. 
The sponsor continued to enroll pts in an ongoing status epilepticus study 
after the NOA was filed. On the basis of the increased numbers of pts 
treated as well as a recalculation of infusion rates for some previously· 
treated pts, it was agreed that the sponsor would resubmit the NOA in 
1995. 
B. Material Utlllzed In Review 
The NOA dated July 14. 1994 and received July 15, 1994 included 93 
volumes. Volumes 1.1, 1.47-1. 72, and 1.89·1.92 from that submission 
were used for purposes of this review. 
17 After the refusal to file, a resubmission dated February 22, 1995 and 
received February 23, 1995 was submitted. The resubmission included 15 
volumes. Volumes 3.1 and 3.9-3.12 from the resubmission were 
frequently used for purposes of this review. Those volumes included a 
rewritten Integrated Summary of Safety and rewritten study reports for 
Studies 982-15, 982-21, and 982-16. 
The 4-month safety update dated June 22, 1995 and received June 23, 
1995 was also used for this review. At my request, Tables 5 and 6 from 
the safety update were changed by the sponsor and submitted September 
14, 1995. 
The FDA Biopharm Review is also integral to the review of this NOA. 
C. Background 
Fosphenytoln Sodium (Fos) is the disodium phosphate ester of 3· 
hydroxymothyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin. It is a prodrug of phenytoin. It is 
rapidly and completely converted to phenytoin in vivo by ubiquitous 
phosphatases. Because of the phosphate ester, 150 mg Foa yields 100 mg 
phenytoin sodium. In this report, doses of Fos and dose rates of Fos will 
always be expressed as phenytoln equivalents (PE) as opposed to actual mg 
Fos. 
According to the sponsor, the presumed advantages of Fos over parenteral 
phenytoin are: 
• 
•

• 
* 
• pH 8.8 as opposed to pH 12 of Oilantln

shorter adminiatration times; can be given at 150 mg/min while 
Dilantin is limited to 50 mg/min 
minimal tissue traums at injection site (presumably due to lower 
pH 
no cardiovascular toxicity including hypotension 
While shorter administration times could be a distinct advantage in 
emergent situations, it will be seen below that this is actually a 
necessity in order to meet bioequivalence standards baaed on free 
phenytoir. levels after IV administration. 
18 The relative local injection site toxicities and cardiovascular toxicities 
of Fos and parenteral Dllantin remain a topic for this review. 
In fact, this NOA ia unique in many ways. First, there are no controlled 
trials to support the efficacy of Fos. The •controlled trials" submitted 
were really not designed to show a difference between treatment groups 
on a protocol-specified efficacy outcome. The majority of patients 
studied were not having seizures, but were only at risk tor seizures for 
one reason or another. 
Secondly, the bioequivalence data submitted in support of this application 
really only applies to the isolated instance of IV loading. To my 
knowledge, no bioequivalence data for IV maintenance dosing, IM loading, 
or IM maintenence dosing has been submitted. 
Thirdly, the limited safety database submitted in support of this 
application can be partitioned in two ways. The first way partitions the 
data by route of administration, IV versus IM. (In addition to the systemic 
toxicities that could be part and parcel of the route-determined 
bioavailability, there exists the route-specific local toxicities.) The 
second way partitions the data by loading versus maintenance ciosing. 
While the safety of a loading dose also speaks to the safety of a 
maintenance dose by the same route of administration, the converse is not 
true. Because of this last point, I have divided the patient safety database 
as seen in the table below. Subjects in normal volunteer studies are not 
included in this table. Since almost all normal volunteer studies (n•148 
Fas-exposed subjects) were single loading dose studies, these studies 
would be expected to add information primarily to the IV loading group.

Maintenance 
IV Route 181 88 181 
IM Route 178 297 357 
Note that the definition of "Loading" for purposes of such a tabla can be 
complicated. We could look only at the 11bioequivalent" IV loading dose, 
19 with a vary precise rate and total dose. Or we could include anyone with a 
total dose of 20mg/kg PE given over an hour or leas (a aubacute loading 
dose). Or we could include anyone with the "btoequlvalent" rate even if 
the total dose was as low as 10mg/kg PE. Interestingly enough, for the IM 
route, a bioequivalent loading dose cannot be defined because parenteral 
Dilantin is rarely given IM. The systemic bioavallabllity of IM Fas is 
reported to be 1 OOo/o 
D. Proposed Direction• for Uae 
The proposed labeling seeks an indication of Foe for short-term parenteral 
use for up to 14 days: 
o for status epilepticus 
o for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures in patients with 
epilepsy or in neurosurglcal patients 
o as a substitute for oral phenytoin when oral administration is 
not feasible 
The Dosage and Administration Section of the proposed labeling describes 
4 situations for use: 
1. IV loading in status epileptlcus 
2. IM or IV loading for treatment or prophylaxis 
3. IM or IV use for maintenance therapy 
4. IM or IV use for temporary substitution for oral Dilantln 
For status epilapticus, "the standard loading dose is 22.5 to 30 mg/kg 
(15-20 PE) infused at 150 to 225 mg/min (100·150 PE) in adults ... with 
vital signs ... and cardiac rhythm (ECG) monitored during and immediately 
after the infusion ... Cerebyx (19.5-25.5 mg,~· or 13·17 PE) administered 
at 225 mg/min (150 PE) is bloequivalent to an equimolar dose of Dilantin 
administered parenterally at 50 mg/min." 
Further, "Guidelines for the treatment of status epilepticus suggest that 
patients still in status epileptlcua after a phanytoin loading dose of 20 
mg/kg may i·eceive additional loading doses of 5 mg/kg up to a maximal 
dose of 30 mg/kg. Baaed on the1e guldellne1, patients treated with 
Cerebyx still in status epilepticus after a Cerebyx loading doae of 30 
mg/kg (20mg PE) may receive additional Cerebyx loading doses of 7.5 
mg/kg (Smg PE) up to a maximal Cerebyx dose of 45 mg/kg (30mg PE)." 
20 The sponsor has studied the loading doses above and, l'Jaaed on free 
phenytoln concentratlona, has found that Cerebyx infusions at 225 
mg/min (150mg PE) are bioequlvalent to standard Dilantin loading doses. 
However, if the standard of care for refractory status includes 
additional boluses, the sponsor has not studied the PK of Cerebyx at these 
higher doses.

IM Foa Maintenance 
The bioavailability of phenytoln, given as IM Fos, is 1000/o. In contrast, the 
bioavailability of phenytoln, given as Dilantin Kapseals is 90%. 
Bloequlvalence Studies for Emergent IV Load . .ig 
Study 18 was a 4-way crossover study of different doses and infusion 
rates. The concentration-time curves depicted in the publication of this 
study depict nearly superimposable curves for 1200 mg given at 100 
mg/min and 150 mg/min. While not designed as a bloequivalence study, it 
appears that these 2 infusion rates would be bioequivalent and, 
additionally, both result in similar rise times for free phenytoin 
concentrations. 
Data from a second published PK study shows Fos at 100 mg/min to have a 
slower rise time of free phenytoin concentration than Fos at 150 mg/min; 
the Cmax and AUCs appear similar otherwise. This study was designed as 
a bioequivalence study: Only Fos at 150 mg/min was bioequivalent to 
Dilantin at 50 mg/min. The rise time of free phenytoin levels was steeper 
for Fos, resulting in maximal levels about 5-7 minutes faster for Fos than 
Dllantin. 
Safety Concern• for Emergent IV Loading In Light of PK Data 
As described in later sections, there is minimal safety data for IV Fos 
given at a rate of 150 mg/min PE. The safety experience widens 
considerably if 100 mg/min is used as a cutoff. 
22 The 2 PK studies present discrepant data. In one, 100 vs 150 appear 
equivalent with similar rise times for free phenytoin levels. In the other, 
only 150 is bioequivalent to Dilantin 50 mg/min. 
The rise time for free phenytoin levels is significantly faster in one PK 
study compared to Dilantin. In the other study, the rise time is less steep 
and is similar for both 100 and 150 mg/min infusion rates. If the rise 
time is steeper with Fos 150 mg/min than for Dilantin at 50 mg/min, the 
potential exists for increased cardiovascular toxicity with Fos than with 
Dilantin. The only way to resolve the safety Issue would be to 
conduct a large enough safety study powered to detect ·a 
difference between parenteral Oilantln and Foa, given at 
50mg/mln and 150mg/mln respectively. A study with pts 
randomized to these 2 infusion rates has been designed by the sponsor to 
begin in April 1995, but it is unlikely that this study will have the power 
to detect a difference between the two drugs with respect to this AE. 
23 Safety 
Preclinical Safety Profile (see Dr. Fisher's review) 
The toxicological profile of Fos was essentially the same as that of 
phenytoin. Acute IV toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, 
rabbits, and dogs. Multidose toxicity studies were conducted by both the 
IV and IM routes in rats and dogs. The IV studies were 4 weeks in duration 
while the IM studies were 13 weeks in duration. 
Special studies of local tissue irritation were conducted. Fos produced 
significantly less venous and perivascular irritation than phenytoin at 
equimolar concentrations. Local irritation after IM injection of Fos to 
rabbits was significantly lower than after IM phenytoin. 
The cardiovascular effects of equimolar doses of phenytoin and Fos were 
comparable following IV bolus injection to anesthetized female dogs. Any 
less pronounced effects seen after Fos administration are presumed to be 
due to the lower peak blood levels of phenytoin resulting from its 
administration (22 vs 49 mcg/ml). 
The formation of formaldehyde after Fos administration raises a 
theoretical safety concern. The theoretical maximum dose of 
formaldehyde (assuming complete, instantaneous conversion) after an IV 
dose of 2100 mg Fos (proposed maximum human dose) based on a 1 :1 molar 
ratio would be 5.17 mmol or about 0.1 mmol/kg (3 mg/kg) for a 50 kg 
person. Using modeling techniques, peak formaldehyde levels were 
predicted to be approximately 0.18 mmol/L, with concentrations declining 
to background levels (0.027-0.068 mmol/L) within 20 minutes. Plasma 
formate levels measured in 4 healthy volunteers following administration 
of 1200 mg of Fos by IV infusion over 30 min were not significantly 
different from those observed in a placebo group or from baseline levels 
24 (25 mg/L). 
Dr. Fisher has reviewed the genetic toxicity and reproductive toxicity 
studies. Developmental toxicity seen in rats given Fos is consistent with 
that previously reported with phenytoin. 
Fos was clastogenic in Chinese hamster lung cells. Phenytoin was 
reportedly not clastogenic in previous studies with CHO cell:;.. One 
explanation for this discrepancy is that the clastogenicity of Fos is due to 
formaldehyde formation. 
1.0 Exposure 
849 volunteers and patients have participated in all Fos studies included 
in the NOA. These volunteers and patients account for 942 exposures to 
some study drug (Fos, phenytoin, or placebo) if patients in crossover 
studies are counted as 2 separate exposures. 
736 volunteers or patients have been exposed to Fos, including 148 
volunteers and 588 patients. 534 patients were part of the completed 
clinical studies while an additional 54 patients were part of ongoing 
Study 1 A (status epilepticus). 
The sponsor's list of all studies is attached. 
Note that almost all 148 volunteers in the early dose-escalation and PK 
studies received single IV doses of Fos. 
Two of the studies in patients were unusual in their dosing regimens. In 
study 005, patients received half of their maintenance oral dose of 
phenytoin as IV Fos and the other half as IM Fos. Study 1 O was an isotope 
study.

With the exception of 6 patients in Study 16 (status epilepticus), all 
patient~ were 16 years of age or older. Study 16 included 6 patients 
between tho ages of 5 and 10 years.

Duration of exposure by route of administration (••• aponaor'e 
Figure 4): 
Approximately 200 patients received IM Fos for 5 days, but only about 20 
patients received IM Fos for 6 days or greater. IM exposure to Fos was 
heavHy influenced by Study 13 which was designed as a 5-day study. 
Approximately 60 patients received IV Fos for 4 days, but only about 18 
patients received IV Fos for 5 days or greater. IV exposure to Fos was 
dependent on Study 15 where there was a proto~ol-apeclfiad option to 
switch to PO Dilantin after 3 days at the investigators' discretion. 
Doae and Rate (see 1ponsor'1 Figure 7 which Incorporates both 
volunteers and patients): 
The total dose given obviously depended on whether the dose was designed 
as a loading dose or a maintenance dose. 
The rate of administration for IV dosing was generally about 50 mg/min ± 
20 except where specifically pushed higher to the bioequivalent rates 
necessary in status (150 mg/min). 
2.0 Volunteer Studies 
148 unique volunteers were exposed to Fos. Some of these individuals 
may have received more than one exposure to Fos. As mentioned above, 
most of these volunteers received single IV doses as part of dose· 
escalation or PK studies. Sponsor's Table 3 represents the number of 
unique volunteer·~ exposed to Fos, Dilantin, and placebo in these studies. 
2.1 Deaths 
There were no deaths in volunteer studies. 
2.2 Serioua AEa and Dlacontlnuatlona

1 was on OBantin.. The patient narratives for all 3 patients are included 
below. The first Fos volunteer experienced progressiv& bradycardia 
leading to asystole for 23 seconds. During the asystole, the volunteer 
experienced 15 seconds of tonic-clonk~ movement. Because of subsequent 
abnormal electrophysiologic testing, the case was deemed unrelated to 
study drug. The subject had received SOOmg of a planned 750mg bolus at 
1 SOmg/min. 
The second Fos patient had hypotension and syncope after receiving 650mg 
of a planned 750mg bolus at 50mg/min. Bradycardia accompanied the 
event. 
The Dilantin subject experienc(;.u .1ypotension after receiving 600mg of 
Dilantin at SOmg/min. 
All 3 e·:c!"ts seem most consistent with vasovagal reactions. 
The classification of "discontinuations" or "withdrawals" would be 
somewhat uninformative for these volunteer studies since most of the 
studies were single dose IV "Jdies. Nevertheless, there were 3 
discontinuations. The 2 p1 1v mentioned Fas serious AEs account for 
2 of the 3 discontinuations. third discontinuation was a Dilantin 
treated subject who developed a wandering cardiac pacemaker during 
infusion. 
2.3 Severe AEs 
Severe AEs were reported in 5 Fos subjects and 3 Dilantin subject&. 1 /5 
severe Fos reactions was described as a serious AE; the other 4 severe 
AEs were: ataxia, stupor, tinnitus, and pruritus. The 3 severe Dilantln 
AEs were: injection site pain in 2 subjects and hypotension in 1 subject. 
2.4 All AEs 
The sponsor has chosen to present the AE data relative to the number of 
exposures vs the number of subjects. For this reason, the denominators 
differ from Table 3 above in that there were 211 Fos exposures in 148 
subjects. The number of exposures = number of subjects for placebo and 
Dilantin subjects. Sponsor's Table 6 shows all AEs, as well as those 
characterized as associated with test drug.

The most common AEs for Fos were: 
Dizziness 38% 
Paresthesia 32% 
Nystagmus 25°/o 
Tinnitus 14°/o 
Pruritus 14°/o 
Headache 12°/o 
Ear disorder 10o/o 
Except for paresthesia and pruritus, the incidence for all the above AEs 
was equal to or less than that for Dilantin. 
Injection site pain was 2% for Fos vs 30% for Dilantin. Injection site 
reaction was 2°/o for Fos vs 13°/o for Dilantin. 
2.5 Rate-related AEs After IV Administration 
Some AEs were rate·related after IV administration in both Fe...> and 
Dilantin treated subjects. More informative. however, are the 
discrepancies between Fos and Dilantin treated subjects, situations where 
an AE was clearly rate·related for one treatment but not the other. 
Taste perversion was rate·related for Fos, reaching 19o/o of Fos subjects 
when Fos was administered at 100-150 mg/min, but did not occur at any 
rate for Dilantin administration. 
Likewise. pruritus was rate-related for Fos, reaching 38°/o of Fos subjects 
when Fos was administered at 1Q0,·150 mg/min, but only occurred in a 
single Dilantin·treated subject. 
Paresthesia were rate-related for Dilantin as follows: 
0/12 cases at 15 mg/min or less 
0/14 cases at 15·30 mg/min 
11/30 (37%) cases at 30·50 mg/min 
Paresthesia were also rate-related for Fos as follows: 
3/54 (6°/o) at 15 mg/min or less 
3/ 17 ( 18°/o) at 15-30 mg/min 
18/62 (29°/o) at 30-50 mg/min 
43 ... 
23/35 (66°/o) at 50-100 mg/min 
21/31 (68°/o) at 100·150 mg/min 
Note that at bioequivalent rates, 37o/o Dilantin subjects vs 68% Fos 
subjects reported paresthesia. Of course, the total dose was not 
controlled for in these comparisons. 
2.6 Dose-related AEa After IV Administration 
No new trends over those reported in the rate-related AE section are 
obvious here. Taste perversion and pruritus increase with dose (as 
opposed to rate) in the absence of any significant number of events in 
Dilantin subjects at any dose. 
2.7 Clinical Labs 
The sponsor reports no clinically significant changes after Fos 
administration. Recall that most exposures in volunteers were single 
dose exposures. 
2.8 Injection Site Reactions 
Sponsor's Table 10 summarizes injection site reactions for the volunteer 
studies. Based on 102 Fos exposures and 39 placebo exposures, the profile 
of reactions for Fos and placebo are not significantly different. 97°/o of 
exposures in both groups resulted in none-mild reactions. For the 
Dilantin-exposures (n=32), 15°/u resulted in moderate reactions and 6°/., 
resulted in severe reactions. 
When rate-relatedness was examined, up to 23o/o of high-rate Oilantin 
exposures resulted in reactions. Reactions were not rate-related with 
Fos. Up to 43°/o of high-rate Dilantin exposures resulted in injection site 
pain. Pain was not rate-related with Fos. 
2.9 Vital Signs 
The ISS does not address vital signs in volunteer studies.

2.10 Conclualone From Normal Volunteer Studlea 
The great majority of data collected in normal volunteers is applicable to 
the IV bolus situation (at varying rates). In the categories severe AEs, all 
AEs, rate·related AEs. and dose-related AEsJ there is a consistent trade. 
off between the occurrence of local injection site reactlona and pain with 
IV Dilantin and the occurrence of generalized paresthesia and pruritus 
with IV Fos. 
Paresthesia are reported with IV Dilantin, but only at high rate or high 
dose. Even at high rate or high dose though, the incidence of pat·esthesia 
is less than expected for Oilantin given the hicidence for Fos. Taste 
perversion is an additional AE that appeared for Fos subjects but not 
Dilantin subjects. 
The sponsor does not address the reversibility of Fas-associated 
paresthesia, pruritus, and taste perversion directly in the ISS. 
Statements are made to the effect tnat these 3 AEs tend to be limited to 
the post··infusion times. Whether some subjects continued with these AEs 
is not directly obvious from reading the ISS. .... 
3.0 Completed Studies In Patlenta 
534 patients participated in completed clinical studies. The breakdown of 
these 534 patients has been presented above in 11Section 1.0 Exposure." 
In the ISS, the sponsor presents different cross-sectional views of AE 
data, but each is inadequate for not accounting for other relevant 
variables. For instance, a breakdown by route of administration does not 
account for whether the individual patients were given loading doses or 
maintenance doses. For this reason, I believe that only individual study 
reports are interpretable. Even these present problems by not controlling 
for rate and dose in may circumstances (see individual study reviews). 
The appropriateness of combining results from different studies in 
patients even when ostensibly the same medications were given by the 
same route and same dosing regimen (loading vs maintenance) can be 
questioned. For instance, patients in Studies 15 and 21 received IV 
loading doses of Fos or Dilantin. But the AE profile for the Dilantin arms 
of the two trials differ significantly (see tables of common AEs from 
these 2 trials on following pages). One possible explanation is that one 
study was tn neurosurgic&I patients and the other In epilepsy patients. 
lri Study 21 in epilepsy patients, nystagmus, dizziness, vertigo, and ataxia 
are reported ir. 38°/o, 38°/o, 23°/o, and 15°/o of patients respectively. In Study 
15 in neurosurgery patients, the same AEs are reported in 14°/o, 11°/o, 0°/o, 
and 7°/o ot patients respectivaly. All these ,".Es would be moie likely to be 
ascert&ined in an ambulatory, alert population like the epilepsy 
population. 
3.1 All AEs 
Sponsor!s Table 12 presents all AEs occurring in patients in completed

reviewing data present~·d this way. At the same time, no convincing 
advantages of Fo~ !Jver Dllantln emerge. 
While injec"\1on sit& pain is reported in 1.5°/o of Fos patients end 6.9°/o of 
Dilantin patients, the comparability of rate and dose of administration 
betweRn groups is not obvious. Likewise, while injection site reactian is 
reported in 2.8°/o of Fos p;..&tients and 4.9°/o of Dilantin patients, the rates 
and doses may not be comparable. Note that when data is grouped as it is

here for all patients, the term "injection site" could apply to either IM or 
IV injection site I 
On page 48 of the ISS, the sponso1 describes the experience with 
paresthesia and pruritus in more detail. For 13 patients treated with IV 
Fos, the investigator chose to manage the events by changing the infusion 
rate or administering medication (stAroids or antihistamines). The 
number of eventt. after IM Fos is not stated here, but no interventions 
were utilized. One patient withdrew because of severe pruritus that 
occurred with severe allergic reaction (Pt 13, Study 13, Center 1 ). 
Also on page 48, the sponsor reports that in completed patient studies, 
discrepancies between Fos and Dilantin treated patients with regard to 
pruritus and paresthesia were not as great as in the normal volunteer 
studies. This fact is misleading because the 2 different comparative 
studies in patients reported different experiences. With regard to 
paresthesia, Study 21 reported a 10°/o vs 0°/o incidence in paresthesia in 
favor of Dilantin. With regard to pruritus, Study 21 reported a 31 o/o vs 0°/o 
incidence in pruritus in favor of Ollantin. In short, in some patient 
studies, discrepancies in Fos and Dilantin treated subjects with regard to 
paresthesia and pruritus were as great as or greater than those seen in 
the norrnal volunteer studies. 
3.2 Common AEa Within the Two Actlve·Control Trlala 
The 2 active-control trials in the NOA differ in two respects: first, one 
had only an IV loading dose while the other had an IV load followed by IV 
maintenance dosing; second, one was in neurosurgery patients and one was 
in epilepsy patients. 
When the 2 Dilantin-control trials (Studies 15 and 21) are looked at 
separately, the magnitude of the discrf'pancies betwr,en Fos and Dilantin 
for certain AEs varies. 
For all studies combined, pruritus was reported in 5°/o Fas patients and 0°/o 
Dilantin patients. In Study 15 (neurosurgery patients), pruritus was 
reported in 6°/o Fon patients and 0°/o Oilantln patients. But in Study 21 
(epilepsy patients), pruritus was reported in 31 o/o Fos patients vs 0°/o 
Dilantin pathtnts.

Overall, in Study 21, the big differences in AEs between Fos and Dilantin 
occurred for pruritus (31 vs 0 °/o), paresthesia (10 vs O 0/o), neuropathy (B 
vs 0 °/o), and tremor (8 vs 0 o/o). 
Overall, in Study 15, the big differences in AEs between Fos and Dilantin 
occurrPd for pruritus (6 vs O %), increased reflexes (8 vs O 0/o), and 
injection site reaction (7 vs 18 %). 
Note that injection site reactions were not unusual in Study 15 and 
demonstrated a difference between Fos and Dilantin. In Study 21, only a 
single injection site reaction was reported (it happened to be hi a Fos 
patient) so that no difference between Fos and Dilantin was really 
demonstrated. In all likelihood, this difference betweAn studies was 
because Study 21 was only a single dose study while Study 15 
incorporated a loading dose followed by several days of maintenance 
dosing. (Another alternative explanation is that the Dilantin rates in 
Study 21 were lowered in 5 patients because of local pain, thereby 
decreasing the later emergence of injection site reactions in those 
patients.) 
One might infer from the last paragraph thai, for IV dosing, the advantage 
of Fos over Dilantin with regard to local tissue reactions rs confered only 
upon patients who receive maintenance dosing. However, in both Study 15 
and Study 21, the rates of infusion of the loading doses were so low as to 
contribute almost nothing to our understanding of IV loading in an 
emergent setting i.e. status epile~ticus where the bioequivalent rate of 
100-150 mg/min should be approached. In those situations of rapid 
infusion, local injection site reactions might occur with both Dilantin a11d 
Fos, perhaps even with an advantage for Fos. Unfortunately, a head-to­
head comparison of Dilantin and Fos in comparable rapid ii tfusions has only 
recently begun. Until that study is completed, no definitive statements 
about a Fos advantage over Dilantin for injection site reactions in 
emergent settings can be made. 
3.3 Common AEa • ., IV Maintenance Study 
The only study that really speaks to the safety of IV maintenance therapy 
is Study 15. As alluded to previously, this study in neurosurgical patients 
appears to underrepresent (in the face of comparable dose and rate} 
certain AEs which were shown in another study (Study 21) to occur with 
53 ... 
high frequency in another population (epilepsy). 
If exposure is assumed to be the same after IM maintenance therapy in 
neurosurgery patients, Study 14 (uncontrolled) can also be used to support 
IV maintenance therapy and, alternatively, Study 15 can be used to support 
IM maintenance therapy (albeit without the local IM safety data). 
3.4 "Slow" Loading Doses 
For all their differences, there are 4 studies (2 active .. control end 2 
uncontrolled) which support subacute loading doses. Studies 14 and 15 
were pf',rformed in neurosurgery patients and studies 21 and 22 were 
performeti in epilepsy patients. Studies 15 and 21 had IV loading doses 
while studies 14 and 22 had IM loading doses. 
3.5 "Rapid" IV Loading Doses 
Only one study, Study 16, really addresses the safety of IV ioading doses 
in status epilepticus. Thit~ was an uncontroBed study. 
Some comparative safety data on IV loading is accrued in Studies 15 and 
21 and, although bioequivalent rates were only rarely achieved in those 
studies, do provide some picture of comparative safety. 
In particular, one concern might be that significant AEs might be missed 
in Study 16 if the patients with status epitepticus were too obtunded to 
report them. Ir; Study 21 in epilepsy patients, obtundstion is not a 
problem so that reporting rates for some AEs would be expected to be 
higher, albeit with the less-than-bioequivalent rates. 
This indication is also the subject of a new active-control trial with 
Dilantin in which bioequivalent rates will be maintained. 
3.6 Rate-related AEs After IV Administration 
As in the normal volunteer studies, paresthesia and pruritus were rate­
related AEs in Fos patients. At rates that might bs bioequivalent, Dilantln 
patients had a 3-f old less incidence of paresthesia and no cases of 
pruri~•1s (co':'npared to a 28°/o incidence of pruritus in Fos patients). 
54 ... 
3. 7 Severe AEs 
Across all patient studies, there were 39 severe AEs among 534 Fos 
treated patients (7°/o). These AEs included ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, 
pain, nausea, ecchymosis, parestheaia, and pruritus. 
3.8 Frequent AEs by Gender 
Paresthesia and nystagmus were more common in men. Headache, 
pruritus, somnolence, and ecchymosis were more common in women. 
However, the sponsor has not adjusted the gender analysis for dose, rate, 
route, or clinical setting. 
3.9 Frequent AEs by Age 
Except for somnolence, the incid~nc!l of AEs in Fos patients was no 
different tor the 40-65 year old group compared to the > 65 year old group 
(n=67). Somnolence was more common in the > 65 age group. However, the 
~ponsor has not adjustc~ the gender analysis for dose, rate, route, or 
clinical setting. 
3.10 Frequent AEs by Race 
404 patients were white and 110 patients were black. 20 remam1ng 
patients represented other races. Headache, nausea, and paresthesia 
showed discrepant rates between white and black patients. Paresthesia 
occurred in 6°/o or white patients and only 1 o/o of black patients. However, 
the sponsor has not adjusted the gender analysis for dose, rate, route, or 
clinical setting. 
3.11 Clinical Labs 
No overall pattern of change in laboratory values emerges for any of the 
parameters reported by the sponsor in the ISS. More detailed reviews of 
patients with extremely high or low values of iab paiametars did not raise 
ar.y additional concern. Recall that many patients were only treated with 
a single loading dose of Fos and many patients had concomitant conditions 
that would be exr~ .. •cad to cause some lab abnormalities. No pattern of 
change in serum · : ~sphorus was noted. 
55 .... 
3.12 IM Local Tolerablllty 
Of the 357 patients who received at l~ast one IM injection, there were no 
severe injection site reactions. Two moderate inj~ctlon reactions 
occurred and thirty-one mild reactions occurred. 
3.13 IV Local Tolerability 
Of the 127 patients wh~ ; /,, ~·: °'J&~ at ittast one IV injecti ·11. there were no 
severe infusion~site re9,:tu.: · :':.t There was one moderate reaction and nine 
mild 1 eactions. 
3. ; 4 Oeaths, Ge;.iious A Es, arH.'! Withdrawals 
Eleven Cerebyx treated patients died. Ten of these deaths occurred in 
neurosurgery studies or status epilepticus studies. A review of these 
deaths raises no new concerns about Cerebyx. None of the deaths can be 
reasonably attributed to Cerebyx. 
A review of the serious AEs and the withdrawals raised no new concerns 
with regard to Cerebyx. The serious AEs that occur with Dilantin may also 
occur with Cerebyx.

June 23, 1995 
As per the adopted convention, all Fos doses and rates are expressed as mg 
phenytoin equivalents in this review. 
The cut-off for the safety database for this submission was Feb 22, 1995. 
Additionally, all deaths and serious adverse events through May 15, 1995 
are reported. 
In fact this SU only adds data on 12 additional patients, patients who 
were enrolled in the ongoing study of status epilepticus (SE). Thus a total 
of 66 pts with SE are included in the SU as opposed to 54 in the NOA. The 
SU presents cumulative data on exposure to Fos, demographics, safety, 
deaths, withdrawals due to AEs, and serious AEs for the 861 participants 
in trials. Also, AE data for the 90 participants exposed to Fos at doses cf 
at least 1 Omg/kg and rates. of at least 1 OOmg/min were examined.

t Jths and Serious AEs from NOA Cutoff Until Feb 22, 1995: 
Deaths: One additional death occurred since the filing of the NOA. 
Patient 16 from Study 16, died from an intracranial bleed that was 
present prior to Fas administration. 
Serious AEa: Four additional pts had serious AEs between NOA cutoff 
and Feb 22, 1995. Pt 16 from Study 16 is mentioned above under the 
category "deaths." Pt 20 from Study 16 developed apnea, CHF, and 
pulmonary edema. The pt had been treated for SE In the setting of a 
subdural hematoma; a history of IDDM was obtained. Apnea ocourred on 
day 2 and CHF on day 3. Pts 21 and 22 from Study 16 both developed 
postictal psychosis. All 3 pts with nonfatal serious AEs recovered. 
Withdrawals: No pts were withdrawn from Study 16 since the NOA was 
compiled. 
Deaths and Serioua A~s from Feb 22, 1995 Until May 15, 1995: 
Deaths: One additional death occurred. Pt 1 from Study 26 (an ongoing 
active control study of IV loading with Fos vs IV loading with Dilantin) 
developed cryptococcal meningitis in th9 setting of AIDS and died. 
Serious A Es: . Pt 2 from Study 26 was hospitalized for ; iED toxicity, 
which the investigator considered severe and possibly related to study 
medication. 5 days after treatment in the ER for seizures, the pt was 
admitted with phenytoin toxicity manifested by ataxia with a 1dvel of 30; 
he had been taking maintenance phenytoin, 400 mg/day. 
Note: Sp .... :"'sor's Appendix C.2 (not iiicluded) tabulates all deaths, serious 
AEs, and withdrawals because of AEs for the NOA and through May 15, 95. ... 
Demographics: The demographics of the pts with SE do not change with 
the addition of the 12 pts. 
Adverse Events: The AE tAbles on page 6·7 of the SU (not included) 
encompass all 7 48 subjects/pts exposed to Fos. Such a table is fairly 
uninformative, given the different routes of administration included. The 
addition of 12 pts to the 736 reported in the NOA did not change the AE 
profile. 
More relevant is the updated list of all AEs (as well as those deemed 
associated with use of drug) from Study 982-18 which occurs as 
Appendix 8.1 (not included) of the SU. The 12 additional pts with SE were 
treated under this protocol, with pts receiving IV loading doses of Fos. 
The predominant (>5°/o) AEs in Study ... are riystagmus (290/o), headache 
(15°/o), ataxia (14°/o), somnolence (12°/o), agitation (12%), vomiting (11 ~~). 
pruritus (9°/o), dizziness (8°10). dysarthria (6°/o), and fever (6°/o). 
Vital signs: Sponsor's Appendix B.2 from the SU (not included) provides 
the incidence of changes in systolic BP >20 mmHg from Study 16. 37/65 
(57°/o) pts had such a dec'"qase. The sponsor further divides this group by 
those with a "symptomatic · ecrease ," associated with the AE dizziness, 
vertigo, lightheadedness, or hypotension. 
Infusion site evaluations: Appendix 8.3 (not included) from the SU 
provides the incidence of local skin reactions from Study 16. Data are 
grouped for 24-hour posttreatment or discharge. If both 24 hour data and 
discharge data are available, it is not clear how the sponsor chose one 
over the other. The way the da•a are collected, mild tenderness, swelling, 
bruising, and erythema are reported for 3-8°/o of pts. One pt had moderate 
bruising. 
Clinical lab data: The sponsor states that no clinically significant 
changes were noted for the 12 additional pts in the SU.

17 came from Study 21, a atudy In pta who almpl~' •required a loading do11 
of phenytoin." The 12 new treated pta in thla SU all came from Study 18, 
but only 11112 are included In thl1 cohort of high doae/hlgh rate pta. 
At tttla point In time, only 35 lndlvldual1 have been do1ed at 
1 &tT,g/kg or greater, 11 well •• 1 IOtng/mln. 
Sponsor's Tables 5 and e summarize th• breakdown of AE1 by dose and 
rate for the 90 individual aubject1 1xpo11d. (Note that th111 Tabl11 wire 
reformatted by the aponaor at my r1qu11t 10 that pt1 tr1at1d at the higher 
doses and rates are not Included in the column• for th• lower do111 and 
rates as they were ln the original tables.) Tht 1pon1or c,,nclud11 that 11an 
increased incidence of AE1 wa1 not 1hown for 1uco111lv1 lnor1ment1 of 
partlctpanta ln thia aubgroup treated with incr1a1ing do111 and rat11. In 
particular, cardlova1cular evente occurred at a 1imllar lnctdence aoro11 
groups and did not appear to be related to the do11 or rat• of foaphanytoln 
adminlatratlon." 
However, there are aeveral problems with lnferenc11 drawn from Tablas 5 
and 6. Fir1t, the denominators at any do11 or rate window will be tow, 10 
that we cannot be eure we have captured the true AE profile with any 
certainty. Second, there 11 no control group. In particular, It would be 
intere1Ung to compare the AE profUe between pt1 randomized to 
phenytoln at 50mg/mln v1 Fo1 at 150mg/mln. Thia latter Information i1 
being collected in the 1pon1or'a ongoing 1tudy, Study 28. Finally, recall 
that these pt• are often obtunded and cannot report 1om1 AE1 that an 
awake, alert pt could report. 
Literature Review: The 1pon1or'1 literature revlew cov1r1 th1 ttm1 
period through March 10, 1995. Ont report of phl1bltl1 In a Foa tr1at1d pt 
60 la included. The aponaor maintain• that, beeauae of the mild tendernesa 
alone, a clinical dl1gno1i1 of phlebttle waa not appUcabtt. Thia la an 
important l11u1 In that the 1pon1or h11 propo11d a lower incidence of 
phlebitis with Foa than with parenteral Otlantln. 
Sponaor'• Conolualona: The 1p:ln1or maintains that the 11f1ty profile 
h11 not ch1tnged with the addtttonat tnfor;Tiltion provided In the SU. Th• 
aponaor maintain• that: 
1. Overall, the AE profile of Foa ta almllar to that of parenteral OUantin. 
2. IV Fos Is associated with f1wtr infusion 1it• r1ac.Uof\1 than IV 
Dllantln (I.e. 1111 pain and burning). 
3. IM Foa produced no more lnj1ctton alt• reaotiona than placebo. 
4. Hlgh·do11, hlgh·rate Foa IV (i.e. the bloequlvalent dolt and rate) h11 no 
more AE• 111ocl1t1d with It than lowtr·doao, tower-rate Foa. 
R1vl1w1r'1 Conolu1lon1: No 1ignlflc1nt change In tht 11f•tv profile of 
Foa has ariaen Wfth th1 addition of the 12 new p1tt1nt1. The 1poneor'1 4 
polnt1 above can b1 1ddre111d •• f oltowa: 
1 ; The AE profile• of Foa and parenteral Oltantln mu1t be compared by 
route of admtnlatratlon. Further, only randomized trlal1 that are 
adequately powered to detect a dlff 1r1no1 betwttn tr1atm1nt1 can truly 
•••••• th1 oomparablllty of treatments. 
2. IV Foa at hlgh-do11, high·rate 1dmini1tratton (the bioequlval1nt do•• 
and rate) h11 only' been glv1n to 38 lndlvldua11. Tht 1pon1or'1 lit1r.,turt 
review demon1tr1t11 that IV Fo1 11 not without 1om1 rlak of local 
irritation~ any 11Um1t1 of th• lncld1no1 of lnfualon 1lt1 r11ctlon1 mu1t 
be 10 lmpracl11 11 to pr1clud1 any 1t1t1m1nt1 in fa var of flo1. 
61 3. Th• statement about IM Foe may t,e correct baaed on a study where IM 
maintenance therapy w11 1tudt1d. Whether this hold• true for IM loading 
wlth Foa te unknown. 
4. Th• populatlon1 of pta that r101lv•d high·do11, hlgh·r•t• Foa and 
lowar-doaa, low1.·-rat1 Fo1 may be 10 different •• ~o preclude any 
atatementa about the 11f1ty of one regimen vo the other. (I 1u1p1ct that 
pta with SE ware more llkely to r101lv1 the more aggr111lv1 r1gtm1na. 
Th111 pta might be 1lok1r on 1v1rag1 and thua 1111 llkely to report ev1nt1 
auch aa dlzzln111 or tinnitus.) Only a randomlt•d study can 1n1wer thle 
qu11tton. 
Looking at IV loadlng do••• alone, Foa, at th• blo1qulvalent dose and 
rate, h11 th• pottntlal to oau11 local r1actlon1 and ha• b11n 1hown to 
caua• hypot1n1lon (11 d1fln1d by > aommHg drop in SBP) tn !7% of pta. 
The advantage• of IV Fos are: 1) It can b1 given In 1/3 the time required 
to give an equlmolar do11 of Dllantln; and 2) It la more oompatlble with 
other IV flutd1 and drugs than Oilantln. 
IV m1lntenanc1 Foa has th• 11me two adv1nt1g11 over Dllantln. 
IM loadlng with Foa la tolerated. while Dllantln 11 reported to cause 
local Irritation and unpredictable 1y1temic absorption. The SU haa not 
changed the databaae to either aupport or r1fut1 the uae of IM loading with 
Foe. 
IM m1lnten1no• with Fo1 pre1ent1 the same 1ltu1tlon aa IM loading. 
Again the SU has not changed the position of Foa In thla regard.

Second Safety Update 
October 31, 1995 
November 4, 1995 
As per the adopted convention, all Fos doses and rates ar1 expressed as mg 
phenytoln equivalents (PE) In this review. 
The cut-off for the safety database for this submission was Aug 1, 1995. 
Additionally, all deaths and serious adverse events through Sept 15, 1995 
are reported. 
In fact this SU adds data on 111 additional patients 1inoe the first safety 
update. The sponsor teports that the safety profile of Cerebyx in the 
safety update is consirnent with that reported in the NOA and first eafety 
update. 
Since the first safety update, 3 deaths, 4 serious AEa, and 8 withdrawals 
due to AEs have occurred in 8 Cereoyx treated patients. The 3 deaths were 
due to cerebral edema, accldental drowning, and GI bleeding. Reasons for 
withdrawal included generalized Itching, burntng and itching, nausea and 
itching, hypotension, and agitation. 
All 111 new exposures to Cerebyx were to the IV formulation. No new IM 
data is provided. 
Data from 2 studies Initiated and completed since the aubmlaelon of thd 
NOA and first safety update are Included, Study 27 and Study 26. TABLE 1. Number of Parric::ipants and Time Periods Covered in Safety

69 Study 27 
The final study report for Study 27 is not provided. 
This was an open-label single dose study in which 16 normal volunteers 
received 1200mg Fas at 150mg/mln. There were no deaths, no serious 
AEs, or withdrawals due to AEs. No slowing or discontinuation of 
infusions because of AEs Is speclfloally reported. 
226 AEs were reportf'd. 108 were mild, 108 were moderate. 12 were 
severe in intensity. The severe AEs included: 
prurltus 4 events 
paresthesia 2 events 
dizziness 2 ev~nts 
aching knees 1 event 
pelvic pain (burning) 1 event 
asthenla 1 event 
tinnitus 1 event 
"The duration of the event . 0. was <30 minutes for 7 subjects, <2 hours for 
2 subjectR, <5 hours for 1 subject, and <21 hours for 2 subjects." 
Injection-site syni,,toms including Inflammation and reaction were 
experienced by J subjects and were all rated mild In htenaity. 
75°/o of subjec~s experi4itnced pare1thaala. 76°/o of subjects experienced 
pruritus. 
The sponso,. reports no changes in ECGa or clintcal labs of clinical 
significance. One subject experionced a drop in BP to 67/43 1 O minutes 
after Infusion. 
In reviewing the clinical lab data listings, I note that 9 subjects had 
ioni?ed free calcium lavela checked at variable times after infusion. All 
of the values reported are unremarkable. 5 of the 9 had free calcium 
lttvels checked immediately after the Infusion. The sponsor makea no 
comment about these specific I eve le and their aignlficance. 
In reviewing the cUnical lab data Ustlnga, 
checked at frequent interval• after do1lng. 
70 also noted bicarb levels were 
It appears that baseline levels dip by a small increment for some patients, while patient 16 had a level 
below the stated normal rahga. Again the sponsor does not comment on 
these levels. 
Study 26 
This was a 112 patient, double·bllnd, randomized, parallel study of an IV 
loading dose of fosphanytoin vs. an IV loadlng dose of phenytoin. Patlents 
were randomized In a 4:1 ratio to foa vs phenytoin. The 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria did not specify particular diagnostic 
categories of patitints to be Included; rather pts who required a loading 
dose of phenytoin were to be included. Broadly speaking, this would 
include pts who were In status epilepticus as well as many other patients. 
Pts received equimolar amounts of fos or phenytoin. The bloequivalent 
infusion rates (based on free phanytoin levels) were used so that the time 
of infusion was approximately 7 minutes for fos and 20 mlnutna for 
phenytoln. The total dose was to be 20mg/kg phenytoln equivalents (PE) 
except for patients with baseline phenytoln levels or patients over 65 
years of age who received 1 Smg/kg. 
90 patients received Cerebyx while 22 received Dllantln. The study was 
started in April, 1995 and completed in June, 1995. 
Roughly half the patients In each treatment group were epilepsy patients: 
roughly a third of the patients in each treatment group were neurosurgery 
patient.o. Only 2 patients with status epilepticus ware antwred and both 
were in th~ Cerebyx arm of the trial. 
14°/o of C&rebyx patients had the infusion modified because of AEa: 2°/o had 
the infusion modified because of AEs and pump problems. 50°/o of Dilantin 
patients had the Infusion modified because of AEs; 14°/o had the infusion 
modified because of AEa and pump problems. The predominant reason for 
modifying the infusion ln Dllantin patients wa1 the occurrence of local 
injection site pain. The predominant reason for modifying the infusion in 
Cereby>< paUenta waa the occurrence of more generalized Itching and 
tingling, especially In the groin and lower extremities.

~ Sponsor'• Dtacuaelon: In th!s second safety update, the sponsor 
acknowledges the occurrence of prurltus In Cerebyx-treated subjects and 
patients. The sponsor comments that other phosphate eater prod rugs, 
Decadron and Hydrocortone, cau~• a burning sensation in the groin area. 
The sponsor states that Foacavir in the treatment of CMV retinitis causes 
tingling. The spCJnsor draws attention to the fact that, In Study 26, 
infusions were interrupted more often with Dllantin than with Cerebyx. 
The sponsor acknowledges that Interruptions require patients to be awake; 
the sponsor states that patients were, as a rule, awake in Study 26, 
although specific treatment group comparisons of level of consciousness 
are not presented. 
My Commanta: After reviewing the sponsor's references on Decadron and 
Hydrocortone, I am impressed by the similarities between the character 
and the location of the sensory disturbance that those drugs create and 
that Cerebyx creates. Specifically, Cerebyx, like Oacadron and 
Hydrocortone, seems to cause a burning and Itching which predominates 1n 
the groin area. The intensity of the disturbance seems less with Decadron 
ana Hydrocortone, but the loading dose of these drugs would deliver only 
1 /20th-1/10th the phosphate that a loading dose of Cerebyx would 
deliver. Could phosphate alone cause this characteristic sensory 
disturbance ? If so, are there any intermediate steps required, for 
instance, the induction of hypocalcemia via calcium-phosphate 
precipitation ? 
My e&nswer to the last question would be, perhaps not. The sensory 
disturbance described in hypocalcemia is usually a tingling that localizes 
to the face and hands. While tingling Is also described in Cerebyx-treated 
patients, burning and itching predominate In the da.scrlptlons provided. 
Further, the burning and Itching with Cerebyx is ott\tn immediate In onset, 
suggesting a minimal number of steps to cause the phenomenon. Also, free 
calcium levels were checked in 5 subjects in Study 27 immediately after 
infusion and were normal. (Not stated was whether these same 5 subjects 
had sensory disturbances.) 
The sponsor mentions Foscavir as another drug that causes sensory 
disturbances. My understanding is that Foacavir Is not broken down to 
80 phosphate, but rather is excreted unchanged in the urine. It Is believed 
that FoscavJr actually chetates calcium causing a transient hypocalcemla 
which, In turn, causes the characteristic sensory disturbance of 
hypocalcemla (tingling in the face and hands). Therefore, I do not think 
Foscavlr-lnduced sensory phenomena are parallel to Cerebyx-induced 
sensory phenomena. 
From Studies 26 and 27, I believe the sponsor could provide a much better 
description of the sensory disturbance caused by the SE dosing regimen of 
Cerebyx. Currently, I have only bean provided narrative accounts for 
patlents and subjects who had "serious" AEs. Patients who had "severe11 
but-not "serious" sensory disturbances are of special Interest. For these 
patients, I think we need to know the duration of sensory disturbance.

A. Study Dealgn 
This was a 5-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
of IM Fos. By protocol, adult pta were considered for Inclusion If they 
were taking oral Dllantln for the treatment of epilepsy or seizure 
prophylaxis, had stable blood phenytoin levels, and were maintaining a 
record of their seizures. 
Pts tn one group (250/o of total N) were to continue receiving their oral 
Dilantin dose along with IM placebo. Pts in the other group (75°/o of the 
total N) were to receive placebo orally along with IM Foa. 
Sponsor's Table 3, a schedule of time and even~~. is attached. After each 
injection, subjective evaluations of any irritation produced by the 
injections were to be made by the patient and the Investigator. Seizures 
were to be recorded. One week after the laat lnjectlon, a final physical 
exam was to be performed. 
85 A subset of pts at a single study site (N=24) was to have a more extensive 
PK evaluation. Tht' rest of the pts had determinations made of plasma 
phenytoln levels lmmeoiately before double-blind treatment and again on 
the fifth day of treatment. 1 he subset of 24 pts had to be on a OD regimen 
and had plasma sampies collected on Day • 1 before doaing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post dosing. On Days 1 ·4, samples were collected 
before dosing. On Day 5, samples were collected before dosing and 0.5, 1 , 
1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post dosing. Samples were 
analyzed for total and free phenytoln levels and Fos levels. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria were as follows: 
o Pts with epilepsy or recovering from neurosurgery 
o 18 years of age and older 
a On a stable dose of oral Dllantin for treatment or prophylaxis 
o Oral regimen OD or BID 
o Phenytoin levels between 10-20, with 2 samples between 1-4 
weeks apart within 4 weeks of atudy entry which are within 30o/o of one 
another 
o Hllve a written record of seizures for at least 28 days (if being 
treated for epilepsy) 
o Not on more than 2 drugs to control seizures 
o Absence of life-threatening dl&ease 
Injections were given In the gluteus maximus and could be divided Into 2 
equal injections given in separate location• If the dose required a !arge 
volume. The pt was to rate on a 4 point scale the extent of pain, lt<:hlng. 
and burning immediately after injection and again at 5, 30, 80, and 120 
min post-injection, and Immediately prior to the next injection. 
The attending investigator would examine the site of Injection at 5 and 30 
min, and 1 and 2 hr after injection and again Immediately prior to the next 
injection. A subjective rating of Injury and local irritation was to be 
made using a 4 point scale applied to the 4 symptoms: rednaas, swelling, 
tenderness, and necrosis. 
The dose of oral and IM study medication could be adjusted to matntatn 
therapeutic blood _,concentrations and to minimize phenytoin toxicity. 
The protoeot·specifled analyals plan was vague beyond stating that local 
86 irritation would be compared between groups. It was statsd that analyses 
of both safety and efficacy would be stratified based on whether the drug 
was given as prophylaxis or as treatment for epilepsy. 
The efficacy analysis was likewive vague other than to say that 
comparisons between treatment groups would be made for seizure control, 
looking at the treatment period as well as the Immediate pre-and post­
treatment periods. 
"The sample size of 200 was not chosen based on statistical 
considerations. This number of pts, added to those In other studies, is 
intended to demonstrate safe passage of pts treated with Fos in a samJ,;!e 
of over 500 pts and normal volunteers." 
B. Subject Diapoaltlon and Baaelln• Comparison 
The first pt entered the study on April 23, 1991 and the last pt completed 
the study on December 30, 1991. 240 pts were randomized; 5 pts in the 
Fos group did not receive all 5 days of dosing and 1 additional pt who did 
receive 5 days of dosing did not return for the follow-up visit. 
By design. pts could receive medication OD or BID; in fact, all pts received 
their medication OD. One treatment group consisted of 179 pts. The other 
treatment group consisted of 61 pts. The two treatment groups were 
similar in demographic characteristics. 95°/o of pts In both groups carried 
a diagnosis of epilepsy; only 6 pts in one group and 3 pts In the othAr were 
neurosurgery pts who required seizure prophylaxis. The moan daily dose 
of Dilantin was 375mg. with a range of 200·500mg. 
The two treatment groups were balanced with respect to the concurrent 
AED medications used. 70°/o of pts took no other AEDs. 9· 10°/o of pts took 
concurrent phenobarb. 9-10°/o of pte took concurrent VPA. 7-8°/o of pts 
took concurrent carbamazepine. 
·17 4/179 pts in the Fos group received all 5 days of treatment. 61 /61 pts 
in the Dilantin group received all 5 days of treatment. 
During the treatment phase. 13 Fos pts had thelt· dose adjusted. 5/13 had 
doses towered because of AEs such as contusion, ataxia, dizziness, and 
87 nystagmus. 2/13 had doses raised because of poor aeizura control. 5/13 
had dose adjustments because plasma levels were either too high (2) or 
too low (3): recall that the protocol called for level• durlnt:: the treatment 
phase only In pts In the PK spacial study group. 1/13 had th• doaw; lowered 
a imply due to noncompliance. 
2 pta withdrew because of AEs. 2 pta withdrew because of 
"administrative" reasons. A fifth pt In the Foa group did not receive all 5 
doses, but completed the study visits. 
Protocol variations that could impact on interpretation of focal trrttatton 
were as follows: 
nonalternatlng sides for medication Injection In 75 pta 
multiple injection sites in 7 pta 
multiple injections for a given dose not of equal volume In 5 pts 
In 26 pta, at least one phenytoin level during 1cr11n w11 1111 than 1 o. In 
3 pts, the 2 plasma levels during screen were not within 300/o of each 
other. 
C. Raaulta 
Given the multiple tests for local irritation performed by both the pt1 and 
physicians, along with the multiple time points at which these tests were 
performed for each injection, and the 5 different lnj1ctlon1, It ta hard to 
envision a statistic that would capture all this data In a meaningful way. 
Suffice it to say that a visual screen of all the ll1tlnga for local akin 
irritation reveal no cllnloally significant dlff1r1nce1 between Fos and 
placebo injections, other than a slight increase in ml•d to mod•rate 
itching within the first hour after injection. 
No deaths occurred during the study. 2 pta withdrew from the Fos group 
because of AEa. 1 pt experienced a aerioua AE in the Foa group. 'The one 
serious AE reported was phenytoin toxicity. The pt recovered completely 
after withdrawal from the study; the lnv11tlgator noted that the pt had 
taken some additional do1e1 of Ollantln from her own supply on Daya 1 and 
2 of treatment. The other withdrawal waa due to an attergtc reaction and 
pruritus, with fufl recovery off treatment. (Recall that pt1 had been 
expo1ed to ph•nytoin chronically before entering the 1tudy: exposure to Fos was not the pt'a first exposure to phanytotn.) 
The percent of pts reporting any AEa wa1 11tghtty higher In the Fos group 
(88o/a) compared to the placebo group (62"/o). 
There was a higher incidence of nyatagmu1, lncoordlnatlon, headache, 
nauaaa, and prurltua in the Foa group. 
During the study, 8 pta experienced AE1 that were rated .. 1ev1r1" in 
Intensity, 4 on Foa and 2 on placebo. In the Foa group, one pt was 
dlacuaaed above as the wlthdrawal for allergic reaction and prurltua. 
There waa one caae each of severe nauaea, vomiting, and migraine. In the 
placebo group, there w11 one case of dlzzln111 that re1pond1d to a reduced 
dose, and one case of local excision of a breast laalon. 
The incidence of seizures during treatment differed between the Fos and 
placebo groups (18% vs 10%). In particular, Foa pta had a high incidence 
of partial complex 1eizure1 (11 %) compared to placebo (2%). Two Foa pt1 
required dose adju1tmenta because of poor aeizure control. Moat pta 
experienced no aelzurea In either treatment group 10 that the aponaor's 
comparison of average number of 1eizur11 per day between treatment 
groups Is not very Instructive. The aponaor acknowledges that the latter 
la highly influenced by a single patient with a large number of 11izure1. 
,The sponsor reports 1ome additional analy1e1 which compare change from 
baseline to treatment period or change from treatment period to peat· 
treatment; no atatlatlcally slynlfloant dlfter1nc11 were found. 
Blood pressure, heart rate, and r11plr1Uon rate were recorded in relation 
to Fos injections. No clinically Important trend• were noted In any of 
these paramotera following Foa Injection, although 2-3 pt1 were noted to 
have blood pressures as low aa 90/60 30·60 mlnutoa after Fos Injection. 
Pt 11-13 who discontinued because of dizziness had a BP of 90/60 30 
minutes post·doae with a pre-dose pre11ura of 110/70. No pr111ura1 
tower than 90/80 were noted for any pt at any time. 
To determine any trend toward abnormal lab values during the study, pts 
were categorized aa to whether their lab values were below, within. or 
above normal range at ba1elln1 and at th• end of treatment. Changes to 
low or high from the 1creening value to the flrat follow-up visit ware 
aummarized. The sponsor notaa that no con1l1tent dlff1renc11 or clinically Important trends were evident. Changes from normal at screen 
to low at flu occurred for at least 10% of pta in either group for RBC 
count. wee count, and calcium. 
Detalled PK Analy1l1: At Canter 3, evaluable data waa available for 13 pta 
out of a targeted population of 24. The 1pon1or 1xplaln1 that for 7 of the 
remaining 11 pta. 1ampl11 were collected In heparlnlzed tub11 which were 
later found to Interfere with Foa measurements. The remaining 4 pta 
were tn the oral Dllantln/IM placebo group and ware therefore not Included 
in the analyaea. For the 13 avalfabla, 11mpl11 had bean drawn at baseline 
at numerous tlmaa In relation to oral doae adminlatratlon: on day 6. 
samples again were drawn at numerous times In relation to IM Foa 
administration. The ratios for Day 5 (IM Foa)/B.iaelina (oral Ollantln) are 
as follows: 
Total Phenytoln 
Cmax 1.21 
Tmax 0.66 
AUC 1.05 
Free Phanytoln 
Cmax 1.32 
Tmax 0.42 
AUC 1.18 
The increaae1 in Cmax and AUC might be explained by th1 lncr1aaed 
bloavallablllty of Foa (1008/o) rel"tlve to oral Dllantln (90%). The more 
marked Increases In free phenytoln following IM Foa might be conalatent 
with displacement of phenytoln from pla1ma protein binding 1tt11 by Foa. 
Overall PK Analysis at All Centers: A trend analy1i1 waa uaad to 
determine if there ware dlfferencea tn trough concantrattona between 
treatment groups over time. 20 pta who required changes In dosage during 
the study were •~eluded from the analy1l1; data ware available for 165 
Foa treated pta and 55 Dllantln traat•d pts. The results showed that the 
mean trough concentratlona of total phenytoin provided by Foe lnoreaaed 
slightly from the first day through the follow-up visit, while the mean 
trough levels provtdeC: by Otlanttn orally tended to stay the aama. The 
Increase in trough level• •••n with Foa may be con1l1tent with the 
complete bloavallabUlty of IM Foa. 
90 D. Conclualona 
The PK data from this trial needs further Blopharm review. Based on the 
sponsor's presentation of the data, It appears that an IM dose of Fos may 
be substituted tor an equtmolar oral do11 of Dllantln, achieving plasma 
levels of total phanytoln and free phenytoln which are roughly 200/o higher. 
The AE profile of IM Fos r•flacta an Increased Incidence of nyatagmus, 
lncoordinatlon, nausea, and headache, all of which might bt expected with 
higher phenytotn and frt• phenytoin levela. The Increased Incidence of 
prurttua with IM Fos la unexpected based on higher ph1nytoln levels alone, 
but would not preclude use of IM Fos. 
Perhaps the pts who would benefit most by IM Fos would be chronically 
Dilantin·treated pta who have a transient 2·3 day gaatrolntestlnal 
disturbance which prevents oral medication, but la tran1l1nt and not 
expected to require IV access for hydration or caloric Intake. 
Because of the delayed Tmax of total phenytoln and free ph1nytoln after IM 
Fas, IM Fos is not an alternative route of phenytoln administration In pts 
with st.-tua epUapticus.

A. Study Design 
The study was intended to be a safety study. The projected enrollment 
was 150 patients. 
Patients were to be candidates for neurosurgery or patients who had 
already undergone neurosurgery. Open-label treatment was to consist of a 
single loading dose followed by maintenance dosing for at least 3 days and 
for a maxin•um of 7 days (changed by amendment to 14 days). Patients 
were to return 2·4 days after the last injection for follow-up exams and 
proct.Jdures. A subset of patients at a single sit~ (n=10) were to have PK 
determinations performed at various timepoints following injections. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria dictated that patients be 12 years of age or 
older. Pts were not to be have terminal illnesses or other llfe-
threat~n ing diseases. 
To be excluded were pts with hypotension, bradycardia, and A-V block. 
Pts were excluded if they took any AED except benzodiazepines within 1 
week prior to screen. 
No medications were specifically excluded during the study. Any IV 
medications other than the study medication were to be administered at a 
96 site different from that used for study drug. 
By protocol the study drug could be administered either QD or BID as 
deemed appropriate by the investigator to achieve therapeutic 
concentrations of at least 10 .. 20 microgms/mL. A protocol amendment 
required QD dosing only. Page 7 of the protocol Implies that the loading 
dose would be 8-12 mg/kg PE. 
The dosing administration could be divided and given in separate locations 
on the buttock. 
During the treatment period, a trough blood phenytoin was to be drawn 
each day, prior to the patient receiving the first daily dose of study 
medication. 
B. Subject Dlapoattlon and Baseline Comparison 
The study was conducted between July 1991 and April 1992. 
The study population included 78 mates and 40 females, 93 whites and 25 
blacks. The mean age was 48 years. 
The pts were seriously ill neurosurgery pts who were victims of trauma 
to the head or other neurological emergencies, the most common of which 
were motor vehicle accidents and gunshot wounds. Over 1/5 pts were 
unconscious when they entered the study, and over 1/2 pts had a level of 
consciousness that was lethargic or worse. 
110 pts completed treatment. 80 pts completed the follow-up 
assessments. 8 pts withdrew, 6 for admin reasons and 2 for A Es. 
118 patients were given a loading dose between 8·21.6 mg/kg PE. 
Maintenance doses ranged from 1. 7-17 .2 mg/kg. Maintenance doses were 
given either OD or BID. 64 pts received OD doses, 45 pts received BID 
doses, and 9 pts received both OD and BID doses. 
While the maximum treatment duration was extended by protocol 
amendment from 7 days to 14 days, only 5 pts received treatment for 8 
days or greater. 
97 C. Results 
Eight pts withdrew from the study, 2 for administrative reasons and 6 
because of AEs. Only 1/6 experienced an event that was considered drug 
related, an erythematous rash. At the follow-up visit, most of the rash 
had resolved. 
Four pts who withdrew from the study died. Three other pts died after 
completing the study. 
At any one timepoint, a maximum of 3 pts experienced mild Irritation at 
the injection sitt>. 
Note that the AE data was grouped across the entire study and was not 
separated according to loading vs maintenance dosing. Altogether, 75°/o of 
pts reported AEs: only 8°/o of pts overall had AEs that were considered 
associated with study drug. The most frequent A Es were fever, 
somnolence, and nystagmus. 5% of pts experienced at least one seizure 
during open-label treatment; without a comparative treatmen·i group, it is 
hard to interpret this finding. 
Ten pts experienced serious AEs, but none of these were considered 
associated with study drug. 
Changes from baseline in laboratory parameters occurred not infrequently 
during this study. However, given the population of seriously ill trauma 
patients requiring neurosurgery, no inferences can be made from the lab 
data. 
For each patient studied, the mean trough phenytoin concentration for the 
study duration was > 10. Recall that daily trough concentrations were 
measured and doses adjusted to keep the daily levels > 1 o. 
D. Conclualona 
In a seriously ill neurosurgical population, the sponsor has demonstrated 
that plasma levels of phenytoln > 1 O can be achieved and maintained. No 
safety concerns obviously related to Fas arose during tha conduct of the 
study, but the ntitural tendency in this population ls to attribute all A Es to the underlying condition or the treatment of the underlying condition. Mild 
to moderate AEs will be overshadowed by more serious AEs In this 
population. 
No efficacy data arises from this study. The occurrence of seizures in 
some patients despite plasma level& of phenytoin > 10 was documented, 
but is not surprising given the severity of the •Jnderlylng conditions.

A. Study Design 
This was a double-blind, parallel-group, active control trial In patients 
requiring a loading dose of phenytoin to prevent or control seizures. Pts 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1 :3 ratio 
to receive either parenteral Dilantin or Fosphenytoin. 
The objectives of the study were 1) to evaluate the safety and tolerance 
of multiple IV doses of Fas for seizure prophylaxis in neurosurgery 
patients and 2) to obtain descriptive PK data for Fos in this patient 
population. 
The study had 3 phases: 
1 . Screening phase 
2. Treatment phase, Days 1·14 
3. Follow-up phase for 2-4 days following the last IV dose 
The treatment phase included a loading dose on Day 1 followed by daily IV 
maintenance infusions. HAt the preatudy investigators meeting, the 
100 minimum exposure requirement was defined as 72 hours, i.e. a loading 
dose followed by 2 days of maintenance dosing." 
Pts at Center 5 had serial blood samples drawn over a 24 hour period 
beginning on the day of loading dose to determine total and free phenytoln 
concentrations In plasma. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 12 years of age or older. 
Patients were to require neurosurgery or were to have undergone 
neurosurgery. Pts were to be scheduled for neurosurgery within 14 days 
of entry into double-blind treatment. 
To be excluded were pts with hypotension, bradycardia, and A·V block. 
Pts vvere excluded If they took any AED except benzodiazepines within 1 
week prior to screen. 
No medications were specifically excluded during the study. Any IV 
medications other than the study medication were to be administered at a 
site different from that used for study drug by using a second IV line. 
By protocol, study drug could not be administered at rates greater than 50 
mg/mii 1 either for loading or maintenance. The study drug could be 
administered either OD or BID as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
The study was conducted between July 1992 and February 1993. 
In general, patients were seriously ill neurosurgery patients who were 
suffering from head trauma or other neurological emergencies. With rare 
exceptions, patients underwent neurosurgical procedures on Study Day 1. 
88 pts received IV Fos while 28 pts received IV Dllantln. The loading dose 
of Fos was given as a total dose between 7.3·22.4 mg/kg PE at infusion 
rates between 14-51 mg/min PE. Dilantln was given as a total dose 
between 7.8·19.8 mg/kg at infusion rates between 21·51 mg/min. 
Maintenance doses of Fos were given as total doses of 1.2-23 mg/kg PE at 
infusion rates between 3. 1-62.1 mg/min PE. Maintenance Dilantin was 
given as total doses of 1.3· 18.4 mg/kg at Infusion rates between 5.1-50 mg/min. 
No patients received concurrent antlepileptlc drugs during the screening 
phase of the study. Thus, patients should not have had baseline levels of 
phenytoin or any other AEO. During the treatment phase, 4 pts received 
phenytoin in an unblinded fashion (3 Foe, 1 Dtlantfn), 3 pta received 
diazepam, and 2 pta received lorazapam. 
Concurrent mads, other than AEDa, ware In large part dictated by the 
individual's neurosurgery status. 108 pta aotuaUy had surgery during the 
study. 27/108 had surgery before beginning treatment with study drug. 
79/108 had neurosurgery during the study. 2/108 had surgery after 
completing the study. Thus, 44% of pts were taking CNS agents at screen 
and this increased to 96°/o during double·bllnd treatment. The most 
common CNS agents were acetaminophen, fentanyl, codeine, and morphine. 
To further complicate all this, we are told that 1m11t numbers of pts 
received BID maintenance dosing instead of QO, whlle 1imllarly small 
numbers of pts received maintenance dosing as OD medication some days 
and BID medication other days. 
14 pts withdrew from the study, 4 because of A Es and 1 O for 
administrative reasons. Only 4 pts in each treatment group were treated 
for more than 7 days. 
C. Reaulta 
Because the loading dose of Fos was not given at the bioequivalent rate of 
administration. this study cannot provide comparable safety data between 
an IV loading dose of Fos and an IV loading dose of Ollantin. 
Comparable safety data between IV maintenance regtmena of IV Fos and IV 
Dilantin is provided. One death occurred in each treatment group, 
unrelated to the treatment itself. One 11rlou1 AE occurred In the Fos 
group and 2 serious AEs occurred in the Dllantln group: none were deemed 
related to the underlying treatment. Among AEs deemed associated with 
treatment, there was only 1 severe AE and this occurred In the Fos group: 
severe ataxia. 
Among a listing of all AEs, the obvious diacrepanclea between treatment groups occur for injection site reaction, lnjectton site pain, and prurltua. 
The trend is for more local reactions with Ollantln and more generalized 
pruritua with Fos. 
Seizures were so rare in both treatment groups that no meaningful 
statement about the anticonvulsant properties of either treatment can be 
made. 
The sponsor (p 49 of the study report) presents changes in vital sign data 
between screening and 2 hours post loading dose for the 2 treatment 
groups. There are no obvious differences between treatment gr-;>ups. 
Changes seen In laboratory parameters during the study were felt to be 
~ost consistent with the population being studied, i.e. Ill neurosurgery 
patients. 
PK data was also accrued which demonstrates roughly equivalent trough 
levels of phenytoln with both the IV Fos and IV Dllantin regimens. During 
treatment, dose was adjusted by the Investigators based on plasma 
phenytoin monitoring. The extrapolation of this might be that IV Foa can 
be used to achieve and maintain therapeutic plasma phenytoln 
concentrations while monitoring trough plasma phenytoln levels. 
On page 65 of the study report, the sponsor summarizes changes in rates 
of infusion. Presumably, these changes pertain primarily to the loading 
doses administered. 17°/o of Fos pts and 36°/o of Ollantln pta required 
decreases In rates. Note, however, that the bloequlvalent rate of Fos 
administration for IV loading was not given. Thus, a comparison of 
proportions of pts requtring dose reductions under the conditions of 
bioequivalence might have resulted in very different results. 
The same problem In comparing groups arises when comparing groups for 
dose reductions due to injection site burning and Itching. 5°/o of Fos pts 
required this while 180/o of Dilantin pts required this. RR-REO 720..0344 l .58 -·f· ., J ' ... '~

A. Study Dealgn 
This was an open-label, single dose study in status epllep!icus. 
The objectives of the study were to 1) establish the safety of two rates 
of IV Fos In pts with status and 2) obtain descriptive PK data. 
By protocol, the first 1 O patients would receive Foa up to a maximum rate 
of 100 mg PE/min. If that was well tolerated, subsequent patients would 
receive rates up to a maximum of 150 mg/min. On Feb 10, 1993. data 
from 14 patients who received Foe at 100 mg/min PE were reviewed by 
Parke-Davis In consultation with a panel of noncompany neurologists. The 
panel unanimously recommended that the rate of Fos administration could 
be Increased to 150 mg/min PE as provided In the protocol. 
Status was defined as 2 or more consecutive seizures without regaining 
consciousness or a single seizure of at leaa~ 10 minutes duration; 
patients with partial 1tatus or absence status were excluded. 
' .. ~ Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 5 years of age or older. 
There ware no restrictions on AED use prior to study entry. Likewise, 
there were no restrictions on concur~ent medication to treat the episode 
of status. 
The protocol required that "if two IV lines are available, study medication 
should be administered through one line and all other medications through 
the other. If only one line is available, it Is important to clear the IV line 
with normal saline between the administration of other medications and 
study drug." 
During administration, vital signs were to be recorded every 5 minutes. 
Continuous ECG recording was to be performed during infusion. If systolic 
blood pressure droppea by 20 mmHg, the investigator could stow the 
infusion r·ate. If the absolute SBP dropped below 70, the investigator was 
to stop the infusion: once the BP returned to an acceptable level, the 
infusion could be restarted at 50% the original rate. 
The goal of the study was to enroll between 20-100 pts between July and 
December 1992. 
B. Subject Dlapoaltlon and Baaellne Comparleon 
54 patients were enrolled at 1 O centers by September 1, 1994. There 
were 32 males and 22 females, 23 whites and 23 blacks. The mean age 
was 39 years of age with a range of 15 years to 75 years. 
26°/o of patients h~d status precipitated by AED withdrawal or 
noncompliance (I.e. had the potential to have low, but measurable levels of 
phenytoin already present prior to IV loading). The sponsor notes that 
only 43 pts had usable plasma drug-concentration data; of these, 16 had 
measurable phenytoln concentrations prior to Fos infusion. The mean level 
for these pts was 6 with a range from 0.12 up to 15. 
Six pts (11°/o) had partial status or absence status in violation of the 
protocol. The other patients all had generalized status, either primary 
generalized or secondarily generalized. 
In 42/54 (78°/o) of pts, benzodlazeplnes were given prior to administration 
of Fos. 35 patients received loading doses at rates of 100 mg/min. (Recall that 
150 mg/min is the rate considered bioequivalent to standard Dilantin 
loading doses). 18 pts received loading doses at rates > 150 mg/min. 
All but 4 pts received total loading doses of 1 O mg/kg or greater. 
c. Results 
Unfortunately, safety data Is presented for the entire group of 
54 patients; It would be helpful to see a review of adverse 
events only for the 12 patients who were dosed as per the 
proposed labeling. On page 36 of the study report, the sponsor presents 
a brief review entitled 11Adverse Events by Rate of Administration." Here 
the sponsor states that the 5 most frequent AEs appeared to occur at 
similar frequencies for pts at faster rates (41 o/o) compared with slower 
rates (45°/o). In this section, the sponsor does not address the fact that 
the post hoc separation of pts into high rate/low rate groups does not 
control for baseline levels of AEDs, especially phenytoin. 
No patients withdrew for AEs. 3 patients died after completing the study 
but all were considered unrelated to Fos. The 8 most frequent adverse 
events were nystagmus, ataxia, headache, agitation, dysarthria, 
somnolence, vomiting, and pruritus. 
Of note in safety data accrued after the cutoff date for this report is the 
occurrence of two cases of P'JStictal psychosis, both beginning 3 days 
after status was treated with Fos. One patient had a previous, less severe 
case of psychosis after status; the other patient had not experienced 
previous post-lctal psychosis. A sensation of itchiness followed the 
psychosis in one patients. 
60°/o of patients had a > 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure; only 4°/o 
had a symptomatic drop in SBP. The sponsor states that, "While the 
magnitude of decreases in blood pressure were substantial in some 
patients, no changes in infusion rate or interventions (eg, Trendelenburg 
positioning, :v fluids, or medications) were required to treat any 
hypotensive symptoms." Status continued beyond 30 minutes post infusion of Fo& in only 3 
patients. 2 of these had other explanations besides lack of efficacy i.e. 
subdural and anoxic brain insult post CPR. Patient 8, Center 9 had a 
gradual decline In seizures over 45 minutes. The Infusion rate 
for this patient was 90 mg/min PE; no plasma levels are 
available for this patient during the first 20 minutes of 
treatment raising the question whether a faster Infusion rate 
would have been more effective.

A. Study Design 
This was a double-blind, parallel-group, active control trial in patients 
requiring a loading dose of phenytoin to prevent or control seizures. Pts 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1 :3 ratio 
to receive either parenteral Dilantin or Fosphenytoin. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 12 years of age or older 
and require a loading dose of phenytoin. Pts whose condition was serious 
or life-threatening were not considered appropriate candidates for the 
study. In particular, patients in status epilepticus were excluded. 
Neurosurgery patients who required acute treatment were also excluded. 
The inclusion criteria required that patients be able to evaluate the extent 
of pain, burning and itching experienced as a result of the infusion. 
The anticipated enrollment was 60 patients, 20 from each of 3 centers. 
During the infusion, vital signs were to be recorded every 5 minutes and 
ECG was to be monitored continuously. After the infusion, vital signs 
were to be recorded every 15 minutes for 2 hours. 
The rate of infusion was not to exceed 50 mg/min PE. By protocol, the 
investigator was to consider slowing the rate if SBP dropped by 20 mmHg 
or greater. If SBP dropped to an absolute of 70mmHg. the lr1fusion was to 
be stopped; once SBP was acceptable, the infusion could be restarted at 
half the previous rate. By protocol amendment, the maximum rate was increased to 1 OOmg/min 
PE for Fos patients. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
39 pts received IV Fos while 13 pts received IV Dilantin. 
The majority of pts required a loading dose because of new onset seizures 
or because their baseline phenytoin levels had dropped below the 
therapeutic range .qLie to noncompliance or prescribed dosage change. 
Fas was given as a total dose between 480n1500 mg/kg PE at infusion 
rates between 40·103 mg/min PE. Dilantin was given as a total dose 
between 290-1000 mg/kg at infusion rates between 20-51 mg/min. 
Because of the design of the study, a true comparison between randomized 
groups cannot be made. In addition to the variable of interest, Dilantin vs 
Fos, there were 4 additional variables that were not adequately 
controlled, to include: 
1. total dose in PE 
2. infusion rate (recall that the bioequivalent infusion rate for Fos 
is 3 X faster in PE than the rate for Dllantin) 
3. presence or absence of measurable baseline levels of phenytoin 
4. when present, the actual values for baseline phenytoin levels 
10/13 Dilantin pts (77°/o) received 800-1000 mg PE while 23/39 Fos pts 
(50°/o) received 800-1000 mg PE or greater. The rate was about 50 
mg/min PE for Dilantin, but only 18/39 (50°/o) of Fos pts received 100 
mg/min or greater (100-150 mg/min is the bioequivalent rate when based 
on free phenytoin levels). 
Therefore, at this point, the question would be, of the 23 pts who received 
800 mg PE or greater, what percent of these received a rate of 100 
mg/min or greater. One might guess that only 10· 12 Fos pts are available 
to compare to the 10-12 Dilantin pts (certainly not randomized groups at 
this point); we have not even introduced the additional variable of 
background phenytoin levels at baseline. 
To further complicate all this, we are told that 7/39 Fos pts (18°/o) required changes in rate compared with 6/13 Dilantin pts (46°/o). The 
reason for the rate changes are as follows: 
Fos 
Hypotension 2 
Generalized burning or Itching 4 
Infusion pump problem 1 
Dilantin 
Hypotension 1 
Localized pain or burning at inj. site 5 
C. Results 
There were no deaths in either treatment group. Three withdrawals 
occurred, all in the Dilantin group. There was 1 withdrawal for AE; there 
were 2 withdrawals for "lost-to·f/u." No AEs in either treatment group 
were rated "serious." 
Because of the multiple variables discussed above, any comparison 
between groups with regard to A Es is really inappropriate. Su ff ice it to 
say that the pattern of AEs seen in the Fos group raised only one unusual 
concern, the occurrence of pruritus in 30°/o of Fos pts vs 0°/o of Dilantin pts. 
Looking only at Fos pts who received a total of 1000 mg PE at rates of 100 
mg/min PE or greater, I identified 15 Fos pts in the category. Of these 
"high-dose, high-rate" pts, 3/15 or 1/5 had a rate change during the 
infusion because of an AE. One pt had hypotension, 1 had itching, and 1 had 
burning. 
D. Cllnlcal Laba 
No clinically important differences are noted between groups and no clear 
trends toward abnormal values are evident. 
E. Vital Signs 
. 
The sponsor's discussion of vital signs seems flawed since they have 
chosen tr r:ompare baseline to the 2-hour visit. (See Sponsor's Tables 20 
111 and 21.) In fact, the vitals of interest are those at 5, 15, and perhaps 30 
minutes. 
Sponsor's Table 22 shows the incidence of decreases in systolic BP > 20 
mm Hg: 7 Fos pts (18°/o) and 4 Dilantin pts (31 °lo). However, the 
percentages are misleading because the true denominators for comparison 
are obscured by variable rates, total doses, and baseline phenytoln levels. 
2 pts on Fos and 1 on Dilantin required rate changes due to hypotension. 
One of these Fos pts had a 26mmHg drop in SBP without symptoms. The 
other Fos pt had an 18mmHg drop with severe dizzlness and moderate 
varUgo. The Dllantin pt had a 22mmHg drop with mild vertigo. 
F. Infusion Sites 
At the follow-up exam, investigators classified the overall appearance of 
the infusion sites. The majority of pts in both treatment gr1Jups tolerated 
the infusions, with no differences between groups noted. 
Immediately after the infusion, 50% of Dilantin pts reported some pain 
and 83°/o reported some burning. By comparison, 2.6°/o of Fos pts reported 
some pain and 10°/o reported some burning. Except for 2 Fos pts who 
reporter "ain 2 hours after the infusion, both pain and burning had 
resolved tor all pts in each treatment group by the end of double-blind 
treatment. 
Investigators rated erythema, swelling, tenderness, necrosis, and bruising 
on a 4 point scale. Essentially no differences between treatment groups 
emerged. 
F. Conclualona 
Because thG 2 drugs were mixed and administered the same way during 
this trial, nothing was learned about relative ease-of-use. 
Rates were faster for Fos on average, but the sponsor' a discussion avoids 
the issue that where rate is important, Fas must be given faster than it 
was in this study and may, under those conditions of use, be associated with more AEs (both local and systemic) than were seen here. Rate is not 
important for maintenance loading and, in that clinical situation, the 
ability to administer a drug faster may not necessarily be an advantage. 
This study provides some safety information in support of a subacute IV 
loading dose of Fos in non .. emergent situations where the physician 
wishes to achieve therapeutic levels of phenytoin more rapidly than could 
be achieved by the oral route. Any comparison between the Fos loading and 
Dilantin loading was obscured by the study design as discussed above. TABLB 15. Most Frequent Adverse Bvents With IV Administration to

The study was intended to be a safety study. The projected enrollment 
was 60 patients. 
Patients were to require a loading dose of phenytoin for the treatment or 
prophylaxis of seizures. Open-label treatment was to consist of a single 
loading dose, minimum 1 O mg/kg PE. This was followed by a 3-hour 
observation period. Patients were to return in 2-7 days for follow-up 
exams and procedures. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria dictated that patients be 12 years of age or 
older. Pts were not to be in serious or life-threatening condition. This 
excluded patients in status epilepticus from the study. 
Not excluded were pts already being treated with phenytoin. Prior 
phenytoin usage was to be assessed when determining dosing 
requirements. If that information was unavailable, the Investigator was 
to use clinical judgment to decide on a dose. 
The dosing administration could be divided and given in separate locations 
on the buttock. B. Subject Disposition and Baaallne Comparlaon 
The study was conducted between August 1992 and February 1993. 
60 patients (34 male, 26 female) entered the study. 57 completed all the 
follow-up assessments. 32 pta were white; 24 were black; 1 was Asian. 
The mean age was 43 years with a range 16·80 years. 
The reasons for loading dose were as follows: 
Noncompliance 1 1 
First treatment with phenytoin .1 8 
Decreased phenytoin level (unknown reason) 1 3 
Decreased phenytoin level (prescribed dose reduction) 9 
Other reason 9 
Therefore, IM loading in the face of absent plasma phenytoin occurred in 
about 27 patients. The other 33 patients had the potential to have low but 
measurable levels of phenytoin and might therefore have received 
downward adjusted doses (based on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator). AEDs taken within 3 days of study entry included phenytoin 
in 27 patients. Only 23 patients took no AEDs within 3 days of study 
entry. 
A review of concurrent AEDs taken from day of Fos loading to follow-up 
follows: 
None , 0 
Phenytoin 47 
Carbamazepine 10 
VPA 1 0 
Loratepam 5 
Phenobarbital 2 
Clorazepate 2 
Methsuximide 1 
Acetazolamide 1 
This list reminds us that the follow .. up assessments done after the day of 
Fos dosing will be obscured by the use of these other drugs and, in fact, 
might be more representative of these AEDs than the Fos itself. 
The doses of Fos ranged from 350 to 1500mg (3.6 to 20.2 mg/kg) PE. 22 
' , ,. patients received a loading dose of 12 mg/kg or greater. An additional 25 
pts received a loading dose between 10-12 mg/kg. The actual doses were 
between a gram and 1600 mg for 16 pts: 20 pt& received between 800 to 
1000 mg. Note that the 12 pts who received tees than 1 O mg/kg of Fos 
were actually in violation of the protocol requirement that pta receive at 
least 10 mg/kg. 
Doses were given as a single injection for 28 pts. 28 pts had their doaes 
divided into 2 injections. 4 pts received 3-4 injections. 
C. Reeulta 
No patient died during the study. Withdrawals in the true sense of the 
word could r!ot occur since the Fos was given as a loading dose. 
Only one patient experienced serious AEs: arrhythmia, nauropathy, stupor, 
and tachycardia. This was also the only pt who experienced AEs that were 
graded severe in intensity. He was a 74 year old man with a history of a 
stroke with complex partial seizures. He received IM Fos on Day 1 . On Day 
4, he experienced an irregular pulse, deterioration in neurological status, 
stuporous condition, and tachycardia. None of these were considerttd 
related to study medication by the Investigator. The pt had not yet 
recovered from these AEs by the end of the study. 
66°/o of pts experienced some AEs. Most of these were considered 
associated with use of Fos. Almost alt these AEs were considered mild in 
intensity. 
Nystagmus was the most common AE, occurring in 470/o of pts. Dizziness 
and ataxia occurred in 17°/o and 13o/o of pts respectively. 
Evaluation of injection sites revealed that only 3 pts had mild injection 
site irritation 3 hours after IM dosing. 4 pts had mild irritation 2· 7 days 
later at the follow-up visit. Only 1 pt had mild irritation at both time 
points. The sponsor states that no relationship was found between the 
dose or the number of injections and the tendency toward this mild 
irritation. D. Conclualona 
This study demonstrated no drug-related serious AEs, either systemically 
or locally at the injection site~ when Fos was given IM Rt relatively high 
doses. 47 pts received 10 mg/kg or greater. However, only 28 pts 
received the entire loading dose at a single injection site and some of 
these may have received leas than 10 mg/kg. Because of this last point, 
this study would probably bsat support the safety of IM Fos at comparable 
doses with the total dose divided and given at two separate Injection 
sltiilS. 
Note that patients who required an emergent loading dose of phenytotn 
were excluded from this study. In particular, pts with status were 
excluded. Thus, this study would not support the efficacy of IM Fos in 
emergent situations. Likewise, there is no data that I am aw1re of to 
support use of IM Fos loading over PO Fos loading. In fact, IM Foa loading 
would probably only have a role in non-emergent settings where patients 
could not tolerate PO feedings. Thia nlight occur In patients chronically 
treated with AEDs (especially phenytoln) who develop transient 
gastrointestinal Illnesses that preclude continued oral medication and 
result in dropping plasma AED levels. 
At a minimum, although this study was designed to support the safety of 
IM loading, the data from this study can be used to support the safety of 
IM maintenance dosing. That is, if the higher doses given in this study 
were tolerated, the lower doses necessary for IM maintenance dosing 
should have a wider safety margin.

Anttconvulsant; prodrug for phenytoin. 
S Uflllll r.l: 
It was pointed out fn our team meeting for thfs new drug that the t~ vivo 
hydrol~sfs o ·9653 occurs tn 2 steps. producing one mo1e of formaidenyde 
for each mole of prodrug. In the fnftfal clinical Phase I trial. the top dose 
of 2250 mg would produce 5.5 nrnoles of HCHO. The possible hazard from thf s 
burden will be discus,ed from several different vetwrotnts below. All 
calculations are gross approximations, based on available information. 
1. OSHA has adopted a pdrmfssible exposure leve1 for toxic effects of 
formaldehyde other than cancer of 3 ppm as an 8 hour time weighted 
average, anu 10 ppm maximum peak concentration for 30 minutes in an 8 
hour period (Third Annual Report on Carcfnogens. USDHHS Public Health 
Service. September, 19831 page 73). It ha' been repgrted that workers 
exposed to formaldehyde at i concentration of 7 mg/nr' developed blood 
levels of 0.6 -4.0 mg.11. The duration of exposure was not given 
(J.Piotrowski. Exposure Tests for Organic Compaounds tn Industrial 
Toxicology, Gant Printfn~ Office. DC. 19771 p.122). (lm33• 1000 1; wt. 
of air• 1.2~3 gms/1 at ooc + 760 mm Hg; therefore 7 mg/m • 7 
nig/l .~~3 kg • 5.4 mg(kg • 5.4 ppm 1r1 alrj 
Since 5.4 ppm of HCHO·~ a maximum of 4 mg/1 1n blood, the 10 ppm maximum 
al lowed by OSHA would 7 approximate iy 7 .4 mg HCH0/11ter or o.zs meg 
HCH0/1 fn blood. This figure should more or less repre,ent ~he maximal 
allowable blood level of HCHO accordfnJ to OSHA •. If we then assume that the 5.5 11111<>les of RtRO that are sp11t rom the prodrug all appear in the 
circulation (ave. volume 5 ltters) the concentration would be 33 mg/l or 
1.1 me /1 or a roximatel 4 fold hf her than the OSHA level allowed. 
owevar, s s • very-cru e es ma e s nee e a a are not rea y 
available for taking the time factor allowed under the OSHA limit into constderatton. 
2. There fs 1 great deal of 1nform1tfon fn the literature that ~uggest' that it fs formic ae1d that is repsonsible for the ocular toxicity and 
ac1do'f' seen fol•owing acute methanol pu~'onfng (methanol~ 
formaldehyde~ formate). This toxicfty would be of greater concern when 
dealing with a drug to be u~ed acutely than would potential 
carcfnogenfcity. Although a role for HCHO has not been clearly ruled 
out, experfme~ts in monkey1 1uggest that the resultant formate levels are 
of 1110re concern.

In a model fn rhesus monkeys for methanol ocular toxfcfty and metabolic 
acidosis, formate blood and CSF levels of 7 to 34 meg/1 were assocfated 
wtth optic disc edema, morphologf~al alterations in optic nerve and 
swelling of oli~odendroglfal cytoplasm (M1rtfn -Amat. Hayreh. Baumtach 
et al, Arch Ophthalmol •• YS. 1847-50, 1851·58, 1859-61; Hartin-Amat, 
e~.11., TAP. 45, 201-2oa:-tY78). Pretreat.,nt wft.h folate fncr1ased the 
metabolism of l'Ormate and decreased the toxfcfty (McMartin et al, JPET, 
201. 564-5721 1S77). In the propo~:d clfnfcal trfal, ff we a~sume the 
!:'S" meq of HCHO goes to 5.5 meq of formate, wfth 1 blood concentration of 
1.1 meq/1, there ts a minimum of a 7•fold safet* factor before ocular 
toxicity occurred fn the monkey (wh•cn 1s thoug t to metabolize HCHO like 
the human). 
It has been reported that the mechanism for ocular toxfcfty caused by 
methanol fs the fnhfbftion of cytochrome oxfdase by formate (Nicholls. 
BBRC, 67, 610-616, 1975). Since cytochrome oxfdase actfvfty fs low fn 
white iitter, ft has been suggestea that tts actfvfty may be critical fn 
that tissue. The Ki values ·determined for formate tnhtbftton of 
c,rtachrome oxidase are 6etween 5 ana 3o m R'2(above reference pfus 
RarEin-Ariiit, Arch Ophthot., 95, 1847-50, ·1977). Based on this data, 
blood levels of formate of r:; m M would be somewhat lo~er then those 
e~ected to produce toxicit~. 
In dogs and cats administered 35 mg/kg (1.2 meq/kg) of formaldehyde by 
i.v. infusion, a blood HCHO concentration of 25 mg/1 (0.83 meq/1) was 
produced whfch declf"ed to about 1 mg/1 by 1 hour after the infusion. '4 
x as much HCHO was fn erythrocytes as fn plasma). The p,,~ plasma · concentration of formate, however, was 144 mg/l (3. 1 meq at the end of 
the fnfusiun, which declined with a Tl/2 of 1.5 hours. Toxicity was 
not addressed (G. Malorne; et al. Naunyn -Schmfedebergs A.E.P.P., 250, 
419-436, 1965). These data would suggest that peak levels of the --­
p~ssibl~ more tox1c metabolite, formate, might be aeerox~mated as follows 
for top dose fn the clinical trial: 
5.5 meq of HCHO (155 mg) = 3 '!?~/kg fn a 50 kg person. If 35 mg/kg 
of t.v. HCHO ~144 mg/l of formate, 3 mg/kg or HCHO may result in 
eeak blood levels of formate of 12 mg or 0.26 meg/1. (This is 
assuming comparable relative 61ood 1ev1es to body weight in humans 
and animals. Actually. dogs may have slightly larger blood 
volume/kg of body weight than humans, so the est1mate for hum~ns ;~ 
possibly on the low side. The assumption for comparable metaboli~m 
ts also made). 
This ftgur-.1s considerably lower than the Ki for formate inhibftion of 
cytochrome oxfdase and it is about 25-30 fold lower than the lowe~t 
leve,s of formate a'soc1ated with ocular toxicity tn monkey~ (see numbers 
2 ano 3 above). If instead, we examine the blood HCHO concentration 
using these data. an 1.v. dc~e of prodrug that yteld~ 5.5 mmoles of HCHO 
(0.11 mmoles/kg) would be expected to result in a peak blood 
co~centratfon of HCHO of 0.08 mmo1es/1iter, or 1/3 of the max;mal allowable HCHO exposure according to OSRA. 
Evaluation and Reconnendations: 
The above approx1mat1ons are ~xtremely crude, but thvy do provide some data 
for evaluating the risk involved from a drug which wf 11 be used acutely that is metabolized to pr~duce a mole of formalaeh1de for every mole of drug. • ... ,.,, lftU 
Based on OSHA limits for exposure to formaldehyde, the guestimate is that the 
top dose of prodrug planned f" the rising dose trial (2250 mg) would resu1t in 
anywhere from 1/3 of'it>Ytfmes the maximal allowable blood level of 
formalaehyde. If we· assu~ that formate is responsible for the expected acute 
toxfcty (occular and acidosis), there may be anywhere between a 7 f~ld and a 
30 fold safety factor, based on toxicity observed 1n monkey1 and blood levels 
of formate measured after 1.v. administration ~f HCHO to dogs. If we believe 
that formate toxtctty occurs through cytochrome oxfdase fnhfbition, there is 
at least a small margin of safety based on the Kf. 
In any case, ft is a close r.111, and there are a couple of precautions that 
might be considered. Monitoring of blood formic acid, blood pH, bicarbonate 
a~d pCO, is reconmended. Since foltntc acid pretreatment hastens the 
elimination rate. a supplement of 2 mg. p.o., might be given the day before 
the trial. However. tf it ts considered that this ts an approprfate time to 
determine whether or not formate levels in blood are detectable (sfnce fn 
practice there would not be ttme to give folin.1.c acid) I would reconnend 
careful monitoring for formate levels at a l1 ·doses before proceeding to the 
next higher dose. SRD fs May 4. so sponsor should be phoned.

I. PHARMACODYNAMICS 
Anticonvu/sant Activity 
A) EFl~ECTS ON MES-INDUCED SEIZURES IN MICE (RR 740-02904, NOA Vol. 1.9). 
1. After Iv dosing with phenytoln (8 mg/kg) or fosphenytoln (11.9 mg/kg), no appreciable 
enttconwlsant actMty wu seen for either drug untll 10 min, when 50% (418) of phenytoin­
treated mice were protected from tonic hlndllmb extension (THE) end 13% (1/8) of 
fosphenytoln-tntated mice were protected (Tab,e 1.1). 
2. Peak activity was reached for both compounds at 30 min when 63% (5/8) of phenytoln­
treated and 88% of fosp~enytoln .. treated mice were protected (T1ble 1.1). In addition to 
reducing the Incidence of MEs-lnduced THE, phenytoin •nd fosphenytoln reduced seizure 
duration. 
3. When dose-response determlnatkma were made at 10 and 30 min (Table 1.2), both drugs 
exerted dose-dependent protection from MES-induced THE. The iv ED50 values (95% 
confidence llmita)were8.3 mg/kg (8.1-11.2) at 10 min and 8.6 mg/kg (5.1-8.0) at 30 ~In after 
dosing with phenytoin, compared to 10.8 mg/kg (8.-t.17.5) et 10 min and 6.8 mg/kg (6.1 .. 7.5) 
at 30 min after dosing with fosphenytain (dose' expressed aa phenytoln equivalents). Neither 
vehicle was active. Based on statistical comp1ri1on1 of the dose-responae curves and 
potency ratios, the anticonvulsant potencies of foaphenytoln and phen)'toln against MES­
induced THE were not lignlflcantty different at either time poln~ although there were apparent 
differences In low dose activity and onset of action. 
4. The EOSO values for Iv phenytoln and fosphenytoln were In agreement with those reported 
in the literature for oral (9.0 and 12.8 mg/kg), ac (7.2 mg/kg), and Ip (9.5 mg/kg) 
administration of phenytoln to mice and for oral (11.8 mg/kg PE) and Ip (10.3 mg/kg PE) 
administration of the prodrug to mice.

Cardiovascular effects 
A) ANTIARRHYTHMIC ACTIVITY IN VITRO AND IN VIVO (RR 740-02905, Vol. 9). 
In vitro, fosphenytoin had not antiantlythmic effect in acetytatrophanthklln-treated guinea pig right atrta 
at concentrations up to 400 uM, whlle phenytoln restored rhythmic beating In 4 of 7 atria at a mean 
EC50 of 20 uM. In vivo, fosphenytoln and phenytoin exerted similar antlarrhythmtc actMty, 
respectively converting oubafn.induced tachycardia In 87 and 100 % of animala after an lnfuak>n time 
of 8.5 and 7 min, at administered doaet of 24.3 and 14.1 mg/kg, and plume levels of 18 and 29.5 
ug/ml of phenytoin. This indicates that fosphenytotn has no direct antlarrhythmlc action, but II almllar 
to phenytoln under in vivo conditions, presumably due to enzymatic conversion to phenytoin. 
B) HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS IN ANESTHETIZED DOGS (RR 740-029oe. Vol. 9). 
1. Fosphenytoin (60 mglkg) lnfuled over 2 min (infusion rate of 20 mg/kg/min) produced marked 
reductions in systolic (50%) and di31tolic (60%) blood preuure, heart rate (25"), and 
LvdP/dt (70%). The ma>cimUm effect& were observed 1 O min •fter termln•tlon of Infusion and 
had returned toward normal by 60 min. f'l.ar rapid Infusion of an equlmolar dose of phenytoln 
(40 mg/kg), changes In CV parameters were comparable to thoH lffn af'terfoaphenytoln 
(Figure• 1.1 a 1.2). Effects on CV parameters appeared somewhat more pronounced after 
fosphenytoln (dla1tollc BP was algnlficantly lower In fosphenytoln group at 4 min); however, 
3 of the phenytoln animals died within 4 min from onset of intuaion, while 111 e foaphenytoln 
dogs recovered. 
2. Plasma levels of fosphenytoin were highest at the end of the Infusion, while puk levels of 
formed phenytoin were seen at about 8 min after the end of Infusion (FlguN 1.3). Peak 
plasma phenytokl levels (free levell not delllrmined) were reached more rapidly after lnf&Jllon 
of phenytoin than after foaphenytoln, although maximal levels achieved Mf'9 llmilar. 
3. Foaphenytoln (31 mg/kg) Infused over 15, 20, or 30 min produced algnlflc8nt reductions In 
syatolie (25%) and diastolic (35%) bkx>d preuure, HR (10%), left ventricular oontractlllty -0

(LvdP/dt, 20-45%), and cardiac output (20-40%) at all three infusion rates (Figures 1.4 and 
1.5). The maximum effects were comparable at each intuaion rate and the maximum effects 
were observed at the end of each Infusion period. In each group, pressures had returned to 
normaJ by eo mJn. There were no significant effects on systolic blood pressure, heart rate, left 
ventrtcular end diastolic pressure, or cardiac output Comparable changes In CV parameters 
were aeen when an equimolar dose of phenytoin (21 mg/kg) was infused over 30 min. 
4. Analysis of plasma samples showed that maximum levels of fosphenytoin occurred at the 
end of the infusion period (Figure I.I). Peak fosphenytoin levels of 106, 82, and, 72 ug/ml 
were attained after Infusion over 15, 20, and 30 min, reapac:tlvely. The maximum levels of 
phenytDin wera also obaerYed at the end of the infuaiOn period. Peak levels of phenytoln were 
35, 29, and 31 ug/ml after infusion of fosphenytoln over 15, 20, and 30 min, respectively. 
Plasma levels declined rapidly thereafter. After Infusion of phenytoin, plasma levels of 
phenytoin were maximal (33 uglml) at the end of Infusion, and declined thereafter .

Single-dose absorption end pharmacokineties 
A) BLOOD LEVELS AFTER IM ADMINISTRATION TO RATS (RR 764-01612, Vol. 1.10). 
GroupsOf 4 male rats (CD-Sprague-Oa\1ey) were given 115, 250, 370, or 500 mgJkg of fosphanytoln 
or 77, 169, 250, or 337 mg/kg of phenytoin (equlmolar dOHI) by Im injection. Blood sempl•a were 
collected from each rat 1t 0.6, 1.5. 3, 6, and 24 hr post-dose. Analysis wa1 by HPLC. 
Peak -::ood concentratior11 of foaphenytoin were achieved at 30 min after im 1dmlnl1trat1on and 
averaged 9.6, 12.5. 21.4, and 19.8 ug/ml after doses of 115, 250, 370, and 500 mg/kg, respectively. 
Blood levels of foaphenytoln were still quanttftable at 6 hr in the 3 highest dose groups. Blood 
concentrations of phenytDin lftar Im folphenyto!n peaked at Nl min and averaged 42.3, 112, 127, and 
153 ug/ml at the reapective doaea. Correapondlrig peak levels after ph1nytoin admlni1tr1t1on were 
14.9, 20.1, 31.2, Qnd 33.2 ug/ml at 30 min after dosing. Thus, fosphenytoin administration resulted 
in phenytoin levels s.ex higher than those produced by an equlmolar doae of phenytoln, lndicllttng 
greater bioavailablUty of phenytoin after Im administration of foaphenytotn. 
B) PHENYTOIN PHARMACOKINETICS AND BIOAVAILASILITY AFTER IV ADMINISTRATION OF 
EQUIMOLAR DOSES OF PHENYTOIN OR FOSPHENYTOIN TO DOGS (RR 784-01808, Vol. 10). 
Five dogs were administered equimolar tv dOMI of phenytoin (10 mg/kg) or foaphenytoln (14.8 m9'1<g) 
in a two-way cro1aover 1tudy designed to compare the ph1rm1cokin1tice and bloavallablHty of 
phenytoin after each drug (Table 11.1). Analysis wa1 by HPLC. 
After iv administration of folphenytoln, fosphenytoin t1/2, Vd, and AUC value1 averagld 2.6 min, 150 
ml/kg, and 255 ug min/ml, '8Specttvely. The Cl of 40.2 mUmln/kg approximate• th• hepatic blOOd flow 
in dogs, which would be consistent with metabolism to phenytoin by phoaphltaMI preHnt In ti11ue1 
such aa kidney and liver. Converaton of foaphenytoin to phenytoln was rapid tn dog1; the formation 
t1/2 averaged 0.42 min and the peak phenytotn levels (mean 6.98 uglml) we,.. reached at 3.3 min . 
During the first 30 min after administration of phenytotn. phenytom levetl were higher than after 
administration of foapher1ytoin, but levels were 1imilar there1ftlr. The elimination t1/2, Cl, Vd, and 
AUC of phenytoin ware not lignlftcantly different after Iv admlnl1tr1tion of fosphenytotn and phenytoln 
sodium. The bloav-.llablltty of phenytoln after Iv foaphenytoln administration averaged 97.7%.

C) PHENYTOIN PHARMACOKINETICS ANO RELATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY AFTER IM 
ADMINISTRATION OF PHENYTOIN OR FOSPHENYTOIN TO DOGS (RR 764-01801, Vol. 1.10). 
Five dogs were administered equlmolar Im do1e1 of phenytoln (10 mg/kg) or fo1phenytoln (14.8 
mg/kg) in a two-way aouover study to compare the pharmmcokinetica and bloavailablllty of phenytoln 
after each (T1bl1111.2and11.3). Samples were analyzed by HPLC. 
After im administration, fosphenytoln levels reached a mean peak of 20.4 ug/ml at 9 min, then rapidly 
decreased such that foaphanytoln was not detectable In plasma after 120 min (T1ble 11.3). The 
absorption and elimination t1/2 values averaged 3.2 and 17.4 min, respectively. The appearance of 
phenytoln In the plasma was fairly rapid after im administration of foaphenytoin. The formation t112, 
Cmax, and tmax were 24.7 min, 6.8 ug/rnl, and 76.9 min, re1pective~f (Tabl• 11.2). The corre1pondlng 
values after Im adminiltration of an equlmolar do1e of phenytoln were 17.4 min, 2.18 ug/ml, and 68.1 
min for the absorption t1/2, emu, and tmax, rupecttvety. The tllmtnation t1/2 and apparent volume 
of distribution of phenytoln after foaphenytotn ldmlnl1trltion 1vermged 164 min and 1058 ml/kg, 
iotspectivefy, which were significantly different than corresponding valuea of 389 min and 4086 mVkg, 
respectively, obtatned after im phenyloin. The dttfer9nat1 probably reftect precipitation and deposition 
of phenytoln at the injection alte. 
The AUC values obtained after adminl1trltion of phenytoln were 1ub1tlntialty lower when compared 
to the phenytoln AUCa attar fosphen)'toln administration. From O to 720 min. the AUC values 
averaged 2091 and 980 ug.mlnlml after fo1ph1nytoln and phenytoln locllum, re1pecttvely. When 
extrapolated to infinity, the corresponding AUC values averaged 2238 and 1336 ug.minlml, 
respectively. These flnding1 ahow that the bioavallabutty of phenytoin ldmlnlltem 11 foaphenytoln 
was Increased compared to Im phenytoin sodium, and that th• relative bioavallabllity wa1 time

Anatysis of 48-hr urine samples collected after administration of phenytoin or fosphenytoin indicated 
similar metabolite elimination profiles. Approximately 58% or the dose was recovered In 48-hr 
cumulative urine after dosir.g with fosphenytoln and about 47.4°4 of the dose was recovered after 
phenytoin. The major metabolite was the glucuronide conjugate or 5-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-5-

Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination 
A) TISSUE DISTRIBUTION IN RATS (RR 764-01600, Vol. 1.10). 
The tissue dlstr1bution of 14C-fosphenytoin was examined In 36 male rats after a single iv bolus dose 
of 1 O mg/kg. The distribution of total radioactivity into various tissues Wiii very rapid. For blood, 
heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen, the highest amount of total radioactivity was seen within the 
first 5 min. The highest levels In brain, carcass, eyes, intestines, skin/hair, stomach, testes, and 
urina1y bladder occurred at 20, 20, 30, 90, 30, 10, 60, and 60 min, respectively. The highest levels 
of radioactivity in the intestines, kidneys, liver, carcass, and skin/hair averaged 52.1, 1.9, 14.5, 32.6, 
and 22.1% of the dose, respectively. Only 0.2% of the dose was found In the brain at 5 and 60 min 
after dosing, and the amount of radioactivity declined rapidly thereafter. 
Rapid elimination of total radioactivity was observed from blood and all tissues. At 24 hr the highest 
radioactivity was in the carcass and intestines (2.1 and 4.7% of the dose, respectively); the 
radioactivity In all other tissues including blood was less than 1 % of the dose. At 48 hr after dosing, 
less than 1.4% of the dose remained in all tissues. The tissue/blood total radioactivity ratio was above 
1 or close to 1 In the heart, Intestines, kidneys, liver, lungs, and stomach over the entire study period. 
The highest tissue/blood ratios were in intestines> stomach> liver> urinary bladder> kidneys> lungs. 
Radio-HPLC analysis of blood, intestines, kidney, and liver samples showed three radioactive peaks, 
which were Identified 11 a mixture of p-HPPH glucuronlde and an unknown metabolite, p-HPPH, and 
phenytoin, based on their retention times after beta-glucuronidase treatment. In brain, the radioactive 
peak conuponding to p-HPPH glucuronide was absent. m-HPPH was not detected in blood or any 
of the 4 tissues examined. The prodrug was rapidly converted to phenytoin. At 5 min after dosing, 
fosphenytoin was not detectable Ir• brain, intestines, kidneys, and liver, and only a trace amount was 
detected in blood. The tllluelblood ratio for phenytoin was above one In liver, kidneys, and intestines, 
and was close to one in brain at several of the later time points after administration. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined after the concentration-time profiles of phenytoln in blood, brain, 
intestines, kidneys •nd liver had been fitted to appropriate pharmacoklnetlc models. The elimination 
half-lives of phenytoin In blood, brain. intestines, kidneys, and liver were determined to be 72.8, 59.8, 
52.6, 90.1, and 70.3 min, respectively. The elimination t1/2 for blood agrees very closely with 
published data (Varla and Stella). 
13 ... 
B) MASS BALANCE AFTER IV ADMINISTRATION TO RATS (RR 764-01608, Vol. 1.10). 
The metabolism and excretion of 14C-fosphenytoin were studied in 10 male rats following iv 
administration of 10 mg/kg. At 24 hr after dosing, 86.9% of the dose was recovered, with 46.7% in 
urine and 40.2% in feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of radioactivity over 72 hr averaged 
51. 7% and 4 7. 7% of the dose, respectively. These results are consistent with what has been reported 
for DPH. In the 24 hr urine sample, a large fraction of the radioactivity was In the form of polar 
metabolites. In contras~ 24-hr fecal samples contained more non·polar metabolites. In the 24-48 and 
48-72 hr urine and fecal samples, a larger percentage of the dose was eliminated as nonpolar 
metabolites. When separated by HPLC, the polar fraction was found not to contain any unchanged 
tosphenytoin. Three radioactive peaks were detected in this fraction; the major urinary metabolita was 
a glucuronide conjugate of p-HPPH. Two additional peaks were not identified. One major and two 
minor metabolites were detected in the nonpolar fraction of urine. The major metabolito was identified 
as p-HPPH, and one of the minor metabolites was phenytoin. One nonpolar metabolite remained 
unidentified. The nonpolar fraction of fece~ contained the same unknown minor metabolite detected 
in urine and a major matabolite identified to be p-HPPH. So, fosphenytoin was cleared entirely by 
metabolism; only a trace amount of phenytoin was recovered in urine;> 40% of the dose was 
recovered in urine and faces as tt ,lucuronide conjugate of p-HPPH. Metabolism appears Identical 
to that of phenytoin, ie, ring oxidation and glucuronidation, followed by renal and biliary excretion of 
the metabolites. 
C) IN VITRO HYDROLYSIS IN HUMAN, DOG, AND RAT BLOOD AND TISSUES (RR 764-01597, Vol. 
1.11 ). 
In vitro conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin was examined in rat, dog, and human tissues and 
\\ tlole blood. Incubation of fosphenytr 1in with whole blood and various tissues from rats resulted In the 
rapid disappearance of prodrug wi'•n a concomitant appearance of equimolar amounts of phenytoin. 
Kidneys, small intestines,£ 1liver1!xhibited the highest phosphatase activity. Dog and human blood 
hydrolyZed the drug m11· · · 'slaMy. Mean in vitro half-lives of fosphenytoin In rat, dog, and human 
whole blood wertt 5.89, • ~9 minutes, respectively. Faster prodrug conversion was observed 
in dog tissue homogen'" 1 the small Intestine, kidney, and liver again the most active in 
mediating hydrolysis of the P• ~. In imro studies with partially purified alkaline phosphatase (bovine 
liver and dog intestines) and acid phosphatase (bovine) revealed that fosphenytoin was a better 
substrate for alkaline than for acid phosphatase. 
D) PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING OF FOSPHENYTOIN (RR 764-01620, Vol. 1.11). 
The protein binding of 14C-fosphenytoin to dog and human plasma was determined by the 
ultrafiltration method. Mean percentages of fosphenytoin (at a concentration of 20 ug/ml) bound to 
human and dog plasma proteins were 95.7 and 91.3%, respectively, indicating that the drug is highly 
protein bound at therapeutic concentrations. Albumin accounted for 88% of the fosphenytoin binding 
to human plasma proteins. Varying the concentrations of albumin from 25 to 50 mg/ml significantly 
increased the% fosphenytoin bound from 81 to 90.5. Binding of 20 ug/ml to human alpha-acid 
glycoprotein (0.2 to 2 mg/ml) was Independent of protein concentration, with percent bound averaging 
13.2%. Binding of fosphenytoin to human albumin, 40 mg/ml, decreased linearly from 81 to 67% when 
concentrations of fosphenytoin increased from 6 to 200 ug/ml. 
The effect of fosphenytoin on the plasma protein binding of phenytoin was studied by coincubating 
DPH at various concentrations of fosphenytoln (7.5-500 ug/ml). Phenytoin binding decreased with 
.ncreasing fosphenytoin concentrations. At a OPH concentration of 5 uglml, the free fraction of 
phenytoin increased from 4 to 18% when the fosphenytoin concentrations increased from 7.5 to 500 
ug/ml. These results indicate that at high concentrations, fosphenytoln may enhance the 
pharmacological or toxicological effects of phenytoln by displacing OPH from Its binding sites. 
14 ... 
Drugs highly bound to albumin, such as phenylburazone, sulfisoxazole, or warfarin, can displace 
fosphenytoin from binding sites on albumin. When toxic concentrations of AEDs such as PHB, OPH, 
or VPA were added to plasma, the drugs significantly increased (5~20%) the free fraction of 
fosphenytoin. Diazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine at a concentration of <10 ug/ml did not 
change the free fraction of fosphenytoin. Since fosphenytoln has little inbinsic pharmacological etfll!ct, 
the changes in free fraction should have no dinical significance. Addition of fosphenytoln at equim..>lar 
concentrations to c:arbamazepine, phenobarbital, or VPA resulted in small but significant displacement 
of these drugs from its plasma binding sites. The degree of displacement of diazepam or 
carbamazepine was not enhanced by increasing the concentration of tosphenytoin 30-80-fold. The 
slight increase in free fraction of these drugs caused by fosphenytoin Is unlikely to have clinical 
significance. 
Toxicokinetics 
A) TOXICOKINETICS IN RATS FOLLOWING SINGLE IM OR IV DOSES (RR 764-02096, Vol. 1.11 ). 
Plasma phenytoin concentrations were determined in serial blood samples collected for 32 hr after 
administration of single im or iv doses of 150 mg/kg fosphenytoln to Wistar rats (5/sex). While peak 
plasma levels were greater after iv adminlstratiOn, concentration-tirne profiles appeared similar 
between routes after Cmax was reached. Phenytotn mean Cmax values following im fosphenytoin 
were 50~0% lower than those after Iv fosphenytoin (Table 11.5). Mean bnax values were 10-15X 
greater after im administration. Elimination t112 averaged 2.4 (im) and 5.3 (Iv) hr In males and (18 (im) 
and 21 (iv) hr in females. Mean AUC values were 331 (im) and 404 (iv) ug hr/ml in males and 649 
(Im) and 611 (iv) in females. Thus, sex differences In phenytoln pharmacoklnetics were seen, peak 
phenytoin levels were reduced after im administration relative to iv administration. and total phenytoln 
exposure was similar following Im or iv administration of the same dose.

Phenytoin kinetics were determined after single Im or Iv doses of 50 mg/kg fosphenytoln to beagle 
dogs (Table 11.8). Serial blood samples were collected tor 32 hr after dosing. Mean Cmax and tmax 
values following im fosphenytoin were approximatety 21% lower (21.3 ug/ml for Im veraua 26.8 for Iv)

and 100% longer (1.2 hr for im versus 0.6 hr for iv) than those following iv fosphenytoin. Once Cmax 
was attained, plasma phenytoin concentration-time profiles were similar for both routes. Mean 
elimination t112 values were essentially the same following im (2.8 hr) and iv (3 hr) administration. 
Mean AUC values following im and iv administration were also comparable, averaging 159 and 163 
ug hr/ml, respectively. There was no gender difference in pharmacokinetics in dogs.

adrninistered a single dose, while non-rodents received rising doses, allowing one or more days for 
rec.overy between doses. Doses were administered either as an iv injection or a 30 min iv infusion. 
The acute toxicity of fosphenytoin was similar to that of equimolar doses of phenytoin when both 
drugs were administered by iv infusion. HO\Yever, when administered by bolus injection phenytoin 
was more potent than fosphenytoin, probably because of the more granual rise in peak phenytoin 
levels with the later compound. Clinical signs were similar for both and included ataxia, prostration, 
convulsions, and hypokinesia in both rodent and non-rodent species. Tremors and dyspnea were 
commonly observed in rodents, while struggling, salivation, and vomiting/retching were seen In dogs. 
When administered to rats by 30 min infusion, both drugs produced rigid htndlimbs, while only 
fosphenytoin produced this finding after rapid iv bolus injection. In general the times of onsat and 
recovery of toxic effects were similar for both compounds except followtng rapid iv injection to rats. 
Under these conditions, toxic effects were observed imn jediately after dosing with phenytoln but only 
after mean lag times of 4 to 14 min with tosphenytoin. Necropsies of rats, rabbits and dogs revealed 
no macroscopic pathology which could be attributed to drug treatment 
Since phenytoin is commonly administered to children, the acute toxicities of fosphenytoln and 
phenytoin were compared in weanling (4 week old) and neonatal (7 days) rats. When administered 
by 30 min iv infusion to weanllngs. the compounds produced aimilar toxic signs, which Included 
ataxia, prostration, hypokinesia, sedation, piloerection, dyspnea, hypopnea, tremors, and convulsions 
(few foaphenytoin rats only). The phenytoin and fosphenytoin MLD's In wesnllng rats were similar to 
those obtained in adult rats. Because iv injections could not be made In neonates, both neonatal and 
weanling rats were administered fosphenytoin or phenytoin ip. It was concluded from this study that 
the acute toxicities of the two drugs were similar following Ip administration, but that both were more 
toxic (lethal) in neonates. 
B) ACUrE IM TOXICITY IN RATS AND DOGS (RR 745-01738, RR 745-01742~ Vol. 1.12) 
The acute t.oxictties of fosphenytcin and phenytoin were also compared after Im admtr.istratlon to rats 
(3/se>e/dose) and dogs (3/sex). Clinical sign• were noted in rata within 40 to 60 min poatdoae with 
both compounds. Ataxia and prostration were observed In rats With fosphenytoln doses 112 and 113 
lower, res~'9fy, on a molar basis. than those phenytaln do1e1 producing the 11J11me algna. Deaths 
occurred between 3 and 19 hr postdOM with fosphenytoin doses ~ 247 mg/kg (phenytoin 
equivalents), while no deaths occurred with phenytoin doses up to 337 mg/kg (Table 111.2). In dogs, 
sedation and emeaia occurred with both compounds, while prostration, ataxia, and convulsion were 
seen only with fosphenytoin. Struggling during dosing, presumably resulting from pain, was seen only 
with phenytotn. No deaths occurred in dogs at doses of up tc 50 mg/kg of either compound. In a 
separate PK study in rats, Whole blood phenytoln concentrations were consistently 5 to 6 times higher 
after adminil1rati0n of foaphenytoln thin with equimolar doses of phenytoln (see PK section, above). 
Thus, the greater solubility and resultant higher blood levels presumably accounted for the increased 
systemic toxicity of foaphenytoln ...,, In both n.ita and dogs. In both speciel, phenytoln caused 
injection site necrosis while no necro1i1 waa oburved With foaphenytoln.

1. Treatment 
Four groups of 18 W11tar rats/sex wero given daily iv (bolus) doses of vehicle or fosphenytoin 
(30, 60, and 150 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. ·ren ratslsex/grp were euthanized at the completion of 
dosing, and 5/sex/group were sacrtticed after a 4 week recovery period (week 8). ThrtM 
rats/sex/ga·oup were sacrificed 15 min postdose during week 3 for determination of whole 
blood and plasma phenytoin concentrations. All animals were observed daily for signs of 
toxicity. Body weight and food conaumptiOn were determined weekly. Detailed phys''"al and 
ophthalmoscopic exams were performed pretest and at termination (week 4 or 8). bamples 
for hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis were obtained prior to termination. Selected 
organs were weighed, and tissues from control and HD groups and liver and injection sites 
from all groups were examined microscopically. Liver from selected controt and HO animals 
were evaluated by EM.

1. Treatment 
Fifteen Sprague Dawley (Chailes River CD) rats/sex/group were randomly assigned to each 
of five treatment groups, to receive either normal saline (controls), phenytoin sodium (positiVe 
control; 100 mg.lkg in 40% propylene glyeol and 10% ETOH), or fosphenytoin (30, 80, or 150 
mg/kg in 0.1 M TRIS buffer) by Intramuscular injection, once daily, for 13 weeks. Ten 
rats/sex/group were designated es main study animals and the remaining 5/sexlgroup were 
used for pharmacokinetic studies. The phenytoin and HD fotphenytoln groups received 
approximately equimolar doaas. Because .;f excessive mortality, the pt'aenytoin group was 
terminated during week 9, and all tests schtjuled for termination were carried out at that 
time. 
Drug lot #: ZB6-7-10 
2. Ob1erv8d sjgos 
Decreased activity, leaning to one side, excessive salivation, and dilated pupils were 
observed in HD fosphenytoin animals. Only excessive salivation was observed in the MD 
group. The phenytoin group exhibited decreased activity, excessive salivation, swollen 
hindlimbs, and autocanibalism of hind limbs. 
3. MgrtaUtv 
In the phenytoin group, 8115 male and 10/15 female rats died by week 8. In the foaphenytoln 
groups, deaths occurred in 1/15 LO females, 1115 MD females, 2115 HD males and 1/15 HD 
females. One saline control female died. Only the phenytoln group and HD foaphenytoln 
group deaths were conaidered treatment-related; the others were thought to be related to the 
blood collection procedure. 
4. ~.Weights and food Consumotion 
a) BWs for males and females in both the HD fo1phenytoin group and the phenytoln 
group were lower than those In the saline control group throughout the treatment 
period. 
b) Food consumption (g/anlmal) for HD fosphenytoin group males was consistently 
lower than salint controls. However, when calculated relative to BW, food 
consumption values (glkg) for both male and female HD animals were generally 
higher than those for the control group. Food consumption In the LO and MD 
fosphenytoin groups was slighUy (<10%) lower than controls. In the phenytoln group, 
both absolute and relative consumption were reduced compared to controls. 
5. Hematoloay (routine hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis tests were crt'lducted on 
all main study rats during week 8 and at termination l 
No treatment-related effects on hematology were observed arnong any of the fosphenytoin­
treated groups. Significant decreans h' RBCs, HGB and HCT, and increases in WBCs 
observed In phenytoin·treated rats we~• attrtbuted to hemorrhage and Infection secondary 
to autocannlbalism il'lduced by the local Irritation of Im phenytoin. 
6. CUnical Chemjstrv 
a) Aspartate and alanine aminotransferaae and alkaline phosphatase levels were 
21 b) elwaltd in the HD foaphenytoin group ( R about 2·fold for all 3 in M & F). Only alight 
increases in alkaline phoaphaiase levels were noted in the phenytoin group. 
NQn..fastad glucose concentrations (from umplea coltt.cted 2 hr after dosing) were 
significantly elevated (4-fold compared to uline) in the HD folphenytoin group. 
Phenytoin had J)reviously been shown to Induce hyperglycemia, presumably by 
Inhibiting Insulin releaH, and glucoM was elevated about 2·fold in the phenytoin 
group at 9 weeks in the current study. A hyperg~mlc effect has also been 
previously shaMi fer fospher.'t(Oin. The hyperglycemia was no longer evident by the 
time routine blood sample~ were collected 24 hr later. 
7. Urin11vs;1 
Glucosuria was observed in both the phenytoin and HD fosphenytoin groups. 
8. Ora1n WelAbts 
a) Absolute and relative liver weights were elevated In MD and liO fo1phenytoin 
groups. primarily In female& (70-80% In HO females). In contrast absolute and 
relative (to brain) liver Mights were decreased In the phenyk\ln group. 
b) Relativ• adrenal weights were Increased In phenytoln group animals, and absolute 
adrenal weights were increased In the HO foaphenytoln group. 
c) Thymus weights were aigniflcantly decreased in HO fosphenytoin males and 
females. while relative thymus nights were signlflcantly decreased In phenytoln 
group females. 
9. Grou PatholoQ.Y 
MacrOIQOpic evidence of tluue lnltatlon at injection sites was oblerved in the phenytoin- and 
fOlphenylDin-tr groupc. Changes ln the ptienytoin group consisted of pockets of fibrous

"8C:"Olll, hemorrhag6 or dilcoknd arua. and pale, firm areu. The le1ion1 were unilateral 
or bilateral, focal, and varted from rnlld to severe. The changes in the fosphenytoln groups 
were dOH-related, and no slgna of autocennlbaliam were seen. 
10. Miqpscopts; Pathology 
a) Injection site -Mlcroacoplc evtdence of Injection 11te lrrttation. con1l1tlng of 
hemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis, min£r1Hzation, and thrombosis, was -n In 
bolh the phenytoin and folphe.nytoin groups. TI"e response was dose-dependent in 
the folphenytoin groups, and the changes were reportedly somewhat leu severe 
th._n In the phenytoin group. 
b) Uwr-Increased inncytoplalmic vacuolization of hepatoeytes was observed in HD 
fosphenytoin animals (8110 males, 9/10 females). Thia was thought to bf: due to 
glycogen accumulation. Single cell ht.J.>.ltocyle necro1is Wiii observed In the 
phenytoin group an•mala (3110 malel, 3110 femalea). 
c) Thymus • Thymulfll of rats In the phenytoin and HO foaphenytoln groups showed 
trace to moderate lymphoid depletion (correlated With dKre1sea In thymus weights; 
considered 1treu-related). 
d) A few •nlmal1 in the phenytoin and HD fotphenytoln groups had cortical cell 
vacuolization or hypertrophy of the w.ireMlt. lhia wa1 11so considered atreaa­

Blood samples were collected from rats designated for blood level studies Immediately prior 
to, and at 30, 60, and 120 min after doling on study days 1, 42, and at termination (Table 
111.4). 
At equimolar doses, peak phenytoin levels were about 3-4 times higher following 
fotphenytoin administration than after phenytoln Injection. Absorption of pnenytoin was 
apparen1ly prolonged, since significant levels w.re meaaured in thl• group prior to doling on

for 13 weeks. A negative COl"ltrol group was administered nline. and a positive control group 
recetved phenytcin sodium on the same regimen. The phenytoln dose was 40 mglkg, which 
was equlmolar to the high foaphenytoln dote. All groups contained 4 males and 4 female 
dogs. 
Drug lot#: Z86-7-1 o 
2. Clinical Signt 
Ataxia, decreased activity, and mucoid diarrhea were observed In the HO fosphenytoin 
group. Emeais and ptyalism were aeen in all fosphenytoin·tre•ted dogs In a dose-related 
manner. Ataxia, emesis, and diarrhea were observed In the phenytoin group, with Incidences 
intermediate between that seen in the MO and HD foaphenytoln groups. Other observations 
made in phenytoin-treated doge include the Inability to bend rear legs, thinness, swollen legs, 
and 1011 of appetite. Dogs In this group also struggled and vocalized during dosing. Both 
phenytoin and fosphenytoin groups exhibited swelling at the injectiOn sites. 
3. Mortality 
All study animals survived until termination. 
4. Body W.ight and F90d Consumption 
BW gain was increased in male fo1ph1nytoin group dogs (1.5X saline controls at HO) and 
slightly decruaed in pnenytoin group males and females compared to qline controls. Food 
consumption was decreased in HD females and in phenytoin group males and females.

appearance of phenytoin levels by 5 min after dosing. Phenytoln levels peaked at 
approximately 60 min after prodrug administration. Peak phenytoin levels in the phei1ytoin 
group were consistently about 3 times lower than those in the equimolar fosphenytoin group.

IV. SPECIAL TOXICITY 
A) VENOUS AND PERIVASCULAR IRRITATION IN RABBITS (RR 745-10724, Vol. 1.20). 
When administered as a 30-min iv infusion (0.05 ml/min) Into the right ear or as a 0.1 ml perivascular 
injection into the left ear, fosphenytoin at concentrations of 10, 25, or 50 mg/ml was no more irritating 
than the saline co.,trol at either site. A concentration of 75 mg/ml resulted In higher (50%) irritation 
scores than the saline control at both sites. PhenytOln concentrations of 16.9, 33.7, and 50 mg/ml 
produced significantly greater microscopic Irritation than did the saline control at the venous site and 
concentrations of 33. 7 and 50 mg/ml produced significantly greater Irritation at the perivascular site. 
The three highest doses of phenytoin were only slightly more irritating than their undiluted vehicle 
(40% propy1ene glycol, 10% alcohol, water -pH adjusted to 12 with NaOH). The irritation produced 
by phenytoin and its vehicle included a high incidence of thrombosis, which was not seen in the 
fosphenytoin groups. 
B) LOCAL IRRITATION AFTER ACUTE IM INJECTION OF RABBITS (RR 745-01737, Vol. 1.20). 
Microscopic irritation scores (slight to moderate) were not different a,,ong injections sites for saline, 
phenytoin vehicle, and phenytoln (50 mg/ml). Irritation scores (minimal to mild) at fosphenytoin ve~icle 
(0.1 M Tris buffer. pH adjusted to 8.8 with HCI) or fosphenytoin (25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/ml) sites were 
statistically lower than those for saline control and phenytoin. 
C) LOCAL IRRITATION AFTER DAILY IM INJECTION OF RABBITS FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS 
(RR 745-01741. Vol. 1.20). 
When a 1 ml volume was injected im into the hlndlil'l,b of rabbits daily for 5 consecutive days, 
fosphenytoin concentrations of 50, 75 and 100 mg/ml produced concentration-dependent irritation 
compared to saline controls (increased serum creatine kinase and irritation scores). Based on 
macroscopic scores and effects on serum CK, phenytoln at 50 mg/ml was more irritating than 
equimolar concentrations of fosphenytoin. Irritation produced by the undiluted phenytoin vehicle was 
comparable in seventy to that seen with formulated phenytoin at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. 
0) HYPERGLYCEMIC EFFECTS IN RATS (RR 745-01734, Vol. 1.20). 
Fosphenytoin (150 mg/kg) or phenytoin (100 mg/kg) were administered by 30 min infusions to 10 
rats/group, and multiple blood and urint:t samples were collected over a 48 hr period. Serum glucose 
concentrations In the fosphenytoin and phenytoin groups were elevated by 30 min after :iv~lng and 
peaked at about 400 mg/dl at 1 hr. Levels were significantly increased for 4-6 hr after 1osing. 
Glucose levels in both groups had returned to normal by 24 hr. Urine glucose levels increaaed during 
the first 12 hr after dosing in both groups compared tc.. saline controls and returned to normal during 
the second 12 hr. Effects on glucose were comparable for the two drugs. 
E) CNS TOXICITY IN MICE (RR 745-01736, vol. 1.20). 
6 mice/group received single Ip injections of equimolar doses of fosphenytoin or pht-nytoin sodium 
solution. Saline and vehicle controls were included. Fosphenytoin at 50 mg/kg or phenytoin at 33 
mg/kg produced no effects. Dose-related CNS toxicity, including decra"'1ed respiration, prostrc1t1on. 
piloerection, trernora. ataxia, sedatk>n, decreased pupil response. reduced righting reflex, decn~ased 
grip strength, decreli .. · ~ body temperature, and death (at 2 highest doses), were observed after 
doses of 100, 200, 500, or 1000 mg/kg of fosphenytoin or 69, 134, 337, or 675 of phanytoin. 
Responses to equlmolar doses of fosphenytoin and phenytoin were similar, but there was a 
suggestion of quantitatively greater effects with fo1phonytoin. These differences may have been d• 1e 
to differences in absorption after Ip administration. 
29 .... 
F) CARDIOVASCULAR TOXICITY IN DOGS (RR 745-01735, Vol. 1.2C'I). 
The cardiovascular effects of fosphenytoin, phenytoin, and their respective vehicles (0.1 M Tris buffer, 
pH 8.8 and 40% propylene glycol, 10% alcohol, pH 12) were compared following iv bolus (3 sec) 
injection to anesthetized tamale dogs (4/group). A saline control waa also included. The phenytoin 
dosage (18 mg/kg) used in iile study was considered to represent• ctinically effective dose for 
treatment of status epilepticua, which would normally be infused OYeJ 20-30 min. The fosphenytoin 
dose (27 mg/kg) was equlmolar. Heart rate, left venbicular dP/dt at 40 mmHg (LVdP/dt), left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), mean arterial preaure (MAP), and Lead II 
electrocardiograms were recorded at frequent Intervals for 1 hour after dosing. Blood samples for 
determination of drug concentrations were collected at each interval. 
Since there were no differences in CV parameters among the three control groups, data from these 
were pooled. Lead II ECG recordings were lirnilar among groups. A slight Increase in QT interval was 
seen in both trt ated groups, but this effect was not considered biologically significant. Intravenous 
phenytoin rnultfJd in decreases In heart rate (80% of baseline), LvdP/dt (max -55% compared to C), 
and MAP (-40% compared to C) and R significant increaJe In LVEDP (2-3-fold). Effects on LVdp/dt 
·~nd L VEOP tasted 3-5 min, while change& in MAP graduaUy returned toward baseline over the so~min 
observatJon period and HR remained low up to 1 hr (Flgure1 IV. 1 and IV .2). Peak phenytoin levels 
in blood occurred at 30 sec after dosing (49 ug/ml) and gradually decreased to 14 ugr1<g at 60 min 
(Table IV.1). Fosphenytoln resulted in more gradual decreases in HR (80% of baseline). LvdP/dt (max 
-36% compared to C), and MAP (-40% compared to C and baseline). Thftse changes peaked at 2-3 
min and then sloWly retL·med toward baseline (HR remained low at 1 hr). EffeciS on L VEOP were 
variable and did not appear to be as pronounced as those produced by phenytoln administration. 
Phenytoin blood levels rose more slowty after fosphenytoln administration, peaking at 5 min after 
doslnv (22 uglml). Effects on CV parameters appeared to correlate with phenytoin blood levels in bOth 
cases. The major differenr.e between drugs was In effects on L VEDP. The less pronounced effects 
seen after fosphenytoin pr~sumably reflect the lower peak blood level of phenytoin resulting from its 
administration.

IN VITRO EFFECTS ON HUMAN Blf)QO (RR 745-01746, Vol. 1.20). 
Washed cell and plasma from blood collected from 4 human donors were mix~ with various 
concentrations of fosphenytoin and phenytoin and compared to positive ~ntrcls for hemolysis and 
ptasma protein flocculation by measuring hemoglnbin concentration or optical density. Fosphenytoin 
produced littte hemolysis (<0.7%) at a·1y of the concentrations tested (0.15 -75 mg/ml). Phenytoln 
produced only slight hemotysis (<3.6o/o) at concentrations up to 5 mgJkg, but essentially complete 
hemolysis was seen at 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml. Fosphenyto1n produced no plasma protein flocculation 
at any concentration tested. Phenytoln produced mild flocculation at 20 mg/ml but none at lower or 
higher concentrations, indicating that th:S , nay h&Vd been an anomalous result. No explanation for the 
difference in hemolytic effects was prcvidtJO. 
H) POTENTIAL RISK.ASSOCt."\TED w;n~ SYSTEMIC FORMALOE: vo~ (RR-MEMO 745-01786, Vol. 
1.31) 
Form~idehydtt i-$ :o. ·~ , !ed during the conversion of fosphenytOin to phenytoin by tissue 
phosphat.a"Y.:s (t1/2 !rpro~i:T'~' · 9 min in humans). The theoretical maximum dose of formaldehyde, 
ars.uming complete, ir.•·t:ntaneo... ·-.. 11Wt.i~!un after an iv dose of 2100 hlg fosphenytoin (said to be 
r:laximum hL:O'riJ11 h.' dose), ano based on a 1: 1 molilr ratio, would be 155.3 mg (5.17 mmol) or 3. 1 
mglkg (50 kg SW). The theoretical "1dXimal rate of exposure to formaldehyde was calculated as 0.22 
mg11<glmin, based on a fosphenytoin infusion rate of 150 mg/min. (The proposed maximum dose and 
rate are now 30 mg/kg and 225 mg/min, respectively.) 
The pharmacokinetics of formaldehyde and its major metabolite formate were modeled using data 
from a published report (McMartin et at., Biochem Pharmacot 28:845-649, 1979) in which 
formaldehyde (30 mg/kg) was administered iv to monkeys. Using this model, peak formaldehyde and 
formate concentrations resulting from first order input of 3 mg/kg formaldehyde, With a formation half­
life of 8 rnin, were simulated (Figures IV. 3 and IVA). Peak formaldehyde levels were predicted to 
be approximately 0.18 mmoVL, with concentrations declining to background levels (0.027-0.068 
mmol/L) within 20 min. Maximal formate levels were predicted to be 0.08 mmoUL, which Is below the 
baseline levels measured in 2 monkeys in the same published study (0.18 and 0.27 mmoUL). These 
are worst case simulations analogous to a bolus dose of 2100 mg of fosphenytoln. Background levels 
of formate in humans have been reported in the literature to be 3 to 19 mg/L (0.07 to 0.4 mM). 
Elevations in formate levels were expected to be transient. since an elimination t1/2 of about 11 mi;, 
was predicted. Metabolic acidosis and other characte istics of methanol poisoning reported in 2 
monkeys following administration of a high dose of methanol (3 g/kg) were associated with plasma 
formate levels of 6.4 and 10.5 mmoVL (McMartin et al., above). Plasma formate levels measured in 
4 healthy volunteers following administration of 1200 mg of fosphenytoln by iv lnf\.lsioo ~ver 30 min 
were not significantly different from thos~ observed in a placebo group (N=5) or from baseline levels, 
which averaged about 25 mg/L. It is thought that endogenous production of formaldehyde during 
normal metabolism in humans amounts to about 36 g/day in a 50 kg person; thus, the estimated 
maximal amount of formaldehyde added as a result of fosphenytoin administration (3.1 mg/kg) 
represents about 0.5% of the daily body burden due to metabolism. 
Since the theoretical maximum dose of formaldehyde represents only a fracticn of the total tiody 
burden from normal metabolism, and since the PK simulations indicated that formaldehyde 
concentrations would exceed background levels for a relatively short time, the sponsor considers the 
potential risks associated with formaldehyde exposure as a result of fospher.ytoin administration to 
be negligible.

3~1 V. GENETIC TOXICOLr,GY (Vol. 1.31) 
A) AMES TEST (RR 745-01958) 
Fosphenytoin was tested with Salmonella strains TA-98, TA-100, TA-1535, TA-1537, and TA-1538, 
both with and without metabolic activation. In initial rangefinding tests. no toxicity to the 
background lawn occurred, by either plate incorporation or preincubation methods, over 
concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5000 L'91plate. No Increase in revertants occurred for any strain 
in these tests. Confirmatory tests were performed by the plate incorporation methOd in triplicate 
with concentrations ranging from 312.5 to 5000 uglplate. The positive controls produced 
appropriate increases in revertant frequency with each strain, and all background frequencies were 
within historical ranges. No toxicity to the background lawns occurred. Statistically significant 
trends wer~ seen in TA-100, with and without activation, and with TA-98 without activation; 
however, the increases were relatively small and not considered biologieally signifieant. The 
sponsor pointed out that greater (statistically significant) increases in revertant frequency were 
seen with placebo (Tris buffer vehicle) in both of these strains. The maximum response with TA-
100 was 1.4-fold the background level at 5000 uglplate without activation, while the maximum 
increase with TA-98 was 1.7X the background at 625 and 1250 ug/plate without activation.

8) MUTATION ASSAY IN V79 CHINESE HAMSTER LUNG CELLS (RR 745-01935) 
V79 Chinese hamster lung cell cultures were exposed to fosphenytoin for 3 hr in the pre-?ence and 
absence of 59. The concentrations ranged from 100 to 4000 ug/ml in both studi~s. In dose 
range-finding for :ytotoxicity, the high concentration prOduced no effect on cell survival in the 
absence of 59, but ::i the presence of 89 there was a 89% reduction In cell survival at 4000 ug/ml. 
In the 2 nonactivated mutation (HGPRT locus) assay trials, the presence of fosphenytoin did not 
produce an increase in mutant frequency. The positive control (ethyl methanesulfonate) produced 
appropriate incre3&8S In both trials (>4X background), but the magnitude of the response differed 
markedly between trials (68.2 and 836.4 mutants/108). All background frequencies were within 
the acceptable range (0-15 mutants/108). 
In both activation trials, the positive control (benzo(a)pyrene) prvduced appropriate increases In 
mutant frequency, and background frequencies were within the acceptable range. Cell viability 
was reduced by about 40-50% (relative to vehicle controls) at the maximum fosphenytoin 
concentration in both trials. In trial 1, there was a significant quadrat!c tr·~"d due to an Increase 
in mutation frequency at two intermediate drug concentrations (23 and 24 mutants/106 at 1000 and 
2000 ug/ml, respectively, versus 11 mutants/101 in vehicle controls). Although not significant by 
linear de lEt trend analysis, the effect met other criteria for a positive assay, ie, mutant frequency 
at least 2X vehicle control at two or more contiguous drug concentrations and exceeding 20 
mutants per 101 viable cells with at least one concentration. In trial 2, however, no effect on 
mutation frequency was seen In forphenytoln exposed cultures.

C) CHROMOSOME ABERRATION iN V79 CHINESE HAMSTER LUNG CELLS (RR '745-02101) 
F osphenytoin, at concentratiOns up to 4000 ug/ml (high concentration arbitrarily chosen in the 
absence of cytoteixicity or insolubility), was teated for its ability to induce structural chromosome 
aberrations (SCA) in cultured V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. 
34 
• In assays performeawithout SS activation, with tosphenytoin concentrations from 500 to 4000 
ug/ml, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells with aberrations at 
the 12 hr harvest time after exposure to 4000 uglml (8.5o/o vs 2.So/o in vehicle control; 14 and ·1s% 
after 1 and 1.25 ug/ml mitomycin C). Because this finding did not satisfy the pre-established 
criteria of statistically significant increases at 2 consecutive concentrations, with at least one 
response exceeding the historical control range (0..5% with 59, 0-6.3% without 59), it was not 
considered to be biologically significant. 
Fosphenytoin was tested In the presence of S9 in 3 eeparate trials. In the first trial, the positive 
control (cyclophoaphamide) did not significantly increase SCA at either concentration, so the trial 
was considered invalid (data not submitted). In the second trial (Table V.1), with concentrations 
ranging from 1 OOQ..4000 ug/ml, the percentage of cells with aberrations and the mean number of 
aberrations per cell were both significantly increased at all concer~tions and at both harvest 
times (18 & 24 hr). In many cases, these values were higher than those in the positive cont1ol 
groups, which were also significantly increased. In a third trial (Table V.2), with lower 
concentrations o. fosphenytoin (125-2000 ug/ml), no significant increase in chromosomal 
aberrations was obr.ctrved at any dor..e or harvest time. However, the positive control significantly 
increased SCA only at the highest concentration and only at 1 of the 2 harvest times (18 hr) in this 
trial (met sponsors minimum criteria • ''&lid assay). 
The sponsor postulat~:d that the clastogenic effect was due to the generation of formaldehyde In 
vitro. Phenytoin wa.s reprJrtedly not clastogenic In previous studies with CHO cells (literature 
ref"rences), while formaldehyde has been reported to Induce chromosomal aberrations In vitro in 
CHO cells at concentrations as low as 5 uglml (literature reference). However, attempts to 
measure formaldehyde in cultures in the present study were unaucce11ful. Addition of 
formaldehyde dehydrogenase to the S9 would have been an altemate approach. The degradation 
product diphenylhydantoic acid, which was said to be present at 1.5 to 2% of total drug In these 
studies (prior to metabo .. :-activation), was considered unlikely to be invoived, but this possibility 
was not investigated.

0) MOUSE MICRONUCLEUS (RR 745--01898) 
Micronucleus formation in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs} was determined In 
groups of male and female mice (S/sex/group/time) after administration of single Iv doses of 
fosphenytoin (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg). The doses were chosen on the basis of a previous acute 
iv infusion stl.ldy Showing 50 mg/k'} to be a no-effect dose and 234 mg/kg to be the combined sex 
LOSO. In the present study, clinical signs were seen at the MD and HO, but no deaths occurred. 
Significant decreases in PCE/total erythrocyte ratios were seen In HO groups, indicating bone 
marrow toxicity. Small, but statistically significant (by trend but not pair-wise analysis) increases 
in micronucteated PCEs (MNPCEs) were observed at 24 and 48 hr sacrifice times in HD animals 
when sexes were combined. The elevation in MNPCE frequency was less than twice the placebo 
contro: rate and was within the historical control range. No significant differences wertt detected 
in the analysis of Individual sex MNPCE data. The poaltlva control (cyclophosphamide) produced 
a signlftcant Increase (about 12X) in mean MNPCE values at 12 hr compared to vehicle (saline) and 
placebo (Tris buffer) controls.

In 1 1tudy comparlng th• hemodynamlc errtcta of Iv lnfu1lon ot equlmolar amountl or to1ph1nytoln or

The cardiovaacular effecta of equimoler doses of pher1ytoln (18 mg/kg) anti foaphenvtoln (27 mg/1"g) ~re 
comparable foUONing Iv bolus (3 11e) Injection to an11th1tized fem111 dogs (4/group). Intravenous phenytoin 
resulted in decreases in heart rate (800/o of blaellne), LvdPldt (max -55% comp•red to C). and MAP (-40% 
compared to C) 1nd 1ignlftcantly increased LVEOP (2-3-fold). Foaphenytoln resulted in more gradual 
decreases in HR (80% of baletine), L.vdP/dt (max -36% compared to C), and MAP (~0% compared to c and 
b•••hne). Effeot1 on LVEDP were variable and did not appear to be ae pronounced 11 those produced by 
phenytoin admlnislrltlOn. Effecta on CV paramater1 appeared to correl•t• with phenytoln blood levela In both 
cases. The major difference between drugs was In effects on L VEDP. The le11 pronounced ertocts 1ean after 
fo1phenytoin presumably reflect the lower peak blOOd level of phenytoln roaultlng from lta administration (22 
ug/ml vs 49 ug/ml 1fter phenytoln admlnlatratlon). (Flgurea IV. 1 & IV.2 and T•bl• JV.1).

BEPBODUCIIVE TOXICITY 
Segment I (m•l•J 
Male rats (40/grp) were doaed wtth a. 2&, 75, or 150 mg/kg, Im, for 75 days prior to mating and throughout 
55 ... 
mating with untreated females (1:1 cohabitatiC'n, 10 day maximum), then aacnflced. Females were either 
sacrificed on Day 21 of gestation (1/2) or allowed to dellv•r and wean their offspring. Patemfil toxicity, 
characterized by Clinical slgna (injection 1ite le1ion1, neurotoxicity) and euppression of BW gain, occurred 
at the MD and HD. Two HO m1l11 died and 2 were sacrificed moribund. Mean plasma phenytoin 
concentrations ranged from 1bout 5 (LO) to 45 ug/ml (HO) and did not appear to accumulate during 
treatment. No T -R effects were apparent for male reproductive parameters, incll..'dlng semen evaluation 
FO fertility ind1cea were deere111d compared to hlatoncal data, but both control and treated rnale1 were 
affected. No biologically significant ertect1 on female reproductive or fetal paramete"' wer'! observed at 
C-1ection. There was a slight increase In stunted fetun1 (<4 g) at the HO, but the v1lud was within the 
hlatorical control range. In htter11 from femaln allowed to deliver, there were no T -R ertecta on reproductive 
parameter& or on neonatal growth, aurvtval, and acquisition of developmental landmark•. In addition, no 
group differences were found in several poatweanlng t"t' of neurobehavloral function, ind there were no 
treatment effects on F 1 reproductive ptJrameters. 
S11gm11nr I ff11malt1J 
Female rats (40/grp) were dosed with O (v1hicl1), 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, Im, for 15 day• prior to mating 
with untreated m1le1, 1nd throughout mating, geatatk>n, and lactation. C·1ect1on1 were performed on 1/2 
of the female• on Day 21 of geatlltion; remaining femlt• were allowed to deliver and wean their offspring. 
A high incldenc. of neuroto>Cidty (hypoact.vlty, ataxia, and prostration) was ob1erved in HD fernalea, which 
ia con1l1tent with the blood lev111 achl•vld 1t thl• dose (33-38 ug/ml). Slmilar CNS 1ign1 have been 
rt.ported at pluma phenytoin level• >25-30 ug/ml, in rats and humane. BW gain wa1 decrt111d In MO and 
HO female• dunng the premating and gestation period•. E1trou1 cyclea were altered at th• MO ind HO, 
but mating and fertility Indices were unaffected. Parturition w11 1ignlftcantty delayed at the HO, and 
dlaturbed at all doses. Fo1phenytoln produced developmental toxicity primarily 1t the HD (decreaaed 
growth, 1ncrea1ed Intrauterine and po1tn1t11 death, m11formation1, functional 1ffect1; T1blH Vl.3·S), 
although there were effect• on growth at the MD. The MO and HO produced pe1k m1temal pl11m1 
phenytoln concentrat1on1 of approximately 20 and 40 ug/ml, respectively (10·20 ug/ml considered 
therapeutic). Teratogeniolty (cardiac, digit, brain anom1lle1) was slgnlftcant at the HO; however, th• 
occl1rrence of • b,..ln m11form1tlon In a 11ngle LO fetua may have been drug-Induced, alnce brain 
melformationa are rare and have been previously reported after pr1n•t1I ph1nytoin exposure. 
Chromod1cryorrh1a and circling were teen tn HD offlprlng; th11e have been previoualy reported after 
prenatal phenytoin exposure. 
Segment II f r11tJ 
Pregnant rats (40/group) wer1 treated with O (vehicle), 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg, iv, on gestation D•v• 7 
through 17. C~1ectlon1 were performed on 25/group on Day 21: the rem1lnlng 15/group were allowed to 
dehver and rear ottaprlng. M1t1m11 toxicity occurred primarily In HD dams and consisted of death (4 HD 
dams), cllnlcal algna (aalivation. chewing, atM><ia, hypoactlvlty, and limb rigidity), and 1uppr1111on of BW 
gain. Mun maternal plasma ph1nytoin 1lv1l1at1 hr po1tdo1lng (approximate Cma>C) were 4, 24, and 43 
ug/ml In LO, MD, and HO groupt, respectively. At C-11ctlon, poatimplantatlon 1011 w11 lncreaaed (2-fold) 
1n HD dams compared to concurrent and hlatorlcal controla. Mean fetal BW w11 decre11ed (30% below 
VC) In th• HO group. tncid1nce1 of skeletal malformatlon1, extemal/Vtaceral v1rtatlon1, and 1k1letal 
vanatlon1 were lncreaaed In HD titters (Table Vl.7). Although ct111iflld 11 malform1tlon1, several of the 
skeletal anomallea (hemlcentra) may have reflected retarded 011iftcatlon. Th• lncreaae In v1rtation1 wa1 
due to 1 marked lncr111e In growth retarded fetu1e1 in HD litters: 60% of HO fetu1e1 were atunted (BW 
<4 g). Among dama allowed to deliver, the duration of ge1tatlon w11 algnlflcantly Increased at th• HD. 
Poatlmplantatlon 1011 wa1 1lightly incre11ed at tho MD and HD (Table VI.I). Birth weight• ind postnatal 
wetght gain were dlcreued in HO malu and female• (10-16%). V1gln11 opening waa d•t•yld In MD end 
HO female puJ>t. Two llttermates In the HD group exhibited abnormal circling behavior, and 27 pupa fmm 
8 HD litters had chromod1cryorme1. Both have previoualy been 11aoclated with prenatal phenyt•>ln 
56 exposure. One of the HD c1rc1'era later died (PND 23). Locomotor activity waa increased In HO males on 
PNO 42; however, this waa mostly due to increaaed activity in a 1ingl1 HD pup. No group differences were 
found in acoustic startle parametel'1 on P 43 or In 1huttla avoidance parameters during week 9. 
Segment II (rabbit} 
Pregnant rabbits (20/group) were treated with 0 (vehicle), 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, iv, on g111t1Uon d•Y• 6 
through 18. C@MCtiona were performed on Day 30 of geatation. Mat1m11 toxicity, characterized by cllnlcal 
1ign1 (chewing motions, 11taxla, limb rigidity, and ah1llow, rapid breathing) and suppre11lon of BW gain, 
occurred at the MO and HD. Mean matem•I pl11m1 phenytoin levels increased proportionally from about 
7 (LO) to 35 uglml (HO). No TwR effects on maternal reproductive or fetal developmental parameters were 
apparent at C·aection. 
S11gmt1nt Ill 
Female rats (25/group) were treated with O (vehlele), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, Iv, from Day 15 of pregnancy 
through Oay 20 postpartum. Maternal toxicity, charact1rtzld by death, significant reduction• In BW gain, 
and clinical 1ign1 (ataxia, hypoactiVity, 1nd lmballne9), wa1 ob1erved prlmarUy In HO group fem1te1. A 
0-R Increase in g11tatlon length was ... n In treated d•m•, and powtlmpl1ntat1on 1011 w11 do••· 
dependently Increased at all doses (Table Vl.10). Pup aurvival and BW at birth were 1lgnlflcant1y 
decr1a1ed at the HD, but were lower than control• at 111 do111. Th• effect on BW perslated Into the 
maturation pertod In HO group offspring. lncr1aud pup mortality and reduced Po1tnat1I growth have 
previously been reported after Or91 1dmlnl1tratton of 100 or 200 mg/kg of phenytoln on Daya 7-18 of 
ge1tat1on. There wa1 no lncro11• in malformation• among foaphenytotn e>epo1ed offspring, but treatment 
started after the major period of organogene1i1. An lncreaaed lncktenc. of 1tructural v1rlatlon1 In fetu111 
from dame that dted around the time of parturmon can be attributed to developmental delay. Hyperactivity 
wa1 apparent In all treatment group male offlprtng, but v1lu11 for activity parameter1 were outtlde the 
control range prtmanly In HO offspring. Enhanced avoidance responding and apparent memory 
enhancement were aeen In treatment group offspring (MD & HO m1te1, HD t1m11e1), probably due to 
exposure-induced hyperactiVity. Clrellng behavior, whieh h11 previoualy bun reported following prenatal 
exposure to phenytoin Ind wn Hin In the aegment II 1tudy, w11 not ob11rved In this study. No apparent

Fo1phenytoln Is a water soluble phosphate titer prodrug of phenytotn, Intended 11 a replar.ement for 
parentaral phenytoin (poony soluble, requires an alkaline organic solvent and precipitates in iv fluid•). 
Foaphenyto1n is quantitatively converted to phenytoln in vivo by ubiQultou1 pho1ph1ta1e1, With a conversion 
half-life of about 8, 3, and < 1 rnln In man, dog, and rat, respectively. Becauu of the phosphate 11ter, 150 mg 
foaphenytoin Vteldl 100 mg phenytoin Thft properties of phenytoin are well a1tabli1hed; th•refore, the primary 
safety 1Hues wtth fosphenyto1n relate to poHlble dltf1renc:31 In th• pharmaeologicallto><ioologtcal praflle of 
phenytoin reaultmg from administration of the prodrug. Th••• differences could involve Intrinsic ettecta of 
fosphenytoin, changes In phenytoin disposition, or effects of breakdown products, aa diacu111d below. 
Fo1phenyto1n and phenytoin were equipotent 1g11n1t MES·lndue&d ••lzure1 In mice after 01111, Ip, or iv 
admin11tration (T1ble Vlll.1). Although time cour1e1 of antlc-0nvul1•nt action were comparable when th• two 
drugs were given iv, there was some lndlc.tion of• delayed onaet after foaphenytoin •dminl•tnltlon. This 
delay could be import.nt in the treatment of 1tatu1 •;>lleptJcua. A pubUahed 1tudy by Watton and Trolman 
(Epilepay R11 5:165-8,'90) indicated that foaphenytoln Wll 1811 effective than phenytoln in a rat model of 
1t1tu1 •Pll•pticua. Although 11mil1r final pl11ma and brain phenytoln concentration• were reached attar Ip 
administration of the two drugs, a slower nse In brain phenytoln lev111 following fo1phenytoln 1dmlnl1tr1tlon 
was thought to reduce its 1nticonvul1ant efficacy In thl• •nlmal model (Figure Vlll.1). Thus, the time required 
for conver1ion of foaphenytoln to phenytoln could have a n1g1tiv1 Impact on the effectlven111 of trHtment. 
However. clinical Iv PK studies have shown that free phenvtoin concentration·tlme profUe1 almll•r to tho•• 
Hfln with Pl'rtnteral phenytotn can be obtained by lncrualng the fo1phenytotn lnfuaton rate. Thi• 11 partly due 
to altered protein binding of phenytoln In the pre1ence of foaphtnytoln. In vitro 1tudle1 .ind clinical PK datll 
Indicate that foaphenytoln dl1place1 pt'tenytoln from pl••m• binding 1lt11, le, the phanytoln free fractton 
lncr•••ed with increa11ng foaphenytoin concentrations. In human volunteera, the 1>et1nt of Ph•nytoln

seen after admlniatration of an equimolar dose of phenytoin at the maximum recommended rate of 50 mg/min. 
Such infusion rates of fo1phenytoin are reportedly well tolerated. At 1teldy-1tate, administration of 
fosphenytoin could enhance the pharmacological or toxlcOloglcal •ffecta of phenytoln by dlaplaclng It from lta 
binding 1ite1, although the 1ncre111 in free fr1ctlon wuuld be tranalenl T'ie potential for 1uch dlaplac.ment 
effects w11 not addressed in the preclinical 1tudle1; free phenytoin level• were not determined In any of the 
in vivo animal atudlea. 
Phenytoin h•• been shown to produce 1ignlftcant reduction• In blood pr111ure when lnfuu.'Ct Iv In both •nlmal1 
and man. Ph1nytoin-1nduced hypoten1lon appe1rs to be dependent on both total doae and rate of lntuak>n. 
The ma>clmum recommended adult hum1n lntu1lon rate 11 40-50 mg/min ind the total dun 11 u1ualty limtted 
to 1250-1500 mg. In a 1tudy comparing the nemoctynamlc 1ffectl of phenytoln and fosphenytoln In dogs, 
qualitatiVety and quanutatiYely almitar chllnga In CV param1tera were 1Hn: both drugs produced comparable 
decreases In btood pressure, heart rate, and contractillty. When the CV effecta of foaphenytoln (21 mg/kg PE) 
infusion over 15·30 min were compared wtth thou IHn after lnfualon of an equlmolar doae of ph1nytoln over 
30 min, the maximum effect• were n11rty Identical and were ob11rv1d at compmr•bl• pl••ma l1vel1 of 
phenytoln (Flgurn l.M). The rapidity or fosphenytoln lnfualon (Within the range t11ted) appeared to affect 
th• on1et but not the maximum response. At time• when plasma level• of both foaphenytoln and phenytoln 
(formed from foephenytoin) were high, •ffeeta were not greater than thou seen at comi)arable levela of 
phenytoln alone: therefore, It did not appear that fo1phenytoln hid any 1lgnlftcant hemodynamlc •fflcta of ltl 
own. When higher equimolar do1e1 (40 mg/kg PE) were r1pldly lnfu1ed (over 2 min), the magnitude of the 
changee in CV parameters produced by foaphanytoln 1ppe1red to btt aomewn1t greater than those '"" with 
phenytoln (Flgur111.1·3). However, 3 of tht phenytotn-tre1ted an1m111 (le, the most 1en1tttve to CV effects) 
died within 4 min of Infusion onset following marked rtductlona In MAP and HR, while all 8 fo1phenytoln dog• 
recovered: to the means depicted In the figure• may be mialadlng. Although the CV change• produced by 
foaphenytoin 1eemed to correlate with plaama level• of phenytoln, and 1imltar peak total phenytc:ln 
concentr1tion1 were achieved after phenytoin or foaphenytoln adminlatration, It 11 possible that th• 
59 displacement effect descrtbeQ..in the preceding paragraph resulted in higher maximal free phenytoin levels 
follow1ng rapid foaphenytoin infu11on, which might have contrit>uttd to any increased response observed. In 
addltiOn, formaldehyde formation could have added to Ule CV effects seen after rapid lnfu11on of fo1phenytoin. 
Formaldehyde has been s~own to decr111e the rate and contractllity of isolated rat atria In vitro, and 
cardiodepre111on has been reported In rats infuaed wtth 0.12 mmoVkg/mln formaldehyde (Strubelt et al. J 
ToxlCOI Clln Toxleol 28:221-33.'90). The rate of foaphenytoin infusion In the dog atudy was 0.08 mmol/kg/min. 
However. the theontUcal maximal rate of exposure to formaldehyde clinlealty, ba1td on the proposed m.tximal 
rat• of fosphenyto1n adm1ni1tration (225 mg/min), would be 0.01 mmoVkg/mln (eO kg BW). Foaphenytoin 
exhibited lntrtnalc activity only in one in vitro a11ay: th• prodrug Inhibited developed tanaion in a guln•• pig 
left atrial preparation 'Alth 1 potency equivalent t~ that of phanytoln. Fo1phenytoln WIS Inactive In l1olattd right 
guinea pig atria, however. Thi• in vitro effect is unexplained but unlikely to be of any cllnle1t importllnce. 
The tox1cologlcal profile CJf fo1phenytoin wa1 e11entl1lty the aame 11 that of phtnytoln. The acute toxicity of 
foaph•nytoin w11 equivalent to that of phenytoin when the two drug1 were administered by Iv infu11< n (30 
min) to mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs (Tabla m.1). Howewr, phenytoln wa1 more toxic thin fo1phenyto1n after 
single iv bolus admlnlatratlon to r1t1. prob1bly due to • mar• gradual rtn In phenytoin levela when 
fo1phenytoln waa given. When comp1red on an equlrnolar ba1i1, Im fosphenytoln prOducad more acute 
1y1ttmic toxicity than ph.-nytoin In r1t1 and dogs, pr11umably due to better 1b1orptlon by thla route (Table 
111.2). Foaphenytoln pro,iuced 1111 injection site irrttatjon than phenytoln by bOth th• Iv and Im route•. 
Unfortunately, the onty multiple doae toxicity 1tudle1 that included 1 phenytoln poaltiv• control were th• 3

The Carcinogenicity and Pregnancy sectJons of the labeling are inaccurate and/or inadequate. Despite the 
findings in Chinese hamster lung cells, the 1t1tement Is made that fosphenytoin was neither mutagenic nor 
clastogenic. The pregnancy category should be 0, based on the known· or at least strongly suspected -
human developmental toxicity of phenytoln; and since phenytoln has a pregnancy waming, fosphenytoin 
warrants the same. The warning needs to be 11pdateid or rewritten by the sponsor so that the information 
reflects the current sclentlflc conaenaus regrrding the 1ft1ct1 of phenytoln on human development. Where

1S6 IMPORTANT NOTE ... 
A previous Division of Biopharmaceutics reviewer requested that the Human 
Phannacokinetics and Bioavailability portion of the NDA be written with fosphenytoin doses 
and administration rates expressed in phenytoin equivalenu. Since the molecular weight of 
fosphenytoin is 1.SX the molecular weiaht of phenytoin, phenytoin equivalents were 
calculated by multiplyina the dose or adminstration rate of fosphenytoin by 0.67. 
Not all of the NDA hu fosphenytoin doses and rates expreaed in term:t of phenytoin 
equivalents. Fosphenytoin wu initially developed b! and Parke-Davis 
did not conven ' studies to express fosphenytoin do1e1 and rates in phenytoin 
equivalents. 
The studies conducted after Parke-Davis' acquisition of fosphenytoin are the most 
critical in evaluatin& the application. Thus, they constitute the majority of the Synopsis and 
Summary. In order to provide consistency between photocopied pCll'tions of the NOA and 
portions of the review constructed d~ novo by the reviewer, doses and rates of fosphenytoin 
will be expressed in phenytoin equivalents in all portions of this review prior to the 
individual study reports. The convention used in the individual study reports ( Appendix 2 ) 
varies accordina to that used in the NDA and is detailed below. 
The following studies were conducted by doses and rates are expressed 
WITHOUT conversion to phenytoin equivalents: 98201, 98202, 9820~, 98206, 98207, 
98210, and 98211. Studies 98213, 98214, 98215, 98216, 98218, 98220, and 98224 have 
doses and rates of fosphenytoin expressed as phenytoin equlvalenta. 
Durin1 site visits by the Division of Sciendftc Investi1ations, it wu determined that 
pluma concentration measurements of fosphenytoin from studies conducted by Parke·Davis 
were inaccurate due to an error in the wei1hin1 of standards. This error did not affect 
dosina of fosphenytoin. Parke-Davis hu since determined that the accuracy of pluma 
concentration measurements of fosphenytoin from studies is uncertain. A description 
of these·inaccuracies is given in the •Response to BIRs identified in 483 Forms" secdon of 
this review ( p.zo). The errors in fosphenytoin concentrations have NOT been documented 
in the individual study rtporu (Appendix 2 ). The values have little bearina on the 
interpretation of studies -the specie of clinical interest is aenerally plasma phenytoin, not 
pluma fosphenytoin. The errors are accounted for in all portions of this review prior to the 
individual study reports ( Appendix 2 ). 
3 Synopsis ... 
Fosphenytoin is a phosphate ester prodru& of phcnytoin developed u an alternative 
for parenteral phenytoin. Only one fosphenytoin formulation ( the tO@bc .. muketed 
formulation ) was studied clinically. Since fosphenytoin is a phenytoin prodrug and no new 
therapeutic claims beyond those approved for parenteral. phenytoin are being made, proof-of 
efficacy studies were not conducted. Rather, the development pro1rarn hopes to establish 
that fosphcnytoin and phenytoin are bioequivalent sources of phenytoin. 
Study 98224 demonstrates that using the 909' confidence intuval approach and the 
log 80 -125 ~ C. I. criteria, 1200 mg of IV fosphcnytoin at 150 ma/min is bioequivalent to 
1200 m1 IV phenytoin at ~O mg/min in terms of maximal free phenytoin concentration 
observed (Cmax) and area under the free concentration/time curve from t • 0 to the least 
quantifiable concentration (AUC0• n.oc>· A desired indication for fosphenytoin is treatment 
of acute status epilepticus. Because rapid attainment of sufficient phcnytoin pluma 
concentration is critical in treatment of status epilepticus, analyses were performed to 
compare cumulative AUC over time. Usina the forementioned confidence interval approach, 
cumulative AUC,,..,... following administration of 1200 mg of fosphenytoin at 150 mg/min is 
bioequivalent to the cumulative AUC,,.,._ followina 1200 mg of phenytoin at ~Oma/min 
from 30 minutes onward. At doses of 1200 ma '"'d rates of ~O and 100 mg/min, 
fosphenytoin is equivalent to 1100 m1 phenytoin dosed at SO ma/min in terms of total Aue,,. ... but not Cmax,,. .... 
Fosphenytoin exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics: u dose and rate of administradon 
are increased, clearance increases. Fosphenytoin is hi&hly protein bound, and its non-linear 
clearance is hypothesized to result from protein binding considerations: u dose and rate of 
administration increase, protein binding saturates and greater concentrations of free drug are 
avaibible to be cleared. Independent of dose and rate of administration fosphenytoin is a 
short-lived specie; terminal elimination half-life of the drug is approximately 15 min and, 
re1ardless of dose or rate of admini•tration, fosphenytoin is rarely quantiftable 5 hrs post .. 
dosina. The conversion of fosph..-nytoin to phenytoin is consistent and essentially complete. 
Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin is readily absorbed when administered IM. Average 
bioavailability of phenytoin from 2SO ma of IM fosphenytoin is 101 ". 
Study 98207 examined the disposition of fosphenytoin in renal failure and hepatically 
compromised patienu. Posphenytoin clearance is more than 2 .. fold u areat in cirrhosis 
patients and about 1. 8-fold u great in renal failure patients u in healthy volunteers. This is 
consistent with decreases in pluma protein concentrations in these patients reducin1 
fosphenytoin bindin& and increasina the concentration of fosphenytOin available to be cltared. 
Because treatment of status epilepticus often includes concomitant administration of 
phenytoin and diazepam, a drua interaction study of fosphenytoin with diazepam was 
performed. Neither dru& affected the pharmacokinetics of the other. However, subnwdmal 
doses of fosphenytoin and diazepam were used in the study. 
4 ... Th: analytical methodology presented throughout the NOA was a validated 
assay. However, commercially Jlvailable fluorcsence immunoassays for phenytoin are 
routinely used to monitor phenytoin plasma concentrations. Cross-ructivity of these assays 
to fosphenytoin occurs. 
Differences in fosphenytoin disposition between ~e. gender, race or any other sub~ 
aroup were not observed and there is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacok.inetics due 
to differences in fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. 
Recommendation: 
The Human Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability portion of New Drug Application 
20-4SO meets the requirements of the Division of Pharmaceutical Evaluation I, Office of 
Clinical Pharmacoloay and Biophannaceutics. Our labeUna revisions have been included in 
the comprehensive copy of labeling provided as Appendix 1 of this review. Plaase note the 
"Comments to the Medical omcer" below. 
Comments to the Medical orncer: 
1. Study 98207, Conyeaion Of CJ .. 982 To Phooytoin lnhticnb With Renal QI 
Hepatic Djwso .. A Pilot Study, wu performed at low dose and low rate of 
fosphenytoin ( 2SO m1 at 8.3 ma I min ), and did not measure free phenytoin. The 
use of low dose and low rate fosphenytoin is not optimal because the conditions with 
areatest potential for maximal deviation from the norm are high dose and hi&h rate. 
Failure to measure free phenytoin is problematic because it is free phenytoin which 
would be best correlated with efficacy and toxicity. Althouah the results obtained do 
allow the sponsor to label that fosphenytoin clearance is enhanced in patients with 
renal or hepatic disease, they are of little value in advisina a clinician on how to 
administer high dose and high rate fosphenytoin ( u would be recommended in status 
cpilepticus) to individuals who are hepatically or renally compromised. 
This study does demonstrate that neither renal nor hepatic disease have marked 
effects on the extent of conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin.

30 m1 I 30 min. Althouah a drug interaction wu not observt.d in this study, the

Fosphenytoin sodium (bmeafter referred to u folpbeaytoill) ia a prodnl1 of me • 
anticonvulsant pbenytoin, bWmded for puenteral administration. Pospbeaytoin ia

fosphenytoin prior to convonion to phenytoin. 
2.3.2. Sclentlftc Rationale 
Parenteral phenytoiD ia med for the acute trel!llleat and CODtJOl of seizu111 in patients 
with status epilepticus, for tbe tnatment or pl'O}Jbylaxil of aeizures in padata with 
epilepsy or ill neuroauqical patienu, and u a substitute for on1 pbenytoin when oral 
administration is not feasible. The current parenteral formulation ls pnspand in a 
vehicle of 40• propylene pycol aad 101 ethanol adjusted to pH 12 wiib aodlum 
hydroxide, and can be actmbdllend either Intravenously or intramuscularly. 
Intravenous administration of phenytoin often p:oducea local pain and bumia& and bas 
also been usoclated with hypoumsion, cudiac rhythm disturbancel, and aevere tluue 
necrosis following exuavaudon. Intramuscular adminiatration of phenytOin ii not 
widely used because 111 ablmption ia erratic and umeliable, it crysta1Hzes at the 
htjection site, and it also produces local reactiona. 
Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin b fnely soluble in aqueous soludons and ii 
fonnulated in T1US buffer~ a pH of 8.6 to 9.0. PospbenytOiD ii raplclly and 
completely converted to phenytoin in vivo. J>ub.Davia developed fospben)'IOiD u an 
altcmative to parenteral pbmytoin bued on the ummption that ita fonnuladon 
without orpnic solvema at a lower pB would NIUlt in better iajecd.on· or lntulioa­
site tolerance ud fewer of tbe complicadoaa usociated with paremml pbeaytoiD 
administration. Tbe development propam focuaed on demoDatradna bloeqmvalence 
between fosphenytoiD and pbenytoin and tbe safety of foapbenytoin. Smee 
fospheaytoin is a pbenytoln pl0dna1 and no new tbenpeutic claim• are beia1 made 
beyond those already approved for puenteral phenytoin. proof-of-efficacy studlu 
were not conducted. ... 
2.3.3. Poteatial Cllnlcal ~

It is imperative to read IMPORT ANT NOTE on p. 3 before readina the followina. 
As stated ln the Introduction, the sponsor did not perform proof-of-efficacy studiel 
with fosphenytoin, and deaires that the drua be approved on the buis of bloequivalence with 
phenytoin. . 
Becallle phenytoin is hi1hly ( • 909' ) protein bound in vivo, free phenytoin is the 
specie of clinical importance. Studies 98220 and 98224 are croPOver studies comparing 
pluma free phenytoin concentrations followin1 IV administration of tosphenytoin and

13 One of the desired indictions for fosphenytoin is acute status epilipticus. Efficacy in 
this disorder is presumably mte to rapid attainment of high concentrations of plasma free 
phcnytoin. Therefore, free phenytoin AUC<o·TLDC> may not be a measure of relevant 
exposure, and the sponsor was requested to calculate, across the first 2 hours post-initiation 
of dosing, the ratio of cumulative free phenytoin AUC from fosphenytoin administration to 
that from phenytoin administration. At both the 100 an~ 150 mg/min infusion rates, the 909' 
confidence interval for Cumulative A UC falls within the 80 -125 9' range from about 30 
minutes onward. 
Studies 98220 and 98224 are the only investigations which attempt to show 
bioequivalence of free phcnytoin from fosphenytoin and Dilantin. They provide a scientific 
basis for dosing recommendations when maximal dose I infusion rate is desired ( eg. status 
epilepticus ) . 
Fospbenytoln Pbannacokinetics 
Plasma fosphenytoin concentrations increase with increasing dose and infusion rate 
and then decline with a terminal lm of approximately 0.2S hr independent of dose and 
infusion rate. 
Fosphenytoin clearance is dependent upon both dose and infusion rate. Fosphenytoin 
is highly bound to plasma albumin (approximately 95 9' bound at Cmax following high dose 
I high rate administration ), and the changes in clearance u•. hypothesized to be a result of 
nonlinear protein bindin1: as dose and infusion rate increase, higher plasma fosphenytoin 
concentrations are attained, protein binding saturates, more free fosphenytoin is available to 
be metabolized, and fosphenytoin clearance is enhanced. The figure below illustrates the 
changes in clearance observed with changes in dosing reaimen.

The effect of the above mentioned chanaes in clearance on the concentration-time 
profilt are not easily summarized. No structure exists which allows for the change in 
c!~c&11ce to be used to describe chanaes occuring "early" in the concentration·time profile. 
'llhat is meant by "early" is prior to the terminal linear phase of elimination. The sponsor 
has shown that concentration-dependent changes in clearance are accompanied by 
proportional chanaes in fosphenytoin volume of distribution during the terminal linear phase 
of metabolism ( Vct_ varies from 4.3L when 100 ma is infused at 3.3 m1 I min to 10.8 L 
when 1200 ma is infused at ISO ma I min). These Vd changes are consistent with a protein 
binding interaction model: as concentration increases free fraction increases and drug leaves 
plasma. The combination of increased clearance with increased Vd1111 result in a constant 
elimination t112• 
Independent of dose, route or rate of administration, fosphenyotin is a short lived 
specie. The total number of individuals receiving serial samplina in studies 98213, 14, lS, 
IS 16, 18, 20 and 24 was 124 ... 9f these 124 only 7 ( < 69') ht'd detectable fosphenytoin 
plasma concentrations at 5 or more hours post-initiation of administration. 
BasetJ upon equal AUC of total phenytoin from IV phenytoin and from fosphenytoin, 
it appears that conversion of fosphenytoin is t.ssentially complete. 
Special Populations 
A study with renal failure patients and hepaticalJy compromised padents was 
performed. Before examining the first table below (Table 3.), please note that the values 
listed for Cmax, AUC, Cl and Vd require adjustment --the values for Cmax and AUC can 
be determined by multiplying the table values by 0.753. The values for Cl and Vd can be 
determined by dividing the table values by 0. 753. The values for Tmax, lambda. and t
112 do 
not require adjustment. The second table below ( Table 7.) is for phcnytoin and no 
correction factor is required.

Using the corrected values, fosphenytoin clearance is more than 2-fold as great in 
cirrhosis patients and about 1.8 .. fold as great in renal failure patients than in healthy 
volunteers; however, it should be noted than the number of patients in :ach 1roup of this 
study is small. Bued on these data plasma concentration monitorin1 for patients with renal 
and hepatic disease is recommended in labeling. 
Visual inspection of fosphenytoin concentration-time profiles does not show 
differences acrosl 11.ae, gender, race or any other sub-group. This is consistent with tile fact 
that phosphatase activity is extensive and differences between individuals are likely to result 
in little or no difference in the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is consistent and essentially complete. 
There is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacokinetlcs due to differences in 
fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. 
17 Dn11 interactions ... 
Standard treatment for status epilepticus at many institutions includes concomitant 
administration of IV diuepam and IV phenytoin. Therefore, the sponsor performed a drug 
interaction study exarninina the effect of concomitant administration of fosphenytoin and 
diazepam on the phannacoldnetic profiles of fosphenytoin, diazepam and phenytoin derived 
from fosphenytoin. No differences in the kinetics of fosphenytoin, phenytoin or diaiepam 
occurred. However, the doses of fosphenytoin and diazepam used in the study were 
submaximal: 7SO mg of fosphcnytoin was administered, labeling is for up to 20 mg/kg ( 
1400 mg in a 70 kg individual ). Ten mg 'lf diazepam was administered, labeling is for 
doses up to 30 mg. Thus, conditions likely to show an interaction ( maximium dose of both 
agents) were not examined. 
The metabolism of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is accomplished by phosphatases. Since 
phosphatases are acnerally not responsible for xenobiotic dru1 metabolism, phannacokinetic 
drug interactions between fosphenytoin and agents which are not phosphate pro-dru1s are 
unlikely. Given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases, it is unlikely that drug 
interactions between fosrhenytoin and other phosphataseMconverted pro-drugs would be 
signifiwnt. 
IM administration 
Because phenytoin is not usually administered IM, fosphenytoin IM wu compared to 
phenytoin PO and phenytoin IV. 
A verqe absolute bioavailability of phenytoin derived from a maintenance dose ( 2SO 
mg) of IM fosphcnytoin administered to healthy volunteers is 101" ( Study 98206 ). 
In epilepsy patients being maintained on PO Dilantin, substitution of equimolar IM 
fosphenytoin for PO Dilantin results in an increase in Cmax,,. , ... ..,,.. ( 38~ ), AUC,,. .~mytoin 
( 24~ ), and trough,..,._,.. ( 169' ) ( study 98213 ). This observed increase in Cmax may 
be due to differences in dosing frequency: PO Dilantin was administered QID while IM 
fosphenytoi· ·vas aiven .QD. 
Formulation 
Only one fosphenytoin formulation ( the to-be-marketed formulation ) was studied 
clinically.

• R~ponse to EIRs ldentlned In 483 Forms ... 
Following site inspections for the 98214, 98218 and 98224 studies, the Division of 
Scientific Investigations issu!d multiple Form 483 to Parke-Davis. A review of the EIRs 
detailed in these 483 is provided as Appendix S. We find that two of the BIRs need be 
addressed. The first is identified as 1. in Appendix 5 and is reproduced below. 
1. Reported toaphenytoin concentrations ware in error since 
the water content of the f osphenytoin reference standard 
was not taken into account in calculations. 
The water content of the fosphenytoin sodium reference material 
was reported to be 22.st. The salt form r~prasented only 77.5' 
of the waiqht of the undried powder. The firm did not dry the 
powder on the qrounds that the material was unstable with respect 
to heat. Therefore, the reported concentrations of tosphenytoin 
in plasma are in error, and need to be corrected. Similarly, 
some of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters tor fosphenytoin 
(Cmax, AUC, CL, Vd) require correction. 
In response to the identification of this deficiency, Parke-Davis audited the NDA to 
determine if errors in the calculation of fosphenytoin concentrations occured in studies other 
than 98214, 98218 and 98224. A portion of their conclusions is presented on the following 
page. 
10 .... 
Parke Davu-gtMrat1d ltlllliu 
As noted in the October 19, 199S, submission, fospbenytoin concentrations and 
estimates of fosphenytoin Cmax, AUC, CL and Vd in clinical trials conducted by 
Parke-Davis may be corrected by applying a correction factor of O. 753. Fosphenytoin 
free fraction, tmax, elimination rate and half life estimates are unaffected as their 
estimation ·d~ not depend on the absolute value of concentrations used in their 
derivation. Therefore, parameters documenting the rate of fosphcnytoin conversion to 
phenytoin are not affected. Further, phenytoin and free phenytoin conccnttatiom, 
whether derived from Dilantin or fosphenytoin, are unaffected and thus the 
biocquivalt:ncy of fosphenytoin and phenytoin as presented in tbe pending NDA are not 
affec!ed. 
Jenerated studies 
Our submission of October 19, 1995. indicated mat we were attempting to detcnnine if 
the fosphenytoin concentrations reponed in the initial studies 1enerated by 
were also in enor. We have since determined that these concentrations in the 
clinical studies are most likely in error. We have determined the lot number and water 
content of fosphenytoin reference standard used in Protocola 982-007 (renal and hepatic 
disease) and 982-011 (diaz.epam interaction). Our ftndinas indicate that it is likely that 
fospht!nytoin concentrations and parameters in these reports can be corrected by 
applying the same correction factor used in Parke-Davis atudlea. Since these reports 
were prepared by _ we bave not modified the original reports, but have added 
appropriate information to the cover page. Lot numbers, and thus the water content, of 
fosphenytoin reference staod.arda used in other studies cannot be unequivocally 
determined at this time. We have also added information identifying this potential 
problem to tbe cover pages of these reports. These early studies document phenytoin 
pharmacokinotica followq low fospbenytoin doses (Studies 982 .. 1,3), the absolute 
bioavailability of pbenytoin following intravenous and intramuscular fosphenytoin 
dosma (Studies 982-2.5,6,10), the effects of hepatic and renal imuftlcieocy on 
fospbenytOin conversion to pbenytoin (Study 982-7), aod a diuepam·pb.enytoin drug­
drug interaction study followina fospbenytoin administration ($tudy 982-11). These 
studies are intended to address questions of rate and extent of fospheaytOin coavenion 
to phenytoiD. Parameters used to reflect these processes (fospbenytoin half-life and 
phenytoin AUC, Cmax, and tmax) are unaffected. Therefore, the conclusiona from 
these studies are not affected by our inability to accurately modify the fospbenytoin 
concentrations in these early studies. 
2.1 . The errors in fosphenytoin concentrations have NOT been accounted for in the 
mdivid~ study repons ( Apptddix 2 ). The values have little bearina on the interpretation 
of machos~- the specie of clinical intereat is 1enerally plasma phenytoin, not pluma 
fosphenytom. 
The second BIR of significance is identified~ 3. in Appendix 5 and is reproduced 
below. · 
3. Failure to uae th• appropriate matrix to prapara QC 
samples tor validating atabilitI in storaga and raliabilitJ of the ultratiltrat on step (a••aya ot fr•• 
phenytoin in plasma ultratiltrata) and tor validating stability in frozen urine. 
The assay tor phanytoin in sample plasma ultratiltrate included 
the tollowinq stages: frozen storage, thawin;, possible 
retreezin9 and rathawin9, ultrafiltration, dilution, extraction, 
and chromatography. In th• case of the QC samples, used both tor 
validating atability in storage and monitorin; daily performance ot the assay, the ataqaa of frozen atorage, thawing, and 
freeze/thaw cycles were conducted after ultratiltration, out ot 
the sequence for study samples. Thua, the po••ibiliti•• that 
phanytoin stability was dittar•nt in PUF v•. pla•ma, that the 
binding protein• were un•table, and that th• bindinq equilibria 
between tree and protein-bound phenytoin diaproportionated durin9 
frozen atoraqe, thawing, or freeze/thaw cycle•, were not 
investigated. The recovery ot tr•• phenytoin during the ultratiltration •tag• waa not ••tabliahed. The within-day and 
oatween-day variability of the ultratiltration ataqe was not 
considered. The reproducibility of the ultratiltration stage was 
not monitored during the assay of subject aamplea, becauae 
plasma-based QC aampl•• were not ultraf iltered with each run. 
QC aampl•• for the aaaay of phenytoin in PUF •hould have been 
prepared in fre•h whole p!a•ma. Th• firm replied that phenytoin stability in whole plaama wa~ demonstrated, and contended that this established stability ot phenytoin meaaured in PUF. The 
conaider•tion• outlined in the ,reviou• para9raph (dittarancaa in -
•tability, atability of bindinq proteins, disproportionation, 
reoov1ry, ultratiltration variability) were not addr••••d. There is literature evidence that pluma proteins do not dearade with multiple 
freei.e/thaw cycles, and thereii also litenture evidence that plasma phenytoin can be 1.tored 
frozen for len1thy periods of dme without de1radadon of phenytoin. The NDA provides 
evidence that fosphenytoin is stable when stored frozen in plaama. However. because of the 
improper handlin& of the standards, we cannot cateaorically rule out the possibility that 
differences in stability of fosphenytoin, phenytoin atld/or bindin1 proteins, did occur between 
the samples usayed in studies 98214, 98218 and 98224. We believe that such differences 
likely did not occur, but this belief is not based upon empirical eviclmc:e from the studies 
themselves.

coagulant in this study. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No adverse experiences were reported at the 300 and 600 mg dose. Minor 
CNS adverse reactions including lightheadedness, headache and nystagmus were reported at the 
600 and 1200 mg doses. None of the subjects prematurely discontinued the study. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The phannacokinetic results are summarized in Table 1 
below. Fosphenyioin was rapidly converted to phenytoin with a half·life of approximately 7. 7 
minutes. Fosphenytoin appeared to display linear kinetics in this concentration range. This 
result is consistent with later studies because the highest dosage in this study ( 1200 mg 
fosphenytoin at a rate of 40 mg.lrnin • 800 mg phenytoin equivalents at a rate of 27 mglmL) is 
lower than the dosages at which nonlinearities have been observed. Phenytoin kinetics were 
consistent with those previously reported. Thus, at the relatively low doses used in this study it 
does not appear that fo~phenytoin has a large effect on phenytoin phannacokinetics. Subtle 
changes in phenytoin ph~acokinetics would not have been detected in this type of study. 
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy volunteers, fosphenytoin is safely administered at the highest level 
studied (1200 mg given over 30 minutes). It is rapidly converted to phenytoin.

RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00025 
STUDY DESIGN: This wu a randomized, open-label, two treatment crossover. The 2SO mg 
phenytoin and 37S mg fosphenytoin doses were administered by iv infusions over 30 minutes. 
Twenty six blood samples were obtained per treatment up to 120 hours after drug infusion. Total 
drug concentration in the pluma was measured at all time points, total concentration in the blood 
wu measured at six of the collection times points, and unbound concentration in the plasma wu 
measured at two time points (at the end of the infusion and 30 minutes after the end of the 
infusion ). Treatments were separated by two weeks. 
SUBJECTS: Healthy male volunteers ( n•l2 ). 
DOSAGE FORM: See Formulation Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix. 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study, and the temperature at which ultrafiltration was performed is not clear 
ftom the study report. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions were observed in this study. Fosphenytoin 
injection caused less injection site irritation than did phenytoin injection. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The bioavailability of phenytoin after iv fosphenytoin 
administration compared to after iv phenytoin administration was 99.20/o = 0.031 (because of the 
low variability the two dosages are actually bioequivalent in terms of AUC~ Table 3 ). The 
concentration time profiles were similar but not superimposable at early time points ( Figure 1 ). 
The unbound fraction of phenytoin was highest immediately after the fosphenytoin infusion ( 
Table 1, this result is consistent with fosphenytoin displacing phenytoin trom pluma proteins. 
The effect is quite small because of tho relatively small fosphenytoin dose used in this study ). 
The blood to plasma ratio for fosphenytoin wu approximately O.S for S of the six time points 
measured ( Table 2 ). At the latest time point ( 3 hr ) the ratio increased to approximately 2. 
Thia unexpected result ia likely due to analytical erron caused by the very low fosphenytoin 
concentrations at this time point. AJ described in the analytical section above, the results of this 
part of the study are in question due to the use of heparin as the anticoaaulant. 
Bioavailability would have been better detennincd by a comparison of unbound AUCs 
instead of total AUCs. This is because bioavailability calculations are bued on the aasumption 
that clearance does not differ in the two treatments that are being compared. In thia case, 
fosphenytoin can displace phenytoin &om pluma proteins thereby increasing ft.a and total 
phenytoin clearance. Unbound clearance would not have been affected by this phenomenon and 
thus unbound AUC comparison would have been a better measure ofbioavailability. However, 
because fosphenytoin is relatively short-lived in the pluma, and because the fu of phenytoin wu 
only increased by approximately 1 % due to foaphenytoin this etfect should have had only a very 
s., small influence on phenytoin At:.rC. The fact that the phenytoin concentration/time profiles were 
very similar for most of the time period also helps support the validity of the bioavailability 
conclusions made in this study. 
CONCLUSIONS: Fosphenytoin is completely converted to phenytoin after intravenous 
administration. Fosphenytoin does not significantly distribute into red blood cells.

at 37° C in Study 98213. 
SAFETY RESULTS: 982M --Parenteral fosphenytoin was well tolerated by the 
patients. No clini~\y sipiftcant chan1ea in blood presabre, heart rate, reapL"ltion, 
ne·Jrolopcal status (except nystaamua ), and the electrocardiogram were observect following 
either IM or IV treatment. · · 
98213 -There were no clinically sipiftcant dlfferences in the 
type and frequency of adverse events between fosphenytoin·and Dilandn treatment aroups, 
and the adverse event profile was similar to that expected with· phenytoin therapy. PHARMACOKINBTIC ~tJLTS: 98205 ( sin1le dose fosphenytoin) -The data 
are presented on the followina 3 pages (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1 ), and show that, u 
expected, IV adminisuation produces a steeper rise in the concentration time profile than IM 
administration. 
98213 ( multiple dose fosphenytoin) --The data 
are presented on ppAI-'~ Fiaurc 3, Table 2 ). For at least the first 4 hrs post­
administration, free concentrations of phenytoin followina IM fosphenytoin administration are 
considerably peater than those followina PO Dilantin administration ( Fiaurc 3 ). This is 
consistent with a protein bindin1 interaction: when fosphenytoin is present phenytoin ii 
displaced and free phenytoin concentrations increase. It is also consistent with the total 
phenytoin data: total phenytoin is more bioavallable from IM fosphenytoin than from PO 
Dllantin ( Fiaure 3, Table 2 ). This inctt.ae in total phenytoin concentrati~s results in the 
increased free phenytoin concentrations noted.

increase in Cmaxrn.,..,,. ( 389') and AUC, .... ,...,.._ ( 24~ ) (study 98213 ). The increase 
in Cmax may be due to differences in dosing frequency: PO Dilantin was administered QID 
while IM fosphenytoin was 1iven QD. 
The eff~t of substitution of IV fosphenytoin for PO Dilantin on Cmax of free 
phenytoin can be inferred. IM administration of fosphenytoin results in higher Cnw,b••• 
than PO administration of phcnytoin, and IV administration of fosphenytoin results in higher 
Cmax, .. .,.. than IM administration of fosphenytoin. Thus, IV administration of fosphenytoin 
is likely produces an even greater increase in C~ than does IM administration of 
fosphenytoin. This increase in Cmax, ... .,... would be expected to result in an increase in 
Cmax,_ ,111.._. Also, IV administration results in greater Cmax,0.,b,.,... than does IM 
administration. Based upon this increased piasma fosphenytoin causing displacement of

healthy male volunteers 
STUDY NUMBER: 982-06 (9653-86-06) 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00028 
STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, open-label, two treatment crossover. Fosphenytoin ( 
2SO mg ) was injected into the gluteus maximus muscle over approximately 30 seconds. Six 
volunteers received 2 simultaneous 2.5 mL injections and 6 volunteen received a single S mL 
injection. Phenytoin ( 250 mg ) was administered via an iv infusion over 10 minutes. Twenty six 
blood sunples were obtained per treatment up to 120 hours after drug infusion. Only total 
fosphenytoin and phenytoin concentrations in the plasma was measured. Treatments were 
separated by two weeks. 
SUBJECTS: Healthy male volunteers (n=l2}. 
DOSAGE FORM: See Fonnulation Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions were observed in this study. IM: fosphenytoin 
injection caused less injection site irritation than did IV phenytoin injection. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The phannacokinetii: results ofthis study are summarized 
in Tables 1 -3. The plasma concentration time curves for phenytcin and fosphenytoin are given 
in Figures I -3. The elimination half-life for fosphenytoin after IM injection averaged 44 
minutes (Table 1 ), considerably longer that the 15 minute half-life typically observed after IV 
fosphenytoin injection. This result suggests that flip-flop kinetics are occurring (i.e. tenninal 
rate reflects absorption from muscle tissue ). The Cmax was higher and the Tmax was earlier 
when the dose wu administered by 2 IM injections compared to a single IM injection ( Table 3 
). 
The bioavailability of phenytoin ftom IM fosphenytoin (compared to IV phenytoin) was 
101.2 :1: 1.6% (Table 2 ). Bioavailability was not affected by whether the drug was given as one 
or two injections, although the rate of absorption was faster after two injections ( Table 3 ). Not 
surprisinaly, phenytoin Cmax wu lower and the Tmax was later after IM fosphenytoin injection 
compared to IV phenytoin infusion (Table 2, Figure 2 ). 
CONCLUSION: Fosphenytoin is completely converted to phenytoin after intramuscular 
injection. Fosphenytoin absorption from muscle is fairly smooth and appears to follow simple 
first order kinetics with a half-life of approximately 0.75 hr. Thus, IM fosphenytoin appears to 
be a reasonable form of maintenance therapy.

coagulant in this study. 
PROTOCOL VARIATIONS: Volunteers' #1 ( healthy ) and 12 ( healthy ) pluma sample 
e>..tracts were incorrectly processt-d and therefore omilted. Volunteer '1 (renal failure) was 
also omitted due to •chromatographiC interferences•. Volunteer 113 rece.\ved only a 24 
minute infusion, and wu therefore not included in Cmax or Tmax analy1e1. Volunteers 114 ( 
hepatic), #12 (renal ), #13 (renal ), and #14 (renal ), received modified, or no, treatment 
with their ongoing concomitant therapies. 
SAFBTY RESULTS: No adverse clinical events were reported and no clinically qnificw1t 
changes were observed in the physical examinations, clinical laboratory parameters, clinical 
observations, or electrocardioarams. 
PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Demographic information was sunnarized for each g':"Oup 
(renal, hepatic, and hepatic) 11p1r1tely. Differences among 
groups were assessed using a one·w~y ANOVA llOdtl for 
continuous data and Fisher's Exact Text for categorical 
data. ... 
Maximum p16311a concentration (Cmax> and the time of the 
•aximum plas•a concentration (Tmax) were determined by 
observation. 
The terminal or •apparent" disposition rate constant (~n) 
was calculated as the slept of the terminal portion of the 
log-linear plasma concentration versus time curve.

82 Bast.d on the null hypothesis of no diff~ncc between groups, statistical significance ( 
p < O.OS ) is not reached in nearly all of the comparisons made above. However, the null 
hypothesis of no difference is inappropriate as differences would be expected based upon the 
protein binding nature of the drug and decreases in plasma protein which accompany renal 
and hepatic diseases. The study is insufficiently powered ( 3 - 4 in each group ) to allow for 
the chosen statistical approach to be utilized, and trends. are clearly obsr.:ivable. 
CONCLUSIONS: The dose of fosphcnytoin administered in this study was 250 mg 
phenytoin equivalents at 8.33 mg equivalents I min.. The sponsor has labeled the drug for 
administration at doses as large as 20 mg/kg at ISO mg/min. Clearly, the study fails to 
encompass the condition where changes in drug disposition are most easily obJCrved and 
most clinically serious: following high do.:1e and rate of administtation. Further, free 
phenytoin concentrations were not measured in the study. Since free phenytoin is the specie 
of interest, and serum protein concentrations are altered by renal and hepatic disease (as 
would be expected these alterations were seen in the current study --see Table on p. ), 
this severely limits the ability to interpret th~ effect of renal and hepatic disease on the 
disposition of free phenytoin from fosphcnytoin. 
Fosphenytoin clearance is more than 2-fold greater in cirrhosis patients than in healthy 
volunteers, and over 1.S-fold greater in renal failure patients. STUDY: Absolute bioavailability ofphenytojn from CI-982 jn patients with thcrapet1tjc scrum b . . .... bl . b . p enytom concentcat1ons usm1 sta e 1sgtgpe tee mgues

STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, open-label study in epileptic patients on chronic oral 
phenytoin monotherapy. At separate injection sites in the same arm., each patient received 128 
ms phenytoin equivalents of labelled fosphenytoin and 130 mg phenytoin equivalents of labelled 
phenytoin sin. ultaneously. Blood was sampled at 2S time points up to 96 hours after drug 
administration. Urine wu collected ju5t prior to the infusions and from 0 .. 1, 1 -24, 24 .. 48, 48 
-72 and 72 -96 hours. Labelled and unlabeled phenytoin and fosphenytoin concentrations were 
measured in the plasma and urine via satisfactory HPLC and GC1MS methodologies. The 
phenytoin metabolite S-( 4-hydroxyphenyl)-S-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) wu also measured in 
the urine. 
SUBJECTS: Epileptic males on chronic oral phenytoin monotherapy (n-6). 
DOSAGE FORM: nc-labelled fosphenytoin disodium (229.4 mg/3.2 ml.., Lot #Z88-S-S) and 
1'N.l>c labelled phenytoin sodium (189.9 mg/3.2 mL. Lot #Z88-5·5). see also Fonnulation 
Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin wu used u an anti­
coagulant in this study. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions were observed in this study. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The phannacokinetic results of this study are summarized 
in Tables 1 -2. The phannacokinetic parameters determined l". these patienu are very consistent 
with what was found in healthy volunt~. The AUC ratio of 13C-phenytoin/1'N-13C-phenytoin 
(i.e. AUC of phenytoin ftom fosphenytoin injection divided by AUC of phenytoin ftom 
phenytoin injection) wu 0.96 with a 95% confidence interval for bioequivalence being 0.92 to 
1.00. Thus, the bioavailability offosphenytoin is vinually unity. 
No fosphenytoin was detected in the urine. However, sllahtly more phenytoin wu 
detected in the urine durin1 the tint 1 hour after fosphenytoin administration compared to after 
phenytoin administration (Table 3 ). This indicates that it is possible that a very small amount 
\lf fosphenytoin ( approximately 1 Yo of the dose ) may be excreted in the urine, where it is 
subsequently hydrolyzed to phenytoin. The recovery of p-HPPH wu higher after phenytoin 
administration than after fosphenytoin administration (Table 2 ), but this difference wu small 
and not statistically sianificart. 
CONCLUSION: This wu an excellent method for detenrainina bioavailability because 
intruubject variability wu completely eliminQted. An intravenous dose of fosphenytoin WaM 
virtually completely converted to phenytoin in patients who were on chronic oral phenytoin 
therapy.

DOSAGE FORM: see Formulation Summary: Appendix 3 
ASSAY: see Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. Free fractions were determined by spiking with radiolabel and 
ultracentrifugation wu perfonned at room temperature. 
PROTOCOL VARIATIONS: There were n..> protocol variations. There were 2 dropouts. 
Subject #6 withdrew from the study after completing his first treatmerAt ( treatment B -­
diazeparn and fosphenytoin ) following diagnosis of underlying borderline hypertension by 
hispersonal physician. Subject 110 was withdrawn from the study after panicipating in 
as tteatments B and A ( treatAtll\t B -diazepam and fosphenytoin and treatment A -­
fosphenytoin alone) because of a vaso·1agal episode during treatment A. Subjects 6 and 10 
were included in the safety analysis but not in PK analysis. 
SAFETY RESULTS: One subject ( 110) experienced a vasovagal syncopal episode which 
included hypotension and bradycardia during Treatmen~ A ( fosphenytoin alone ) . These 
events required discontinuation of the study drug. This subject had previously completed 
treatment B ( diazepam and fosphenytoin ) without significant effects on heart rate, ECG 
intervals, or blood pressure. Follow-up evaluation of this episode, which included a 24 hour 
Holter monitor recordina and a more extensive medical history, revealed no cardiologic 
abnormalities, but did detail a previously unreponed episode of syncope during an 
intravenous drua study. In the investigator's clinical judgement, dtis episode was therefore 
related to tbe intravenous infusion but not to fosphenytoin. Ten of the 11 subjects who 
entered the study reported adverse clinical events in at least one treatment phase. These 
events are summari7.ed below.

OBJECTIYES To 1valu1te, in healthy subjects, the safety and tolerance 
of 11c1l1t1ng single dos11 and tnfuston r1t11 of 1ntr1v1nously (IV) 
adm1n1st1r1d fosph1nyto1n compared with placebo and to d1fin1 the

DRUG TREATMENT Fo11ow1ng a r1ndom1ztd, four-way crossover d111,n. subjects r1c1tv1d stn9l1 IV infusion do111 of fo1ph1nytoin or p acebo at wttkly 1nttrvals. Thi first group r1c11v1d 100, 1200, or 1100 mg 
fosphtnyto1n at 11.75 mg/min (1quiv1l1nt to 400, 800, or 1200 mg 
phtnyto1n at 12.5 mg ph1nytotn/mtn) or placebo (td1nt1ca1 volume of 
fosphtnytotn vehicle adM1n11t1r1d at th1 111111 r1t1 11 the fosph1nyto1n 
dos•)~ Sub11qu1nt groups r1c11v1d th111 11111 do111 of fosph1nytotn and 
placebo at 37.5, 75, 190, and 225 mg/mtn (1qutv1l1nt to 25, 50, 100, and 
150 mg ph1nytotn/mtn). Escalation to the next do11 and/or 1nfus1on rate 
was contingent on th1 1b11nc1 of significant adverse events at the previous dost or rate. 
~UBJECI CHARACT£BISTICS AND DISPOSJIIQN Twenty-one men ran,ing tn 191 
from 11 to 43 years (1111n ZI) p1rt1c1p1ted tn this study. wenty subjects compl1t1d the study; one subject withdrew for personal re1son1. 
PHARMACOKINETIC~ In 91n1ral. fo1phen1totn plasma concentr1tton1 
1ncr1111d wltho11 and tnfu11on rate, p11k1d near th• end of infusion, 
and then d1cltn1d wtth a t~ of approxtmat1ly 0.25 hour. Mean 
fosph1nytotn AUC(O· .. ) values d1cr1111d with tncr1111ng infusion r1t1; 
but 1ncr1111d with tncr1111ng dost, 1lthou9h less than expected fot a 
drug with ltn11r ph1n11coktn1ttc1. When higher pl11111 fo1ph1nyto1n 
conc1ntratton1 w1r1 1cht1v1d wtth incr111ing infusion rat11, more fr•• 
fosph1nytotn was 1v1il1bl1 for conversion to phenytoin rtsulttn; 1n 
1ncr1111d fosphenytotn clearance. 
Total ph1nyto1n and fr11 phenytotn ph1rm1coktn1t1cs were nonlinear. 
M11n total ph1nytoin Cmax valu11 tncr1111d 1pproxt11t1ly proportionally 
with tncr11111 tn do11. AUC(O-.. ) valu11 tncr1111d at a gr11t1r than

five-fold over the three-fold range of dosos. Whilt Cmax and AUC(O-.,) 
values increased with dosa, they did not increase with increased rates, 
providing further evidence that extent of fosphenytotn conversion to 
phanytoin was 1ndep1ndent of fosphtnytotn ~nfus1on rate. 
Fosph1nytoin displaced phenytoin from plasma protein b1nd1ng sites 
result1ng 1n a phenytoin fr11 fract1~n that 1ncr1111d with increasing 
plasma fosphenytoin conctntr1tton. D1spl1c1m1nt waJ greatest after 
adm1n1strat1on of 1200 mg ph1nytoin aqu1vtlents fosph1nytotn, leading to 
increases in ~~anyto1n free fraction during tht first hour after the 
start of 1nfus1on. During th• ftrst hour, stmtl1r frtt phenyto1n Cmax 
values were seen 1t 12.5 to 50 mg ph1nytoin tqu1\~lents/mtn, whereas 
higher free ph1nyto1n Cmax values t1mporally related to tncr1a11d frte 
fraction were observed at 100 and 150 119 phtnytotn 1quiv1l1nts/m1n. 
Following convers1on of fo1ph1nytotn to phenyto1n, fr11 fraction, and 
plasma free phenyto1n concentrattons w1r1 s1m11tr at all 1nfus1on rates. 
Frte phenyto1n conc1ntr1tton-tim1 profiles after adm1ntstrat1on of 
1200 ~ phtnytotn 1qu1va11nts fo1ph1nytoin at tht two highest rates w1r1 
similar to those histor1cally observed following admtn1strat1on of 
1200 mg D11ant1n at 50 mg/min. 
Renal ph1nyto1n and fr11 ph1nyto1n cl11r1nc11 were independent of do11 
and 1nfuston rate. L111 than 2% of do11 w11 1xcr1t1d as phenyto:u. 
Thus, transient alt1rattons 1n ph1nytoin free fraction d1d not affect 
overall renal cl11ranc1 of phenytotn. 
SAFETY Overall, 881 of fosph1nytotn-tre1t1d subjects 1xp1ri1nc1d 
1dv1rs1 1v1nts compared with 151 of p11c1bo-tr11t1d subjects. A total 
of 220 adverse 1v1nt1 occurr1d fallowing fosph1nytotn treatm1nt; most 
w1r1 mild in int1nsity and attributed to drug tr11t11nt. In general, 
the ov1r111 frequency of 1dvtr11 1v1nt1 1ncr1111d wtth fos~henyto1n

L t. :.:_ The above fi1ures de~strate that, at the 150 ma/min rate of fosphenytoin, AUC oi 
free phenytoin from fosphenytoin reaches that of free phenytcin from Dilantin at 
approximately 8 min. post-stan-of~infusion., rises above that of Dilantin, and then falls to be 
approximately equal to that of Dilantin within 30 minutes post-stan-of·infusion. This 
approximate equality :s then maintained over the remainder of the time course. At 100 
mg/min fosphenytoin, cumulative AUC of free phenytoin takes approximately 1.S hrs. to 
reach the 80 -125 9' band. · 
As forementioned, the cumulative AUC from fosphenytoin is areater tha1a that from 
Dilantin for approximately 10 • 20 minutes. However, examination of the concentration-time 
profiles ( Panel D -paae I rl) shows that the reason for the increased A UC is because 
fosphenytoin delivers free phenytoin more rapidly than Dilantin, and not because Cmax is 
increued. An additional point is that the differences in cumulative AUC between the 100 
and 1~0 ma rates is due to the first 15 minutes post-initiation-of-infusion. From that point 
onward, the differences between the 100 and 150 ma/min infusion rates are minimal. 
These analysis' show that, at 100 -l~O ma/min, free phenytoin from fosphenytoin 
closely approximates, but does not duplicate, free phenytoin from Dilantin at SO mg/min. 
CONCLUSIONS: The concentration-time profile of free phenytoin from 1200 ma of 
fosphenytoin administered at 100 or lSO mg/min is comparable to that followina 1200 m1 of 
phenytoin administered at SO m1/min. The ISO ma/min rate meets equivalence criteria for 
Cmax and AUC, whereas the 100 ma/min rate meets criteria for AUC only. 
If cumulative AUC is examined, the 1.50 ma/min rate meets equivalence criteria from 
30 minutes onward, the 100 ma/min rate from 90 minutes onward. At time periods lonaer 
than 90 minutes the AUC of free phenytoin from fosphenytoin at either administration rate 
are equivalent to free phenytoin from SO ma/min Dilantin. 
i31 STUDY: Pharmacolcinetic meta analysis of fosphenytoin clinical trills •• .. . 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR-X 764,02114 
OBJECTIVE: To compare systemic exposure of phenytoin, 1) after dosing fosphcnytoin and 
Dilantin•. 2) between patienu and healthy subjects, 3) between arterial and venous phenytoin, 
and 4) the effects of age. aender, and race on the pharmacokinetic profile of fosphenytoin. 
STUDY DE.SIGN: The data from clinical studies 982-13 to 982-16 and healthy volunteer 
studies 982-18, 982·20 and 982-24 were utilized. 
l) Phenytoin population pharmacokinetics wu carried out usina a nonlinear mixed effect 
model to evaluate the effects of dosina re1imen, body weiaht, time, qe, acnder, and serum 
albumin concentration on phenytoin clearance and distribution in a linear pharmacokinetic 
model. The studies 982·14 and 982-lS used in the analysis were from routine therapeutic 
drua monitorina. Only samples collected more than 6 houn after fosphenytoin administration 
were used (to avoid crou reactivity with immunoassay). 
2) Oraphical analysis of patient/subject differences were made by subsettina free phenytoin, 
total phenytoin and fosphenytoin concentration time profiles by dose and infusion rate and 
visually inspectina for patterns and/or differences amona patients and healthy subjects. All 
the above studies were included. 
3) Comparison of arterial and venous pluma concentrations for fosphenytoin, total phenytOin 
and free phenytoin were made in 6 neurosurgery patients. Plots were visually inspected for 
trends. 
4) Patient sub-populations were 1raphically analyzed by subsettin1 plasma concentration 
profiles by route of administration and then further subsettin1 by aae, 1ender, and race and 
visually inspectina for patterns and/or differences amona patients. -
RESULTS: 
1) A linear pharmacokinetic model served u a suitable alternative to the aenerally applicable 
non-linear model 1iven the restrictions in the range of doses and plasma phenytoin 
concentrations available from these clinical trials. 
Consistent with previous clinical experience, phenytoin clearance and volume of 
distribution exhibit a direct relationship with wei&ht. Mean trouah phenytoin levels decline 
over time (Fi& 1) and this is 1190 reflected in the individual plots (Fi& 2). Modelin1 sugests 
this decline in mean plasma phenytoin concentration is most likely explained in terms of an 
increase in phenyta.\n clearance in those patients remainina in the studies for more than just a 
few day• rather ttwl a tendency for patients with intrinsically hi1h clearance to remain in the 
study loncer (Pi& 2 and Bayes estimates). 
Modellna ror difference in extent of systemic availability suacsts that fosphenytoin 
delivers 15" less phenytoin than Dllantin, however, this may be due to model 
misspeciftcation of the i.m. dosaae. · 
2) Graphical presentation of free phenytoin, total phenytoin, and fosphenytoin concentration .. 
time proftles by dose/infusion rate does not sugest the presence of sub .. populations or 
specific individuals for which these levels are acypicai. 
3) Graphical comparison of plasma anerial and venous concentration time profiles for free 
phenytoin, total phenytoin and fosphenytoin d-\) not show any differences. 
I 3.l. ... 4) Graphical analysis of patient sub-populations did not suagest the presence of 
sub-populations or specific individuals for which fosphcnytoin concentration time profiles 
were atypical (Fi& 3). 
CONCLUSIONS: The observed trend for concentrations to drop within individuals su11esu 
a time dependent increase in clearance in phenytoirt clearance which has been observed 
previously in febrile patients and trauma patients. This docs not appear to be related to 
fosphenytoin administration. The observation that intravenous fosphenytoin is 15 9' less 
bioavailable than Dilantin is not of concern because the improved flt of the data to the model 
includina this bioavailability term is moderate. No fun.her unusual trends where observed. 
Visual inspection of plasma arterial and venous concentration-time profiles for 
fosphenytoin show no obvious differences which is consistent with the fact that phenytoin ia a 
low extraction ratio drua. 
Visual inspection of fosphenytoin concentration time profiles does not show any 
apparent differences across aae, sender, race or in any of the sub-groups. This is consistent 
with the fact that phosphatase activity is extensive and differences in individuals is unlikely to 
make much difference in the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is consistent and essentially complete. 
There is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacokinetics due to differences in 
fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. RR·X 764-02114 28

STUDY: Characterization gffosphenytgjn and phcn)1ojn hyman plasma protein bindina in yitro 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR. 764-02124 
OBJECTIVES· To detennine the protein bindin1 characteristics offoaphenytoin and phenytoin 
u1in1 1tandard in vitro methodologies. 
STUDY DESIGN: Pluma wnplea were spiked with foaphenyt<'in ( up to 800 ~i/mL ) and 
phenytoin ( up to 80 µWmL ) and total and unbound drua concen~tationa were detenninld via 
ultraftltration and HPLC. NONMEM wu used to fit the data to a ''ariety ofblndina modela. 
RESULTS: The followina pertinent conclusions can be made (see Fiaures 1 -s ): 
l. Foaphenytoin bindina is beat described by a model which incorporates 2 aaturable bindina 
sites. Fosphenytoin binds to the site ofhipest affinity with a bil"~;na constant of approximately 
1. 1 µa/mL, auu•tin1 that thia ia the approximate unbound pluma concentration above which 
nonlinear bindina may be obMl'Yld. The aecond lite hu a much low• aftlnity ( Kd > 100 µa/mL 
) 1u11eatln1 that blndln1 at thla lite will be linear at typical in vivo pluma foaphenytoin 
con centration1. 
2. Phenytoin bindina is bat duoribtd by a model which inGorporat• I saturable bindina site 
and 1 linear bindin1 1ite. The afftnity constant for the uturable bindina lite i1 approximately 30 
µwmL. 
3. Fosphenytoin ( at he eoncentrations above •!'proximately l. O µJlmL or total concentrations 
above approximately 75 µa/mL ) is capable or displacina phenytoin &om the high affinity 
bindina 1iaht1 whereu phtnytoin ( at total concentradona below 80 "8/mL ) doea not 
sipitlcantly displace fosphenytoin. 
4. These reaulta are qualitatively conaiatent with the multi ofln vivo nudl•. However, 
quantitatively ~ are 10me incollliltmci• .. TheH inconaiatencin are likely due to 
dtflcitneiu in the in vivo nudiu ( ~ludin1 the performance of ultrafUtration at non­
phyaioloaical temperatures, the UM of hepann u the anticoqulant, and the uae of contaminated 
radlolabeled drup ). RR 764-02124 30

Insufficient information is provided regarding the test 
methods for water solubility and partition coefficient. 
DEFICXENT. For water solubility information such as the 
methodology used (e.g., undersaturation/oversaturation), the 
study site, the temperature at which the soluhility was 
determined and the HPLC method should be provided. For the partition cocf f icient information such as the test 
methodology, the study site, concentration at which the 
study was performed (?. different ones needed) and the HPLC 
method should be provided. 
Although not necessary, the photolytic degradation of 
Fosphenytoin Sodium was determined. The conclusion (page 
17, 1st sentence in second paragraph) should be revised to 
indicate that photolysis is not a primary removal mechanism 
of Fosphenytoin Sodium from the environment. DZPICIBNT. 
Fosphenytoin Sodium is aerobically biodegraded in the 
aquatic·compartment to Phenytoin. Phenytoin does not 
biodegrade in the aquatic compartment and does not to absorb 
to soil. The company states that Hydroxyphenytoin 
aerobically biodegrades rapidly in the aquatic compartment 
and that it has been proven/demonstrated to completely 
degrade to C03• The data provided does not support these 
statements. DBPICIBNT. (See Attachments 4 and 5)

REMARKS/COMMENTS: JUN - 7 1995 
Phenytoin starting material is synthesized under OM• . which is currently under review and 
contains some major deficiencies. In general, the deficiencies in the NOA appear to be minor, 
however some control issues need to be resolved. For one lntennediate in the fosphenytoin 
synthesis, there is no data to show that it is not present aa an impurity in the drug 
substance. The proposed impurity limits for the drug product need to be evaluated. 
CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Establishment Evaluations, Microbiology and Environmental A1seaamant are still pending as is 
Methods Validation (thl• cannot be initiated until we obtain a aat11factory response to questions 
about possible impurities in the n.d.s., aee Item 8 of draft letter). Due to these issues, and 
manufacturing deftcienciel! •n both the NOA and OMF · the NOA is Not Approvable for 
Chemistry at thia time.

Injeaticm 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the National 
Environmental P~licy Act of 1969 (NEPA) as the national charter for protection, restoration, and enhancement of t.~e environment .. 
NBPA eatablishaa policy, aeta g..:>al• (•action 101), and provide• 
procedures (section 102) for carrying out the policy. 
Environmental information ia to be available to the public and the decl ... 'nmaker before decisions are made about ac~ ... ona that 
may sir~ ~icantly affect the quality of the human •n••ronm•nt; 
FDA act-Jn& are to be aupported by accurate •cientific analyaea; 
and environmental documents a%e to concentrate on timely and 
significant i••uea, not to am••• needle•• detail . 
. The Food and Drug Adminiwtration, Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research has carefully conaidered the potential environmental 
impact of this action and has concluded that thi• action will not 
have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment 
and that an environmental impact statement therefore will not be 
prepared. 
In •upport of their new drug application tor C•~ebyx•, Warn•r­
La:mbert Company has conducted a number of environmental atudiea 
and prepared an environmental aasea•ment in accordance with 21 
CFR 25.lla(a) (attached) which evaluates the potential 
environmental impacts of the manufacture, uae and diapo•al of the product. 
Foaphenytoin sodium is a synthetic drug which is administered aa 
an injectable solution in the treatment and control of seizures 
in patient• with •tatu• epilepticu•. The drug •ubstance will be 
manufactured at Parke-Davia Holland Chemical Facility, Holland, 
Michigan. The drug product will be manufactured at Parke-Davia 
Rocheate~ Facility, Rochester, Michigan. The finished drug 
product will be used in hoapitala and clinica. .... 
Fosphenytoin sodium is a prodrug which is rapidly and completely 
converted to phenytoin in vivo. Patient excretions contain a 
small percentage of the dose as phenytoin (<St), some dihydrodiol 
phenytoin (-7-llt) and the major metabolite 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-
5-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) (-67-BBt). Small amounts of 
foaphenytoin sodium may enter the environment due to manufacture. 
Chemical and physical test result• indicate that fosphenytoin 
sodium, phenytoin and, the major metabolite, p-HPPH will moat likely be re•tricted to the aquatic environment. 
Hydrolysia of fosphanytoin and phel'.'.ytoin and photolysis of 
f oaphenytoin sodium is expected to be slow under ehvironmental 
conditions. Foaphenytoin is rapidly biotransformed to phenytoin 
under biodegradation test oonditiona, phanytoin is not chemically 
converted and p-HPPH can be completely biodegraded, although the 
biodegradation is not rapid. 
As fosphenytoin and the major metabolites are expected to p6raiat in the aquatic environment for some time, the toxicity of 
f oaphenytoin sodium, phenytoin and p-HPPH to aquatic organi•m• 
was characterized. Acute •tatic toxicity studiea in water fleas 
(Daphnia magna) indicate that the drug substance is generally not 
toxic to aquatic organiama •t concentr•tiona of at leaat s orders 
of magnitude greater than the maximum expected environmental concentration (MBIC) . 
Microbial inhibition atudiea indicate that environmental 
microorgeni&ma are not inhibited at concentration~ of at least 7 
ordere of magnitude gr~ater than the maximum expected 
environmental concentration (MillC) • 
Disposal of the drug may result from out of apecification lots, 
discarding of unused or expired product, and u•er dispoaal of 
empty or partly used product and packaging. Returned drug 
product will be diapoaed of at a licenaed incineration facility. Out-of-specification drug product and drug aubstance will be 
reprocessed or disposed of at a licen•ed in~ineration facility. 
At U.S. hospital• and clinics, empty or partially empty packages will be disposed according to hoapital/clinic regulation•. 
The Center for Drug Evaluation •~rt Reaearch ha• oonoludad that 
the product can be manufactured, uaed and diapoaed of without ~ny 
expectAd adverse ~nvironmental effect•. Precaution• taken at the siteG of manufacture of the bulk product and ita final 
formul '£tion are expected to minimize occupational expoaurea and 
environmental release. Adverae effects are not anticipated upon 
endangered or threatened apeci•• or upon property liated in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

Division of the Warner-Lambert Company 
Attention: Irwin G. Martin, Ph.D 
2800 Plymouth Road, P. 0. Box 104 7 
Ann Arbor, Ml 48106-1047 
Dear Dr. Martin: Public Health Service 
Food and Drug Administration 
Rockville MD 20857 
SEP I 2 1994 
Reference is made to your new drug application submitted under section 505(b) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Fosphenytoin Sodium Injection (Cerebyx®). 
On the basis of our initial review of your New Drug Application referred to above, 
received on July 15, 1994 and acknowledged on July 28, 1994, we have determined that 
the application is not acceptable for fifing under 21 CFR 314. 101 (d)(3). 
The application is incomplete because it does not on its face contain information required 
under section 505(b) and 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5). 
Clinical Safety pata: 
1. Inadequate studies to show that the product will be safe for use under the 
conditions of use recommended in the proposed labeling. 
The application contains reports of only 4 patients with status epilepticus who 
have been treated with fospt1enytoin at rates of infusion at or above 225 mg/min. 
Experience in normals at this dose and rate combination is also limited: although 
the application does not supply a precise number, preliminary review estimates 
that no more than 20 normals may have been so exposed. 
Accordingly. the information submitted is inadequate to permit a substantive 
assessment of whether or not fosphenytoin will be safe for use when administered 
under the conditions of use recommended in the Dosage and Administration 
Section of the proposed labeling which recommends, for the treatment of Status 
Epilepticus, that an intravenous dose of 22.5 to 30 mg/kg given "At least 1 SO 
mg/min up to 225 mg/min" be administered as a single dose. Additionally, the 
section recommends, for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures, that an IM NOA 20-450 2 
or IV administration of 15 to 30 mg/kg fosphenytoin be given "up to 225 mg/min" 
as a single dose. 
2. Lack of tests and/or reports on tests to show that the drug will be safe for use; a 
lack of information on the plasma concentrations of formaldehyde: 
The application does not provide reports on the concentration of formaldehyde 
formed in plasma during the administration of your product when used as 
recommended in product labeling. Formaldehyde is a toxin and is formed during 
the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
Your firm has been advised repeatedly for the need to provide this information, 
and has, nevertheless, failed to do so. 
We note that your NOA SUMMARY;NDA Overview subsection (Item 2.2, page 
106) discusses this and states that a complete discussion of this issue could be 
found under NOA Item 5, section 5.5.4.6, Ta~i 55. Our preliminary review of the 
cited reference to clinical data (RR 744-00024, Study 9653-86-01) reveals, 
however, that NO data regarding formate levels in human trials is included in the 
cited study report. 
Environmental Assessment 
Although not reasons for this Refuse to File Action, our environmental assessment staff 
has completed a preliminary review of your EA and has asked that the following 
comments be forwarded. 
1. General issues: 
a. The drug substance and drug product are incorrectly identified throughout 
the environmental assessment (e.g., the drug substance is identified as 
Fosphenytoin instead of the sodium salt). Please correct the 
environmental assessment (pages 3-28) to reflect the correct terminology. 
b. The information in the Environmental Assessment is releasable under the 
Freedom of Information Act. Any proprietary information should be 
provided in Appendices and be clearly marked as confidential. Some of 
the information included in your environmental assessment may be 
confidential (e.g., the list of raw materials used in the synthesis of 
Fosphenytoin Sodium or the fifth year production estimates). If you wish 
you may move this information to an appendix and provide only summary 
information in the actual environmental assessment. NDA2~450 3 
c. A flow diagram for the synthesis of the drug substance and the

Package Insert: Should additional information relating to the safety and 
effectiveness of Cerebyx" become available prior to our receipt of the final printed 
labeling, revision of that labeling may be required. 
Product and Container Labeling: Please revise all product and container labeling 
to appropriately convey that dosage conversion calculations do not need to be 
performed when converting patients between fosphenytoin and phenytoin (i.e., all 
labeling should clearly convey that 50 mg/ml of phenytoin is being delivered and 
that NO dosage conversion factor need be applied). 
2. Mjcrobjology; 
The following microbiological issues concerning sterility assurance and other issues 
have net been compl&tely addressed: 
a. Bulk solution bioburden limits (prior to filtration) should be specified and •he 
methods to test this, including sample points, should oe described. 
Historical data may be provide-..1 in support of the established limit. We 
prefer the sample collection point be identified in the manufacturing 
instructions. 
b. The frequency of requalifying sterilizers (autoclaves and tunnels) was 
specified as every 2 years. We generally recommend more frequent 
evaluation of the instrument and process. NOA 20-450 page 3 
c. The operating parameters for sterilization of filters and filling equipment were 
not provided and their validation was not discussed. 
d. Validation of the integrity of the container and closure systems' barrier to 
microbial ingress was not discussed. Please provide a summary of the 
methods and results demonstrating the integrity of this system. 
e. Your amendment dated October 27, 1995 describes specifications for media 
fills (Tab 5, Appendix 1, page 19). The stated Alert Limit permits no 
investigation of any kind when as many as 2 containers are contaminated in 
a batch of 5000. We encourage some investigation of any evidence of 
contamination in product (simulated or otherwise) manufactured by a 
process for sterile product. 
3. Manufacturing and Controls: 
Safety Update

SUBJECT: Cerebyx® [foaphaytoln Injection] NOA 20·460 Approvable Action 
TO: Robert Temple, MD, Director, ODE 1 
Ii 
Fiie NOA 20·460 
This memorandum provides a discussion of several factors affecting the 
regulatory action that might be taken in regard to Parke-Davis' pending 
NOA 20-450 for Cerebyx® [fosphenytoin]. 
Several options, ranging from approval to disapproval are defensible. As a 
matter of tactics, however, the action letter being forwarded declares the 
NOA approvable, albeit under a number of conditions that are enumerated 
both within the text of the letter and within a version of product labeling 
developed by the division (i.e., in 'notes to the firm' embedded within the 
text) that would be attached to the letter, if issued. If the Office were to 
choose an alternative action, the draft approvable letter may be modified 
accordingly. 
Introductory Comments and notes about the administrative 
strategy app!led In the eyaluatlon of this NOA 
The structure of the arguments supporting approval 
Although Cerebyx® [fosphenytoin] is a new chemical entity, an approval of 
the NDA for Cerebyx® is only possible, given the type of the information 
provided in the NOA, because Dilantin®, Parke Davis' innovator brand of 
phenytoin, is an approved anti-epileptic drug product [AED]. Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 2 •• 
The conclusion that Cerebyx® is effective in use, In particular, t1.1ms not 
on reports of adequate and well controlled clinical investigations, but 
upon 1) the knowledge that phenytoin is an effective AED, 2) that 
fosphenytoin is completely converted within minutes of injection to 
phenytoin and 3) evidence adduced by the sponsor in biopharmacokinetlc 
and clinical trials showing that when Cerebyx® is administered under the 
directions provided in the proposed Cerebyx® product labeling, the 
resulting plasma levels of phenytoin approximate those that are obtained 
when Dilantin injection is administered under its recommended conditions 
of use for the same claimed use. 
Although the agency's earlier determination that the benefits of Dilantin® 
injection outweigh the risks of its use is a necessary element In the chain 
of argument and evidence that can be used to support a conclusion that 
Cerebyx® will be safe for use under its proposed labeling, the 
determination involving Dilantin® is, in and of itself, insufficient to 
support the conclusion about Cerebyx·~·s safety. Not only is fosphenytoin 
a different molecular species than phenytoin (and, therefore, may pose an 
entirely distinct panoply of risks unrelated to its conversion to 
phenytoin), but fosphenytoin injection yields two/three molecular 
species, phosphate and formaldehyde/formate that are not produced when 
Dilantin is administered. How these differences affect the regulatory 
decision, and how well I believe they have been addressed by the firm, are 
discussed in a later section of this memorandum. 
An administrative Issue affecting labeling of both Cerebyx~ and 
Pllantln~ 
Cerebyx® labeling can be viewed as addressing both fosohenytoin specific 
(e.g., fosphenytoin, formate, phosphate) and phenytoin related issues. The 
latter, to the extent that they represent information not currently 
included in Dilantin® labeling pose a problem in that, with the marketing 
of Cerebyx®, there would be in existence different, arguably 
contradictory, statements ab1'>ut the same drug substance (phenytoin) in 
the labeling of two different approved drug products (Dilanting and 
Cerebyx®). 
While we do not propose ~o ri;,solve the problem by linking the approval of Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 3 
~. 
the Cerebyx® NOA to full revision of Oilantin® product labeling, we do 
recommend, if the Cerebyx® NOA is declared approvable, asking the firm 
to revise the content of those sections of Oilantin® product labeling (both 
oral and injectable) that differ substantively from Cerebyx® product 
labeling (e.g., phenytoin specific matters vis a vis pregnancy, 
teratogenicity, etc.) and to submit labeling supplements to a111 their 
Oilantin product NOAs at the same time as they make a response to a 
Cerebyx® approvable action letter. 
Effectiveness In Ustt. 
As noted in the preceding section, although the Cerebyx® NOA contains no 
reports of adequate and well controlled clinical investigations that 
document fosphenytoin injection's capacity to suppress seizures, the 
effectiveness of the product as an anti-epileptic drug [AEO] can be deemed 
established on the grounds that 1) fosphenytoin is a prodrug for phenytoin2 
and 2) under the conditions of use recommended in the labeling proposed 
by the Division, Cerebyx® injection will yield plasma levels of free 
phenytoin that are sufficiently close3 to those that would be produced 
1 The firm mig!"it not choose to revise Dilantin® injection because they 
intend that it be replaced by Cerebyx®; I would recommend that we insist that they 
do, however, in part to ensure that generic labeling for injectable phenytoin is 
consistent with Cerebyx®. 
2 Each molar unit of administered fospheytoin is converted to an equimolar 
quantity of phenytoin. 
3 It is acknowledged tt>.at 'dose' has no clinically defined or generally 
recognized meaning The word is intended to convey a judgment by the review 
team that the rate and extent of free phenytoin delivery to the systemic circulation 
that follow;; the administration of Cerebyx® do not differ from the rate and extent of 
free phenytoin delivery that follows the administration of Dilantin® injection to a 
degree that will a cause a clinically significant difference in treatment response. This 
judgment, admittedly, cannot be supported by reference to empirical findings; there 
is no established quantitative relationship between changes in the rate and extent of 
phenytoin delivery and changes in the percent of patients experiencing a satisfactory 
anti-epileptic response in any of the clinical settings in which parenteral phenytoin 
is recommended. While such a judgment is, therefore, undeniably arbitrary, it is Leber: Cerebyx® [phOSQt}enytoin injection] approvable action page 4 
when Dilantin® injection is administered for the same indication4 under 
Oilantin® injection's recommended conditions for use to allow Cerebyx® 
injection to be used in place of Dilantin.® injection. 
As noted, the bioequivalence of Cerebyx® and Oilantin® injection have not 
been demonstratec under every possible set of doses and routes of 
administration being recommended in Cerebyx® ~abeling. It is our 
judgment, however, that the products are 'fungible' when given in 
equimolar doses in settings where the extent, but not the rate, of 
phenytoin delivery controls its effectiveness. 
In the one situation in which rate of phenytoin availability is deemed of 
critical clinical importance, that is, intravenous loading for the treatment 
of status epilepticus, the firm has been able to develop a regimen of use 
under which the pharmacokinetic performance of Cerebyx® and Dilantin® 
injection are bioequivalent by ordinary agency criteria (i.6., the 90% CL 
limjts on the ratio of the realized values of the estimates for the usual PK 
parameters of the new to the old product are <: 0.8 and s 1.25). 
A digression concerning the doses of phenytoin and fosphenytoin studied 
may be helpful at this point. The molecular weight of fosphenytoin is 
approximately 1.5 times that of phenytoin; accordingly a dose of phenytoin 
only 0.67 that of fosphenytoin is equimolar to the latter. Unfortunately, it is 
sometimes difficult to be certain whether or not the dose of fosphenytoin 
every bit as reasonable as the one that allows the agency to declare products that 
differ in their biopharmacokinetic performance 'bioequivalent' as long as the 
difference in their performance falls within some arbitrary tolerance limits (e.g., the 
90% confidence limits on the ratio of realized estimates for a particular 
pharmacokinetic parameter , say Cmax or AUC, for two products, falls between 0.8 
and 1.25). Having said all this, however, it should be noted that the firm did show 
that fosphenytoin and phenytoin can deliver free phenytoin to the same rate and 
extent under one specific set conditions of dose and rate of administration. (see 
discuss.ion of study 982-240).

identified in file documents (e.g., in both FDA review documents and 
sponsor's reports), is intended to represent the actual weight of fosphenytoin 
or the weight expressed in phenytoin eqyiyalents CPE). that is. the weiiht of 
phenytoin that would.,xjgld an eq11imolar amount of pbenytojn as the 
fosphenytoin dose actually administered. There is not much that can be 
done about these ambiguities in usage other than to b~ aware of them. 
The table that follows provides a concrete example: it enumerates the actual 
mass doses for both fospbenytoin and phenytoin that would generate the 
same molar amount of pbenytoin in status epilepticus. Note that the rate of 
phenytoin specified in the table is not actually deliverable with Dilantin<» 
injection because the maximum rate of intravenous administration for that 
product is 50 mg/ min. 
Drug dose rate 
fosphenytoin 22.5 to 30 mg/kg 150 to 225 mg/ min 
phenytoin 15 to 20 mg/kg ••100 to 150 mg/min 
•• theoretical: pbenytoin cannot safely be delivered at this rate; 50 
mg/min is the maximum recommended rate. 
Study 98224 shows Cerebyx• and Dilantin• bioequivalent under the iv 
loading infusion regimen employed (i.e., see the table above). It bears 
repetition that this regimen is intended for use when phenytoin is being 
administered intravenously to a patient in status epilepticus: this is the 
only clinical setting, in our judgrnent, in which a decrease in the rate of 
systemic phenytoin delivery might have an adverse effect on clinical 
outcome. In all other settings, we assume that it is the e:ic,'ent, not the 
rate, of phenytoin delivery that is controlling. 
A digression about the method used to assess the relative rate at which 
Cerebyx<» and Dilantin• infusions deiiver free pbenytoin is useful here. 
When drugs are administered by tonstant intravenous infusion, the Cmax 
and Tmax occur typically at the end of the infusion and the realized values of 
these parameter estimates are controlled, other variables held constant, by 
both the total dose and the rate of delivery of that dose. 
In ordinary circumstances, therefore, the administration of two drug products 
that yield the same molar amounts of the same drug substanc:e cannot 
possibly generate bioequivalent delivery profiies if they are adminii.tered at Leber: Cerebyx<1> [phosghenytoin injectior.] approvable action page 6 
different rates of infusion. The situation is different where Cereby~ and 
Dilantin® are concerned, however. 
A number of events and phenomena, including fosphenytoin protein 
binding, fosphenytoin hydrolysis, phenytoin protein binding, and phenytoin 
displacement from protein bound sites affect the rate at which Cereby~ 
infusion delivers free phenytoin. As a consequence, Cereb~ must be 
administered at a faster rate than Dilantin® injection to deliver free 
phenytoin at an equivalent rate and extent. 
The parameter employed to compare the pace of free phenytoin delivery by 
the two products is the ratio of their cumulative AUCs for free phenytoin. 
The ratio is obtained by dividing the cumulative AUC for free phenytoin at 
some time, t, following the start of the infusion of Cereb~, by the 
cumulative AUC for free phenytoin at the same time, t, following the start of 
an infusion of Dilantin<I> injection. If the two products deliver free phenytoin 
at the same rate, the ratio will be unity at all times.

The Division's consultant biopharmaceutical review team has evaluated 
the firm's report of Study 98224 and concludes that it documents that a Leber: Csrebyx• [phosphenytoin injection) approvable action page 7 •• 
dose of 1200 mg PE of fosphenytoin5 delivered intravenously at a rate of 
150 mg PE/min produces the same cumulative free phenytoin AUC over 
time as a dose of 1200 mg of phenytoin .delivered at 50 mg/min. 
Even in study 98224, however, the performance of the two products ls not 
precisely identical throughout the entire post-dosing intervQI as the plot 
of the ratio of the cumulative free phenytoin AUC demonstrates (see the 
figure on the preceeding page which is reproduced from the top panel of 
Figure 13 on page 12 of the 12121/95 biopharm review). In short, even in 
this study, the technical declaration of bioequivalence is somewhat 
arbitrary as it turns on the time after the start of infusion that is chosen 
for the evaluation of the cumulative AUC ratio. 
In this regard, it is important to note that the regimen selected for 
Cerebyx• infusion ensures that in comparison to Dilantin® more, rather 
than less tree phenytoir., is generated early on in the course of the 
infusion (e.g., from 10 to 30 minutes or so), the very period in which it is 
deemed critically important from a clinical perspective to ensure the 
rapid delivery of bioavailable phenytoin. 
Safety in Use: specific Issues. 
Whether or not fosphenytoin is safe in use cannot rest on the knowledge 
that phenytoin is a safe drug, however. Because fosphenytoin is not only a 
prodrug tor phenytoin but for phosphates and formaldehyde/formates, the 
risks that might be associated with the parenteral administration of 
these products under the conditions of use recommended in Cerebyx 
labeling must be considered. 
Both Dr. Edward Fisher, the primary reviewing pharmacologist, and Dr. 
John Feeney, the neurology group clinical reviewer responsible for the 
5 20 mg/kg given to a 60 kg patient results in 1200 mg total dose 
s Each molar unit of fosphenytoin forms equimolar units of phosphate and 
formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is then converted to formate which is then converted 
to COi and H20 by a folate dependent step. Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 8 
~ . 
application, discuss rist,.i; that might derive from the generation of the 
byproducts of fosphenytoin hydrolysis. 
It is important to acknowledge at the outset that concerns about the 
potential risks posed by these byproducts arise for theoretical reasons; 
there are no findings of serious injur1 or toxicity in either clinical or 
preclinical tests with fosphenytoin that indicate that either formate or 
phosphate derived from fosphenytoin administration has actually caused 
hann. 
On the other side of coin, however, a systematic effort to detect toxicity 
that might have been caused by these byproducts (particularly fonnate) 
has not been carried out either in animals or humans. Perhaps more 
important as a reason for caution, the extent of clinical exposure to 
Cerebyx® at the highest doses and rates of delivery is limited7 and, 
accordingly, the warrant provided by the absence of evidence of harm is 
less than robust. 
~~ormate: the risk of ocular injury 
Although no reports of blindness or diminished vision have been reported 
in association with the clinical testing of Cerebyx, formate, a known 
mammalian ocular toxins is a by product of fosphenytoin hydrolysis. As 
much as 5 mmoles of fonnate may be delivered within 7 minutes under the 
regimen recommended for Cerebyx" in the management of status 
epilepticus [SE]. 
Although the firm had been repeatedly advised of our concern about the 
potential risk posed by formate exposure, it has yet to provide a 
systematic evaluation of the extent of, and variability in, formate 
7 Only 128 patients have been exposed to doses of greater than 15 mg PE/kg 
at ~n infusion rates of<? 150 mg PE/min and only 66 patients at this rate and the 
higher dose of 20 mg PE/kg. 
e Studies in monkeys document that formate levels as low as 7 MMOL/L can 
cause optic nerve damage; formate is presumably the agent immediately responsible 
for the blindness that is associated with methanol ingestion Leber: Cerebyx«' [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action 
~. page 9 
generation following intravenous loading with fosphenytoin. In fact, only 
4 patients have had formate levels measured, and then during infusions 
that delivared only one-half the load of .fosphenytoin recommended for the 
treatment of status epilepticus. 
Also, since the metabolism of formate is folate dependent, and a 
substantive proportion of patients with status epilepticus may be folate 
deficient (e.g., alcoholics), the issue is not only the extent c,f monitored 
experience, but the collateral conditions under which exposure has taken 
place. 
The risk assessment process is further complicated by the sparseness of 
the information available from preclinical models. At present, we 
believe (know) that exposures as low 7 MMOUL can cause ocular damage in 
monkeys, but do not know whether or not lower exposures can. 
On the other hand, Dr. Fisher points out that sustaineC: exposures 1· 
elevated levels of formate are probably required to cause injury in humans 
and that the firm did estimate, based on data available from other 
sources, the likely increment in serum formate that would follow an 
infusion of formate equivalent to that delivered by the maximum 
recommended dose of fosphenytoin, and that such an input would be 
unlikely to raise formate levels above background, let alone produce those 
known to cause injury. 
Accordingly, in my view, concerns about formate are not of a c:oncem vis a 
vis the approvability of Cerebyx, although they probably require memion in 
labeling, unless the firm can provide either argument or data, or both to 
convince us such mention is unnecessary. 
Risks of a phosphate load. 
Dr. Feeney draws attention to the risks that might follow rapid IV 
administration of a phosphate load. Both serum ionized calcium levels 
and pH may be affected, but neither have been systematica:ly monitored by 
the sponsor. As with the concerns discussed in regard to formate, I 
believe we ought to require mention of the possibility of these effects in 
labeling unless the sponsor can provide evidence or argument to show that Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action ... page 10 
such labeling statements are unnecessary. 
Systemic sensations 
In his review, Dr. Feeney discusses a set of sensations that are associated 
with infusion of Cerebyx (burr.ing/pruritus affecting the extremities, the 
groin and in pen-rectal areas9); since these are not observed with 
phenytoin infusion, it is logical that they are the result of some unique 
property of fosphenytoin, its byproducts, or some secon:lary phenomena 
arising from their introduction into the systemic circulation. 
Phosphate, for example, might act directly or indirectly through an effect 
on serum Calcium levels. The usual signs/symptoms of tetany (peri-oral 
dysthesias, tingling in the distal extremities, etc.), however, do seem 
distinguishable from those associated with fosphenytoin infusion; 
nonetheless. the possibility that changes in serum Calcium are involved 
cannot be dismissed out-of-hand. 
The bottom line, however, is that our ability to assess any hypothesis 
regarding the cause of these pher, ·Tiena is limited by the minimal 
monitoring of serum formate, Calcium, phosphate and pH done by the firm. 
Fataljtjes 
The population treated with fosphenytoin is likely to be at substantially 
greater risk of death than the typical cohort of patients with complex 
partial seizures who participate in the usual AED development program. In 
particular, the fosphenytoin cohort includes patients in status, those with 
head trauma, etc, and as a consequence is a cohort in which deaths, 
regardless of treatment, are expected. 
Accordingly, I am not concerned about the number of deaths reported in 
9 Dr. Feeney writ.es that "the character and location of the sensory 
disturbance described for Decadron and Hydrocortisone matches the dominant 
description in Cerebyx-treated sur.jects. With all 3 agents, patients describe a burning 
or itching which localizes primarily to the groin area." Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action 
~. page 11 
association with the use of fosphenytoin. This judgment, however, is 
defended only by my personal intuition, no more, no less. 
Safety and Common ADBs 
This is largely a labeling display issue. The firm has studied Cerebyx@ 
over a number of disparate conditions in different patient populations. It 
makes no sense in my view, to combine these experiences in an effort to 
provide a single, overall, table of untoward clinical event incider.ce. 
lnstAad, it makes far more sense to present the incidence within the 
various settings. We instruct the firm, within the text of labeling, how 
best to accomplish this goal. 
Safety jn Children 
This important age group has not been evaluated; if approved, Cerebyx@ is 
likely to be used in children, yet we do not have information on their 
handling of the product. 
Safety in Use· oyeral! considerations: 
The extent of clinical experience with an investigati"nal drug, the degree 
to which that experience is representative of the conditions under which 
the drug will be used if marketed, and the quality and kind of patient 
monitoring during the drug's clinical testing determine the strength and 
value of any warrant that may be offered about the safety of a drug at the 
time of its approval. 
Obviously, the fewer the number of patients exposed, the less reliable any 
warrant about the drug; this applies both to risks that were and those that 
were not observed during the product's pre-marketing development. 
This generic caveat applies to any regulatory conclusion that a drug is 
'safe for use;' but it is especially applicable where Cerebyx® is concerned. 
First, because this product has been administered to relatively few 
individuals overall. The total numbers of subjects exposed are 
enumerated in the following table: Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 12 -.

Deaths/Serious AEs Nov 18, 94 May 15, 95 Sept. 15, 1995 
Of greater concern, Cerebyx® has been administered to even fewer under 
conditions of use where it is expected to cause the greatest number of 
problems: high rate intravenous infusion. Specifically, as of the last 
safety update, only 128 patients had been exposed to doses <:15 mg PE/kg 
at an jnfusjon rates of <: 150 mg PE!mjn and only 66 have been exposed jQ 
doses <: 20 PE/kg at infusjon rates of <: 150 mg PE/mjn. 
Whether or not this extent of clinical testing provides an adequate basis 
to allow the marketing of Cerebyx® under these conditions is a 
determination that turns on personal judgment, and, therefore, ultimately, 
the personal judgment of the agency official who has the delegated 
authority to act on the question, in this case, the Office Director. 
Discussion of Options 
Although the evidence provided by the sponsor is probably sufficient to 
allow some expert epil~ptologists to reach, responsibly, a conclusion that 
Cerebyx® has been shown to be safe for use under high dose, high rate 
conditions of use recommended in its proposed labeling, I cannot know 
whether most, or even a majority of experts, would reach the same 
conclusion. 
Accordingly, the division has prepared an approval action letter because it 
believes such an action can be defended, although it is not necessarily the Leber: Cerebyx® [phosphenytoin injection] approvable action page 13 
~. 
action that any of us may individually prefer•o. 
In any case, I could also defend ar. action approving the NOA under labeling 
that either 1) warns about the residual ·uncertainties concerning the 
safety of the high dose regimen, or 2) omits the high dose/high rate 
regimen on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to ensure its 
safety. 
Neither of these options is entirely appealing, however, because Cerebyx® 
is only able to deliver phenytoin as rapidly as Oilantin® injection under 
the high dose, high rate regimen, and, therefore, we could not be certain, 
under either of these options, that Cerebyx would be fully effective (or as 
effective as Oilantin® injection), whan used in the management of status. 
We could, of course, disapprove the NOA, arguing, as we did when it was 
first submitted, that more clinical experience (i.e., safe passage) with the 
product under the high intravenous loading dose regimen is required before 
we can conclude that it is safe in use regardless of the restrictions 
placed on its use in labeling. The argument being made here is that 
whatever the labeling limitations or restrictions applied, the product 
would, if marketed, be likely to be used under the high dose/high rate 
regimen, a regimen yet to be shown to be safe. 
This would be a difficult regulatory position to defend, however, because 
we are only obliged, at least ordinarily, to determine whether or not a 
drug is safe for use under the conditions of use recommended in its 
labeling. In short, were it not for the status epilepticus indication, it 
would be easy to conclude that Cerebyx® has been shown to be safe for 
use. On the other hand, none of us is unaware of the extent of 'off label' 
use of marketed ciriJg products and the potential for that use to cause 
harm. 
10 Personally, I would clearly Feel more comfortable with an approvable 
action if it were taken with the knowledge that 200, rather than 66 patients, had been 
exposed without serious incident to the highest dose and rate intravenous loading 
regimen. The problem, of course, is that I would take still greater comfort if there 
were 2000 such exposures. Leber: CerebyxGP [phosi.}l)enytoin injection] approvable action page 14 
Importantly, nothing in this discussion is intended to gainsay or 
undermine the potential advantages that may well be provided by 
Ce re by x®. An injectable form of phenytoin that is less locally irritating 
than Dilantin® (reasonably inferred from what we know but not proven) 
wo11ld be especially useful for intramus,~ular use. The point is that it is a 
matter of personal judgment whether the gains are sufficient to outweigh 
our residual doubts about its safety for use. 
Finelly, neither I, nor any member of the review team, to my knowledge, 
is so wedded to any single view of this matter that we are absolutely 
committed to one and only one course of action. To the contrary, this is a 
close decision and I can accept any of the 3 options enumerated. I am, as 
are members of the review team, available to disc th.§.

I believe this application is approvable and that the available 
data and documented exposure are sufficient for a proding for a 
very familiar active moiety. The possibility remains, as you 
note, that some rare, "idiosyncratic" response to the short-liver 
parent molecule, or to a minor unsuspected metabolite of the 
parent, could occur, but a few ioo more patients will not resolve 
that question. 
I have modified the letter slightly, I think still reflecting 
what was sought by the Division. 
I have one regulatory, not scientific question: why is 
fosphenytoin considered an NME? Type 4 NDAs include new salts or 
esters of a previously approved active moiety. Although 
allowance is made for stable esters, especially where these are 
active (e.g., isorsorbide mono-odinitrate) that does;1't seem the 
case here, with the 15 minute half-life.

Robert Temple, M.D. 
Director, 
Office of Drug Evaluation 1 
The Division's review team has reviewed the comments about the Cerebyx 
action presented in your memo to me of 2120/96. 
We take your point that the intravenous administration of Cerebyx under any 
dosing regimen cannot precisely reproduce the phenytoin input to the 
systemir: circulation that is obtained with the direct infusion c! phenytoin 
sodium at 50 mg/min. Accordingly, we have revised the dosing instructions 
so that the recommended regimen for the treatment of status is betwean 100 
mg PE/min and 150 mg PE/min. This should result in an intermediate choice 
by many and that will be fine. 
For the most part, we have otherwise made the changes in the labeling and 
letter as you requested. except for one or two places. 
Oosjng and Admjnjstration Section: 
Here, we found your additional comments to be verbose and confusing. 
Accordingly, we simplified the instructions, providing the major points 
regarding iv use in a series of 4 brief bullets. 
We did, however. incorporate the intent of your comments in this section in 
the Clinical Pharmacology Section. 
Warnm~ Section: 
The instruction regarding the maximum rate of phosphenytoin infusion seems Leber: NOA 20-450 note on memorandum of 2120196 pa~e 2

unnecessarily confusing when it includes the phrase "at rates greater ,han 
50 mg/min." We would prefer deleting the phrase. The call, however, is 
clearly yours and toward that end we provide two pages 6's, one with and one 
without the phrase. 
Pharmacology: 
I have allowed Ed Fisher and Glenna to repair and revise the pharm sections 
as they believe best. I find their changes reasonable and assume that you 
will as well. 
Questions jn the memorandum: 
First, fosphenytoin is an ester, but not of phenytoin. It's an NME and we can 
take credit accordingly. 
As to your other questions, I'm not sure that I can answer them in a 
meaningful manner; I'll try (John Feeney is my major source of inspiration 
and data on this). 
# 4. How, if at all, renal and/or liver disease affects fosphenytoin to 
phenytoin conversion is unknown. The theory is that the free fraction of 
fosphenytoin is increased in the presence of hypoproteinemia. 
# 5. Yes, because this is part of a regimen that will lead to the chronic 
use of phenytoin 
#6. Dilantin is an ancient drug product--many things in its labeling 
got there the same way that they get into the labeling of all older drugs--in 
short. we don't know, and, don't have the resourcf's available currently to 
find out. 
I trust you can sign this approvable action as is; if ~:-tel us know.

Third Safety Update 
April 12, 1996 
April 15, 1996 
Background: This safety update consists of 2 volumes out of a 4 volurne 
submission. The entire submission repressnts the sponsor's response to a 
recent Approvable Letter. 
Exposure: The cutoff date for the last (second) safety update was 
September 15, 1995. This SU covers all deaths, serious AEs, and 
withdrawals for AEs that have occurred since then. Data are also provided 
from 2 studies of Fos which '!re being conducted under a 
separate IND . Events from all studies are summarized through 
March 8, 1996. 
It appears that there is .inly one ongoing study in status epilepticus. Only 
5 additional pts have been enrolled since the last (second) SU. Of these 5, 
no deaths, serious AEs, or withdrawals because of serious AEs have been 
reported. Therefore, this SU reports almost entirely on th6 experience of 
Cerebyx in stroke. 
Deaths: 10 deaths (on placebo or Fos) occurred out of 79 pts enrolled in 
stroke studies. We know that 1/10 deaths occurred on Fos and 1/10 
deaths occurred on placebo. Because ~he blind has not been broken in the 
other stroke study, we do not know the treatment assignment of the 8 
other deaths. All deaths appear related to the stroke itself or the 
sequelae of stroke. None of the deaths were attributed to Fos. 
Serious, Nonfatal AEs: 5 pts had serious AEs that were nonfatal. One 
of these, severe hypotension related to Cerebyx was reported as an IND 
safety report on March 12, 1996 and is outlined in the next paragraph. The 
blind was not broken for the other AEs, but a review of them suggests that 
none would be considered attributed to study drug. Pt 113 in Study 25, a .. 51-yr-old woman, developed an absolute decrease of 
67 in her systolic pressure during a loading dose of Cerebyx for treatment 
of stroke. BP was 142/86 and dropped to 75/50. The investigator 
classified the event as life-threatening, although the BP returned to 
baseline with fluids. 
Withdrawals Due to AEa: 5 pts withdrew due to AEs. 3/5 occurred in a 
completed stroke study so that we know all 3 received Cerebyx. The other 
2 occurred in an ongoing strco!<:e study where the blind has not been broken. 
Patients 111 in Study 19 in stroke had the infusion stopped (note that the 
rate was 50 mgPE/min) because of perinea! burning and itching. The event 
was called severe and occurred after only 27% of the injection was given. 
Symptoms resolved after13 minutes followed an hour later by recurrence 
of mild itching for 5 min. 
Patients 118 in Study 19 in stroke had the infusion stopped (;iote that the 
rate was 50 mgPE/min) because of perinea! itching. The event was called 
moderate and occurred after 16% of the injection was given. Symptoms 
resolved in 5 minutes. 
Other events were mild. hypotension, severe bradycardia (treatment 
assignment unknown), and atrial fibrillation in a pt with a history of AFib 
(treatment assignment unknown). 
Summary: 
Burning, itching, bradycardia, hypotension are all described in proposed 
labeling. Therefore, the safety profile of -:e,!Jr~~ a not changed with 
the addition of this safety update.

Background: The entire 4-volume submission represents the sponsor's 
response to a recent Approvable Letter. Two volumes rApresent the 
requested safety update and are reviewed in a separate document. The 
other two volumes represent the proposed labeling revisions along with 
supporting documentation. 
Proposed Labeling Changes: Only major changes are addressed here. 
Two pervasive changes made by the sponsor are the correct insertion of 
the word sodium whenever describing equivalent doses of Cerebyx and 
parenteral Dilantin. Phenytoin as the free acid (Dilantin-30 Pediatric and 
Dilantin-125 Suspension$ and Dilantin lnfatabs) would have a different 
dose equivalence. The sponsor would also like to delete the PE used 
throughout labeling to refer to doses of Cerebyx. The very fact that 
different phenytoin products already on the market provide different 
amounts of phenytoin for equivalent weight-based dosing regimens would 
support the use of the PE notation throughout labeling to point out the 
equivalence only to phenytoin sodium and not to the free acid. 
Issues related to formate and phosphate have been addressed by the 
sponsor by presenting data from Study 27, a PK study of the high-dose, 
high-rate loading dose. Some of this data was pre:-;ented in submissions 
(specifically requested by me) dated May 2 and May 8, 1996. This 
information is discussed in Appendix I. cc:

Pharm!Tox Review, 1986 ................................................................................ 11 9 Overview 
Cerebyx (fosphenytoin) has been developed by Parke-Davis 
The basis for an approval action on this NOA is the demonstrated 
bioequivalence of IV Cerebyx and IV Dilantin. When Cerebyx was 
administered at an IV rate that was three times greater on a molar basis 
than the rate of Dilantin, bioequivalence based on free phenytoin levels 
was demonstrated. 
It became clear during the review of this NDA that confusion readily 
arises in discussing the dosage of Cerebyx. The molecular weight of 
Cerebyx is 50% greater than Dilantin, so that 150mg Cerebyx delivers the 
same molar amount of phenytoin as 100mg Dilantin. Therefore, an 
infusion rate of 75mg/min Cerebyx delivers the same molar amount of 
phenytoin as 50mg/min Dilantin (the maximal labeled rate for Dilantin). 
However. the bioequivalent rates (as defined above for free phenytoin 
levels) would be 225mg/min Cerebyx and 50mg/min Dilantin. 
Since the use of Cerebyx will, by design, be temporary with conversion to 
oral phenytoin soon thereafter, I believe that Cerebyx dosing should be 
expressed in phenytoin equivalents in labeling. Thus, 150mg Cerebyx 
would be expressed as 1 OOmg phenytoin equivalents (PE). This eliminates 
the one and only step in converting total oral phenytoin dosing to 
parenteral Cerebyx dosing, but still leaves one step in converting the 
Dilantin loading dose rate (50mg/min) to the bioequivalent Cerebyx 
loading dose rate (150mg/min phenytoin equivalents). By not expressing 
Cerebyx as PE in labeling, I believe there will be considerable confusion in 
dosing during the first few years of general use. 
1 Cerebyx is a phosphate ester of phenytoin. The bioavailability of 
phenytoin after IM Cerebyx is 100% with good local tolerability in over 
300 patients exposed. The sponsor contends that IV Cerebyx is better 
tolerated at the injection site than IV Dilantin. This latter point is 
supported by the normal volunteer studies when injection site irritation 
is examined in Cerebyx and Dilantin treated patients at bioequivalent 
rates. The active-control trials in patients did not adequately control for 
dose and rate betweeen Cerebyx and Dilantin patients, so that no 
additional comparative data on IV injection site irritation is yielded by 
those studies. Study 26 may provide comparative information along these 
lines, but we are not yet in possession of that final study report. 
Cerebyx is rapidly converted to phenytoin with a half-life of 15 minutes. 
The two byproducts of this conversion are phosphate and formaldehyde. 
The theoretical safety concerns of formaldehyde formation have been 
addressed by the sponsor and are the subject of much discussion in the 
pharm/tox review of Dr. Fisher. On page 60 of his review, Dr. Fisher notes 
(page 60 of his review) that peak plasma formaldehyde levels would be 
predicted to be 5.4mg/L, with levels returning to background levels 
(2.6mg/L) within 20 minutes. In fact, formaldehyde levels are apparently 
difficult to measure in plasma, and beyond this. the toxicity of 
formaldehyde may in large part be due to its metabolism to formate as 
occurs in methanol poisoning. 
Formate levels that produce optic nerve pathology are only 10-20 X 
background levels. Maximal formate levels were predicted by the sponsor 
to be no higher than background levels. This prediction has not been 
verified with empiric data to date. Formate levels were not measured in 
preclinical toxicity studies; in fact, models of formate toxicity in non­
primates can only be produced in the presence of folate deficiency. 
Normal formate levels were measured in 4 normal volunteers, but at a 
Cerebyx-exposure much less than will occur with the standard loading 
dose. In the absence of formate levels in adequately loaded subjects, the 
safety margin cannot be stated. 
Not addressed by the sponsor or the pharm/tox review is the phosphate 
load with Cerebyx. The loading dose of Cerebyx delivers 75mg elemental 
phosphorus. Assur11mg retention in the plasma, the theoretical increase in 
serum phosphorus would be 2mg/dl. If the calcium-phosphorus product 
2 exceeded 60-70 in a given patient, the theoretical concern would be 
calcium deposition in soft tissues and a possible transient decrease in 
calcium. The sponsor has measured ionized free calcium at the end of a 7 
minute loading dose in 5 volunteers and found these !e11els to be normal. 
Obviously, this is a small experience which should probably be expanded. 
Additionally, tile sponsor should be asked to assess the distribution of the 
phosphorus load in varying states of decreased glomerular filtration. 
Labeling should certainly make note of this issue, especially in dialysis 
patients. (The sponsor performed a study in dialysis patients, but used a 
small loading dose administered over 30 minutes.) 
The safety database accrued is complex and makes any exptrapolation of 
the results difficult. Several important points follow: 
First, the two active-control trials will IV Dilantin (Studies 15 and 21) 
do not allow any direct comparisons b9tween treatments. Both trials 
incorporated IV loading doses (one of the two also included maintenance 
IV dosing beyond the IV load) and I believe the loading dose presents the 
biggest safety concern in the use of Cerebyx. However, neither trial 
provided tor Cerebyx and Dilantin to be administered at the bioequivalent 
rates. (Study 26 may allow for some direct comparisons, but we do not 
have the final study report yet.) 
Second, as a general rule over the entire database, the high-dose, high­
rate Cerebyx patients were also some of the sickest patients, usually 
patients with status epilepticus. While this may in fact mirror the 
intended usage of hign-dose, high-rate Cerebyx, it makes the 
interpretation of the safety data more difficult. 
Third, the patients exposed to Cerebyx tended to fall into one of two 
categories: 1) seriously ill patients with status epilepticus or pending 
neurosurgery and 2) relatively stable patients with epilepsy. The net 
effect of this is that the safety data from one group cannot really be 
merged with the other. 
Normal volunteer studies were in general limited to escalating IV 
"loading" doses. Since the population of normal volunteers is relatively 
homogeneous, I believe it provides important information on rate-related 
adverse events, making some comparisons between Cerebyx and Dilantin 
treated subjects possible. For inetance, orie 1.mique advP.rse event that 
) occurs with Cerebyx is a sensation of generalized itching or tingling 
which is variously coded as pruritus or paresthesia. In the normal 
volunteer studies, this phenomenon can be seen to be rate-related for both 
Cerebyx and Dilantin, but with a much higher incidence with Cerebyx at 
bioequivalent rates of administration. 
Similarly, in the normal volunteer studies, injection site pain and 
injection site reaction are saen to be rate-related for IV Dilantin and 
occur only rarely for Cerebyx at any rate. 
The sponsor has proposed use of Cerebyx for up to 14 days. Hoy.iever, only 
a few patients were sxposad for longer than 5 days. I believe labe:ling 
should reflect the database with use allowed for 5 days or less. 
For labeling purposes, the sponsor proposes to present adverse event data 
separately for the 3 controlled trials. Since the AE profiles in these 
trials only reflect the population studied (seriously ill neurosurgery 
patients vs stable epilepsy patients) and since the standard deviation 
around any point estimate from a given triai mu.st be exceedingly large, 
would argue to discard these tables from labeling and bring forward the 
descriptive list of AEs in the parenteral Dilantin labeling. 
Finally, the sponsor has not fully addressed the unique adverse event of 
pruritus/paresthesia seen with Cerebyx. In particular, the ISS often uses 
descriptive language to the effect that this AE was "usually transient." 
In my review, I could not ascertain the outcome of all cases of this AE. I 
found no specific mention of a case of pruritus/paresthesia that 
persisted, but I would reque~t the sponsor to directly address the question 
of reversibility of this AE. The second safety update (November 1995) 
added 100 individual exposures to the high-dose, high-rate experience 
with Cerebyx and confirmed the frequent occurrence of pruritus in that 
situation. The sponsor could provide more information on the experience 
of these individuals with the sensory disturbance. 
Conclusions: 
Cerebyx is approvable. The following additional information is needed 
before a final approval action can be taken: 
1. The sponsor should provide a more complete description of the sensory 
4 disturbance caused by Cerebyx, to include the reversibility over time. 
2. Levels of phosphorus, magnesium, and free calcium should be measured 
at frequent timepoints during a 7 minute loading dose of Cerebyx and 
correlated with the character of the sensory disturbance. 
3. Formate levels should be measured after a loading dose of Cerebyx. 
Since the breakdown of formate is folate dependent, and because folate 
deficiency may be common in the population treated with Cerebyx 
(alcoholics and/or patients on chronic phenytoin therapy), some attempt 
should be made to measure formate levels in a folate deficient population 
after a loading dose of Cerebyx. 
The advantages of Cerebyx over parenteral Dilantin are: 
1. Given IV, it produces fewer local reactions, can be given in one-third 
the time of Dilantin, and may be more compatible with other IV solutions. 
2. It can be given iivl wiih predictable absorption and fewer local 
reactions. 
5 Peripheral Sensory Phenomena 
Background: We refused to file the original NDA submission for Cerebyx 
because of the minimal satety database accrued at high dose, high rate (SE 
dosing) infusions. The sponsor only slightly improved upon this at the 
time of the resubmission. Again, the first safety update only minimally 
improved upon this. The second safety update in late 1995 more than 
doubled the exposure to SE dosing. 
Looking only at the NDA submission, it became clear from normal 
volunteer studies that a dose-and rate-related sensory disturbance 
occurred with IV Cerebyx. In patient studies, the bulk of patients Gxposed 
to SE dosing were too obtunded to report sensory disturbances because 
they were in fact SE patients. Therefore, in patient studies, a dose-and 
rate-related sensory disturbance was less obvious. 
The second safety update in late 1996 included the results of Study 26 
performed from April 1995 to June 1995. Ninety patients were added to 
the SE dosing database. Half the patients were epilepsy patier:ts (not SE 
patients and not neurosurgery patients) and would not be expected to be 
obtunded. Likewise half the patients reported pruritus. Because we are 
not in possession of all the information from Study 26, we cannot 
ascertain the exact proportion of patients who were alert enough io report 
sensory disturbances. It is possible, given the information provided, to 
assume that all awake patients ir Study 26 experienced some degree of 
sensory disturbance; it is also possible that only half did. 
These were not trivial disturbances. The infusion was interrupted or 
discontinued for 13/44 (30%) patients experiencing pruritus. The 
intensity was rated severe for 6/44 (14%) patients; moderate for 17/44 
(39%) patients; and mild for the remainder. 
The mean onset time was 2 minutes for these 44 patients. By the time of 
follow-up, outcome was unknown for 1 /44 patients. Resolution of sensory 
symptoms is reported for all the rest. Because time-to-resolution is 
referenced to end of infusion, and because we are told that infusions were 
slowed or stopped because of pruritus in a third of patients, we cannot 
determine what happens in the absence of altered rate and time of infusion. It sounds like most patients im:-Jrove within 5-10 minutes o: 
stopping the infusion (12-17 rr,;nutes from start of infusion, assuming the 
infusion is given over the prescribed 7 minutes). A fourth of patients have 
some aegree of distrJrbance beyond this point (median, 1 hour). 
The second safety update also mentioned the results of Study 27, a 16-
subject PK and safety study. 75% of these normal volunteers experienced 
pruritus; 75% of these normal volunteers experienced p .1thesia. Four of 
the 16 subjects (25%) reported "severe" pruritus. 
Significance: Just based on what we know about this phenomenon, it is 
clear that the natural history of the disturbance· must be elucidated more 
clearly in order to provide for the safe use of this drug. For instance, the 
intensity of symptoms for those patients who experience symptoms 
beyond one hour of dosing has not been provided to us. Do some patients 
have severe pruritus for days or do only mild symptoms persist oeyond one 
hour ? Since many patients who receive IV loading with Cerebyx will not 
need rapid loading, labeling will need to reflect a rate for those patients 
which results in minimal discomfort. 
Also, could the pathophysiology that underlies the sensory disturbances 
with SE dosing of Cerebyx herald some more serious pathology ? 
In awake patients treated with SE dosing of Cerebyx, patient reporting of 
sensory disturbance could lead to lowering of rate. In obtunded patients, 
this margin of safety has been removed. 
Example of Foscavir (foscarnet): Foscavir is an example of a drug 
where the onset of sensory disturbance does herald more serious 
problems, specifically with hypocaicernia. Foscavir was developed for IV 
administration for the t.-eatment of CMV retinitis in the mid-1980s. Early 
on it became clear that many patients experienced distal and perioral 
paresthesias, tetany, and seizures. The constellation of symptoms and 
signs was identical to that seen with hypocalcernia and, in fact, total 
serum calcium levels were low in some patients. Cases of fatal 
hypocalcemia have been reported with this drug. 
Experience with Foscavir has demonstrated that the labeled loading 
infusion may cause decreases in ionized free calcium even though total 
7 serum calcium remains normal., ,2 The mechanism of this ionized 
hypocalcemia is believed to be chelation of free calcium by foscarnet 
itself (structurally appearing as a phosphate moiety with a carboxyl group 
substituted for an oxygen). Foscarnet is excreted unchanged in the urine, 
presumably carrying calcium with it. There is no evidence that foscarnet 
is broken down to phosphate, and there is no evidence of phosphate 
precipitating out of solution with calciu n. While foscarnet itself is toxic 
to renal tubule cells, there is no evidence of nephrocalcinosis (deposition 
of calcium-phosphate precipitates in the kidney) or other sett tissue 
calcium deposition. 
The current labeling for Foscavir states (WARNINGS; Mineral and 
Electrolytf. Imbalance) "Therefore, patients should be advised to report 
symptoms of low ionized calcium such as perioral tingling, numbness in 
the extremities arid paresthesias. Physicians should be prepared to treat 
these as well as severe manifestations of electrolyte abnormalities such 
as tetany and se'zures. The rate of Foscavir infusion may affect the 
transient decrease in ionized calcium. Slowing the rate may decrease or 
prevent symptoms." 
Possible Mechanisms of Cerebyx-lnduced Sensory Disturbance: 
There are m.:1ny ways that Cerebyx could cause sensory symptoms. Any 
explanation has to account for a lack of symptoms at 
bioequivalent dosing regimens of parenteral Dilantin. Perhaps IV 
tosphenyt::iin (the parent compound) alone causes sensory disturbance. Or 
perhaps IV tosphenytoin results in a distribution of phenytoin in tissues 
that is different from the distribution that results from pa•enteral 
Dilantin. Formate and phosi:hate are the two byproducts of tosphenytoin 
metabolism. Either one of these could cause transient sensory 
disturbances either directly or via an intermediate step. 
A. Formate: Note that several steps are necessary in the metabolism ot 
Cerebyx before the formation of formate. Given the almost immediate

8 onset of the sensory phenomenon, it seems unlikP.ly that formate would be 
the causative agent. 
B. Phosphate: When I investigated the degree of phosphate loading with 
Cerebyx, I was impressed. Approximately 1 gram of phosphorus is 
ingested each day in an average United States diet. Of this, 700mg is 
absorbed. In comparison, an IV loading dose of Cerebyx includes 75mg of 
phosphorus; the SE dosing regimen would introduce the fosphenytoin over 
7 minutes. One outdated regimen for treating hypercalcemia3 was to give 
phosphates IV at a dose of 20 to 30 mg of elemental phosphorus per kg 
over 12 to 16 hours. In a 70kg person, this would result in 1 OOmg/hr. A 
stated hazard of this therapy was extraskeletal calcifications, including 
nephrocalcinosis with resulting renal failure. 
C. Sponsor's Comments on Mechanisms: The sponsor first addresses 
underlying mechanisms of these sensory disturbances from Cerebyx on the 
third-to-the-last page of the second safety update. "Although the 
underlying mechanism of fosphenytoin-induced pruritus and paresthesia is 
unknown, similar symptoms have also been reported for other phosphate­
ester prodrugs and for foscarnet." The "other phosphate-ester prodrugs" 
referenced by the sponsor are Decadron and Hydrocortone. 
Curiously, the character and location of the sensory disturbance described 
for Decadron and Hydrocortone matches the dominant description in 
Cerebyx-treated subjects. With all 3 agents, patients describe a burning 
or itching which localizes primarily to the groin area. 
By my calculation, IV loading doses of Decadron and Hydrocortone provide 
1 /20th-1/10th the elemental phosphorus provided by a loading dose of 
Cerebyx. Therefore, assuming phosphate is the common link, it would not 
be surprising that Cerebyx would produce more severe burning and itching. 
Calcium Metabolism: Calcium is usually measured in the clinic as total 
serum calcium (normal 9-10.4mg/dL). About 50% of serum calcium is 
ionized and 10% is complexed with citrate. phosphate, bicarbonate, and 
lactate. The rest (40%) is protein-bound, mainly to albumin. The 
concentration of serum calcium is reflected in the proportion: (Ca) x 
3Aenal and Electrolyte Disorders Schrier (editor). Little, Brown and 
Company, 1976; p 198. 
Q [Phosphate]/[Calcium-Phosphate]. The normal range for phosphorus is 3-
4.Smg/dl. The product of [Ca] (mg/dl) x [Ph] (mg/dl) therefore normally 
approaches 50. When the product approaches 60-70, most textbooks raise 
concern about precipitation with resultant soft tissue calcification, to 
include nephrocalcinosis. 
By weight, phosphorus represents 15/406 or 3-4% of fosphenytoin so that 
a loading dose of Cerebyx delivers 75mg phosphorus. If this load 
remained in the vascular space, the serum phosphorus could theoretically 
rise by 2mg/dl, thereby raising the calcium-phosphorus product to 70. 
This would drive the equilibrium toward calcium-phosphate and tend to 
tower calcium. As with Foscavir, the ionized free calcium would probably 
reflect this drop better than total serum calcium values. 
Note, however, that hypocalcemia typically causes a tingling sensation 
around the face and in the hands, not a burning in the groin as we have 
seen in many Cerebyx patients. 
Although the sponsor has not acknowledged this theoretical concern, it 
must have crossed their minds. The second safety update briefly 
summarizes an open-label safety and PK study performed in June ·1995 
which incorporated 16 healthy subjects, each given a single SE dose of 
Cerebyx (Study 27). lri reviewing individual lab listings fer these 
subjects. I notice that 9/ 16 subjec·ts had ionized free calcium levels 
performed at 18 minutes, while 5 of the same subjects had ionized free 
calcium levels performed at 8 minutes. None of the levels are remarkable, 
either when viewed as absolute values or as change from baseline. 
Certainly these measurements are not comparable to those reported for 
Foscavir. However, note: that the SE dose of Cerebyx is delivered over 7 
minutes. With only 5 ionized free calcium level checked at 8 minu!es and 
the rest performed at 18 minutes, I do not believe we can rule out the 
occurrence of a transient hypocalcemia during the 7 minute infusion. 
Further, the clinical status of these 5 (or 9) subjects is not stated. Were 
they subiects with or without pruritus ? 
In the absence of more data on ionized free calcium, I reviewed total 
calcium levels in Study 26. Note that, aside from the 8 and 18 minute 
clinical labs in Study 27, I am not aware of clinical labs in any other 
studies being performed early enough to be informative on this subject. 
Still, 25% of Cerebyx-treated patients in Study 26 are listed with low 
10 calcium levels. Since this does not differ from the Dilantin-treated 
group, I would doubt it is important. 
A review of all deaths and serious AEs in Study 26 raises no particular 
concerns regarding other manifestations of hypocalcemia. In particular, 
do not s 'le any description of seizures occurring in proximity to Cerebyx 
infusions, cardiac rhythm disturbance, or tetany. In fact, the profile of 
serious AEs appears roughly the same for Cerebyx and Dilantin treated 
patients in Study 26. Again, though, patients in Study 26 "had near 
normal levels of consciousness to report adverse events and 
infusion tolerance" (2nd safety update,p35) which may . not 
mirror the SE population most likely to receive the SE doses of 
Cerebyx. Patients in Study 26 could report sensory symptoms 
early and thereby cause their rate to be lowered. 
Summary: 
1. The natural history of the sensory disturbance caused by Cerebyx at SE 
dosing has not been fully characterized. In particular, we do not know if 
the intensity (severe for many) correlated with duration (many hours for 
some), especially in the absence of dose and rate reductions. 
Relevant to this last point is that the number of known obtunded patients 
given SE dosing regimens remains small. (We don't know the level of 
consciousness for all Study 26 patients.) For these patients, the longterm 
follow-up was short, 3-5 days by protocol. More obtunded patients, given 
SE dosing without rate reductions and followed for longer periods of time, 
would add a margin of safety to the Cerebyx experie11ce. (Perhaps Study 
26 contains some of this information.) Pertinent to this, the patients in 
Study 16 who were given the SE dosing regimen could have their status at 
the 3-5 day visit teased out and presented separately. Patient 2 at Center 
8 has pruritus beginning on day 2, continuing, and not yet recovered, but 
the duration of follow-up is not clearly stated. The "mild itching feeling" 
reported for Patient 22, Center 9 in Study 15 on Day 4, just after 
experiencing post-ictal psychosis is intriguing along these lines. 
2. One very plausible theory for the sensory disturbance (one which the 
sponsor has begun to investigate in Study 27) is a drug-induced transient 
drop in ionized free calcium. I believe this needs Jo be investigated more 
l l comprehensively, orior to drug approval. This could be accomplished by 
checking free calcium levels more frequently, at earlier time points, and 
in more patients. There may be value in also checking magnesium levels 
at the same time, since magnesium is another example of a divalent 
cation. Sensory symptoms could be correlated with calcium and 
magnesium levels. (Indeed, presenting free calcium levels for 9/16 
subjects in Study 27 raises the concern that values are not presented for 
the subjects with sensory disturbances.) 
Relevant to the this, the sponsor could measure serum phosphate levels in 
closer proximity to the infusion since phosphate levels would predict 
potential for hypocalcemia. 
12 Formate 
For each mmole of Cerebyx administered, one mmole of formate is 
produced. Therefore, a loading dose of Cerebyx delivers about 5 mmoles of 
formate to the individual. Assuming all the formate stayed within the 
circulation (5 liters), a maximal theoretical increase of i MMOUL in 
background formate levels could occur. This was recognized at the time 
the IND for fosphenytoin was first filed in 1986 (see the pharm/tox 
review of Dr. Fitzgerald from 1986). 
In 1986, the sponsor · -at that time) measured formate levels in 4 
subjects administered a small loading dose of fosphenytoin over 30 
minutes (hali as much fos as constitutes a current loading dose, given 
over a greater time interval). Background levels were 0.5 MMOUL and did 
not increase. Since then, formate levels have not been measured in any 
human studies of Cerebyx. 
Given the measured background levels in that study and the maximal 
theoretical increase, the maximal theoretical level that could be achieved 
after a Cerebyx loading dose is 1.5 MMOUL. 
In monkey studies referenced by Dr. Fisher in the current pharm/tox 
review, formate levels as low as 7 MMOUL could cause the characteristic 
optic nerve lesions of formate toxicity (implied, but not clearly stated, is 
that levels below 7 MMOUL did not cause the lesion in the monkey 
studies). 
There are ongoing investigations into the mechanism of methanol toxicity, 
due in part to interest in methanol as an automotive fuel. Methanol is 
converted to formaldehyde and then to formate. Investigators have found 
that rats. normally resistant to methanol toxicity, can be made sensitive 
13 to methanol toxicity by creating a state of folate deficiency.1,2 This 
folate-reduced (FR) rat model has been the subject of some recent studies 
on methanol toxicity. In this model, 2.5-3.0 MMOUL formate probably 
represents the NOEL (personal communication from Robert Louis-Ferdinand 
to Dr. Ed Fisher). Formate levels of 7-10 MMOUL are associated with 
changes in the electroretinogram of the FR rat and with the histological 
abnormalities in the optic nerve. 
In the NDA, preclinical studies were performed in non-primates which are 
not susceptible to formate toxicity unless they are made folate deficient. 
Formate levels were not measured in these studies. 
The human clinical literature on methanol toxicity includes reported 
formate levels in patients who died, suffered visual loss, and who 
survived without deficits.3,4 Formate levels as low as 2-4 MMOUL are 
reported in some fatalities. Unfortunately, the timing of these levels in 
relation to the methanol exposure are not always clear. Some reported 
formate levels may be peak levels while others are trough levels. Levels 
of 1 O MMOUL and above do seem to consistently be associated with poor 
outcomes. Levels below 10 have outcomes that vary from complete 
recovery to death. Based on the information from monkey and FR rat 
studies, I believe the human levels below 10 in association with poor

14 outcomes may simply represent trough levels in patients who experience 
much higher levels at other times in their clinical course. 
Folate-deficient populations are a topic of some discussion in the 
literature on methanol toxicity. Alcoholism, pregnancy, and chronic 
phenytoin therapy are all states known to be associated with folate 
deficiency. Treatments that alter folate metabolism, such as dietary 
manipulation, nitrous oxide, and methotrexate, have been shown to modify 
methanol toxicity in monkeys and rats. Methanol-derived levels of 
formate are higher in folate-deficient monkeys than in normal monkeys 
after similar exposures to methanol.S These aut'1ors found that elevations 
in formate levels after very high inhalation exposures, whether in normal 
or folate-d.::!'-::ient monkeys, were only a fraction of background formate 
levels. 
Acidosis: Severe methanol toxicity is associated with a severe acidosis, 
as well as high formate levels. To quote one paper on methanol poisoning, 
"l=ormate accumulation occurs in a manner reciprocal to the depletion of 
bicarbonate."4 When searching the line listings for Study 27 in the recent 
safety update, I found fairly complete data on bicarbonate levels from the 
16 subjects given loading doses. These levels were collected at regular 
30 minute intervals. For the 16 subjects entered, many of them showed 
some small decrement in bicarb with the nadir occurring at different 
times for different subjects. The biggest decrement occurred for subject 
16, with a baseline bicarb of 25.4 and an end-of-infusion reading of 18.6. 
(19-26MMOUL is given as the normal range.) It is unclear if these small 
decrements represent normal variability over time or some consistent 
effect of the infusions. 
I wonder if the decrements seen in bicarbonate in Study 27 might be used 
as markers for alevations in formate levels. Again, the sponsor has not 
specifically called attention to the existence of the bicarbonate data or to 
its signilic?.nce. (It is not clearly stated why the bicarb levels were 
checked in the first place.)

15 Labeling for Cerebyx will have to reflect the fact that patients with 
status epilepticus usually have an underlying metabolic acidosis, the 
degree of which varies with the severity of the status and the cause of 
the status (see Patient 11, Study 16; multiple drug overdose), and that 
Cerebyx may add to this derangement. 
Anion Gap: If there is a transient decrease in bicarbonate in the absense 
of a change in sodium and chloride, we have defined an increase in the 
anion gap. Formation of formate and/or phosphate loading could increase 
the anion gap. For subject 16 in Study 27, the anion gap at the end of the 
infusion was 16 with a normal of 8-16. 
Sensory Symptoms: In the animal toxicology studies, Dr. Fisher has not 
seen any evidence of severe sensory symptoms such as writhing. If the 
animals experience the same phosphate load as humans (or slightly 
greater), and if phosphate is the origin of sensory symptoms, some painful 
behavior would have been expected. Since we know that formate 
metabolism is one area where these non-primates differ from humans in 
Cerebyx-processing, the question arises whether formate accumulation in 
humans could be contributing to the sensory disturbance. 
Summary: 
1. Formate levels have not been measured in humans after a loading dose 
of Cerebyx. 
2. Formate levels have not been u1easured in folate-deficient humans 
after a loading dose of Cerebyx. Introduction

Resubmission of NDA 
First safety update 
Second safety update 
The basis for the refuse to file action in Seple.!'f!ber 1994 was the small 
number of patients and volunteers treated with Fos at a rate of 150 
mg/min PE. Only 4 pis with status epilepticus had been treated at that 
rate while about 20 normal volunteers had been treated at that rate. 
The sponsor continued to enroll pts in an ongoinp status epilepticus study 
after the NOA was filed. On the basis of the increased numbers of pis 
treated as well as a recalculation of infusion rates for some previousiy­
treated pts, it was agreed that the sponsor would resubmit the NOA in 
1995. 
B. Material Utilized in Review 
The NOA dated July 14, 1994 and received July 15, 1994 included 93 
volumes. Volumes 1.1, 1.47-1.72, and 1.89-1.92 from that submission 
were used for purposes of this review. 
17 After the refusal to file, a resubmission dated February 22, 1995 and 
received February 23, 1995 was submitted. The resubmission included 15 
volumes. Volumes 3.1 and 3.9-3.12 from the resubmission were 
frequently used for purposes of this review. Those volumes included a 
rewritten Integrated Summary of Safety and rewritten study reports for 
Studies 982-15, 982-21, and 982-16. 
The 4-month safety update dated June 22, 1995 and received June 23, 
1995 was also used for this review. At my request, Tables 5 and 6 from 
the safety update were changed by the sponsor and submitted September 
14, 1995. 
The FDA Biopharm Review is also integral to the review of this NOA. 
C. Background 
Fosphenytoin Sodium (Fos) is the disodium phosphate ester of 3-
hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin. It is a prodrug of phenytoin. It is 
rapidly and completely converted to phenytoin in vivo by ubiquitous 
phosphatases. Because of the phosphate ester, 150 mg Fos yields 100 mg 
phenytoin sodium. In this report. doses of Fos and dose rates of Fos will 
always be expressed as phenytoin equivalents (PE) as opposed to actual mg 
Fos. 
According to the sponsor, the presumed advantages of Fos over parenteral 
phenytoin are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• pH 8.8 as opposed to pH 12 of Dilantin 
freely soluble and stable in common IV tluids 
can be used IM 
shorter administration times; can be given at 150 mg/min while 
Dilantin is limited lo 50 mg/min 
minimal tissue trauma at injection site (presumably due to lower 
pH 
no cardiovascular toxicity including hypotension 
While shorter administration times could be a distinct advantage in 
emergent situations, it will be seen below that this is actually a 
necessity in 0rder to meet bioequivalence standards based on free 
phenytoin levels after IV administration. 
l8 The relative local injection site toxicities and cardiovascular toxicities 
of Fos and parenteral Dilantin remain a topic for this review. 
In fact, this NOA is unique in many ways. First, there are no controlled 
trials to support the efficacy of Fos. The "controlled trials" submitted 
were really not designed to show a difference between treatment groups 
on a protocol-specified efficacy outcome. The majority of patients 
studied were not having seizures, but were only at risk for seizures for 
one reason or another. 
Secondly, the bioequivalence data submitted in support of this application 
really only applies to the isolated instance of IV loading. To my 
knowledge, no bioequivalence data for IV maintenance dosing, IM loading, 
or IM maintenance dosing has been submitted. 
Thirdly, the limited safety databane submitted in support of this 
application can be partitioned in two ways. The first way partitions the 
data by route of administration, IV versus IM. (In addition to the systemic 
toxicities that could be part and parcel of the route-determined 
bioavailability, there exists the route-specific local toxicities.) The 
second way partitions the data by loading versus maintenance dosing. 
While the safety of a loading dose also speaks to the safety of a 
maintenance dose by the same route of administration, the converse is not 
true. Because of this last point, I have divided the patient safety database 
as seen in the table below. Subjects in normal volunteer studies are not 
included in this table. Since ahr.ost all normal volunteer studies (n=148 
Fas-exposed subjects) were single loading dose studies, these studies 
would be expected to add information primarily to the IV loading group. 
Loading Maintenance Loading Plus 
Maintenance 
I---~ 
IV Route 1 81 88 1 81 
IM Route 178 297 357 
Note that the definition of "Loading" for purposes of such a table can be 
complicated. We could look only at the "bioequivalent" IV loading dose, 
19 with a very precise rate and total dose. Or we could include anyone with a 
total dose of 20mg/kg PE given over an hour or less (a subacute loading 
dose). Or we could include anyone with the •bioequivalent" rate even if 
the total dose was as low as 10mg/kg PE. Interestingly enough, for the IM 
route, a bioequivalent loading do11e cannot be defined because parenteral 
Dilantin is rarely given IM. The systemic bioavailability of IM Fos is 
reported to be 1 00% 
0. Proposed Directions for Use 
The proposed labeling seeks an indication of Fos for short-term parenteral 
use for up to 14 days: 
o for status epilepticus 
o for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures in pa!ients with 
epilepsy or in neurosuigical patients 
o as a substitute for oral phenytoin when oral administration is 
not feasible 
The Dosage and Administration Section of the proposed labeling describes 
4 situations tor use: 
1. IV loading in status epilepticus 
2. IM or IV loading for treatment or prophylaxis 
3. IM or IV use for maintenance therapy 
4. IM or IV use for temporary substitution for oral Dilantin 
For status epilepticus, "the standard loading dose is 22.5 to 30 mg/kg 
(15-20 PE) infused at 150 to 225 mg/min (100-150 PE) in adults ... with 
vital signs ... and cardiac rhythm (ECG) monitored during and immediately 
after the infusion ... Cerebyx (19.5-25.5 mg/kg or 13-17 PE) administered 
at 225 mg/min (150 PE) is bioequivalent to an equim.)lar dose of Dilantin 
administered parenterally at 50 mg/min." 
Further, "Guidelines for the treatment of status epilepticus suggest that 
patients still in status epilepticus after a phenytoin loading dose of 20 
mg/kg may receive additional loading doses of 5 mg/kg up to a maximal 
dose of 30 mg/kg. Based on these guidelines, patients treated with 
Cerebyx still in status epilepticus after a Cerebyx loading dose of 30 
mg/kg (20mg PE) may receive additional Cerebyx loading doses of 7 .5 
mg/kg (5mg PE) up to a maximal Cerebyx dose of 45 mg/kg (30mg PE)." 
20 The sponsor has studied the loading doses above and, baaed on free 
phenytoin concentrations, has found that Cerebyx infusions at 225 
mg/min (150mg PE) are bioequivalent to standard Dilantin loading doses. 
However, if the standard of care for refractory status includes 
additional boluses, the sponsor has not studied the PK of Cerebyx at these 
higher doses.

21 PK Studies 
IM Fos Maintenance 
The bioavailability of phenytoin, given as IM Fos, is 100%. In contrast, the 
bioavailability of phenytoin, given as Dilantin Kapseals is 90%. 
Bioequivalence Studies for Emergent IV Loading 
Study 18 was a 4-way crossover study of different doses and infusion 
rates. Tl1e concentration-time curves depicted in the publication of this 
study depict nearly superimposable curves for 1200 mg given at 100 
mg/min and 150 mg/min. While not designed as a bioequivalence study, it 
appears that these 2 infusion rates would be bioequivalent and, 
additionally, both result in similar rise times for free phen~toin 
concentrations. 
Data from a second published PK study shows Fos at 100 mg/min to have a 
slower rise time of free phenytoin concentration than Fos at 150 mg/min; 
the Cmax and Al!Cs appear similar otherwise. This study was designed as 
a bioequivalence study: Only Fos at 150 mg/min was bioequivalent to 
Dilantin at 50 mg/min. The rise time of free phenytoin levels was steeper 
for Fos, resulting in maxima! levels about 5-7 mi.1utes faster for Fos than 
Dilantin. 
Safety Concerns for Emergent IV Loading in Light of PK Data 
As described in later sections, there is minimal safety data for IV Fos 
given at a rate of 150 mg/min PE. The safety experience widens 
considerably if 100 mg/min is used as a cutoff. 
22 The 2 PK studies present discrepant data. In one, 100 vs 150 appear 
equivalent with similar rise times for free phenytoin levels. In the other, 
only 150 is bioequivalent to Dilantin 50 mg/min. 
The rise time for free phenytoin levels is significantly faster in one PK 
study compared to Dilantin. In the other study, the rise time is less steep 
and is similar tor both 100 and 150 mg/min infusion rates. If the rise 
time is steeper with Fos 150 mg/min than for Dilantin at 50 mg/min, the 
potential exists for increased cardiovascular toxicity with Fos than with 
Dilantin. The only way to resolve the safety issue would be to 
conduct a large enough safety study powered to detect , a 
difference between parenteral Dilantin and Fos, given at 
50mg/min and 150mg/min respectively. A study with pts 
randomized to these 2 infusion rates has been designed by the sponsor to 
begin in April 1995, but it is unlikely that this study will have the power 
to detect a difference between the two drugs with respect to this AE. 
23 Safety 
Preclinical Safety Profile (see Dr. Fisher's review) 
The toxicological profile of Fos was essentially the same as that of 
phenytoin. Acute IV toxicity studies we•e conducted in mice, rats, 
rabbits, and dogs. Multidose toxicity studies were conducted by both the 
IV and IM routes in rats and dogs. The IV studies were 4 weeks in duration 
while the IM studies were 13 weeks in duration. 
Special studies of local ti:>sue irritation were conducted. Fos produced 
significantly less venous and perivascular irritation than phenytoin at 
equimoiar concentrations. Local irritation after IM injection of Fos to 
rabbits was significantly lower than after IM phenytoin. 
The cardiovascular effects of equimolar doses of phenytoin and Fos were 
comparable following IV bolus injection to anesthetized female dogs. Any 
less pronounced effects seen after Fos administration are presumed to be 
due to the lower peak blood levels of phenytoin resulting from its 
administration (22 vs 49 mcg/ml). 
The formation of formaldehyde after Fos administration raises a 
theoretical safety concern. The theoretical maximum dose of 
formaldehyde (assuming complete, instantaneous conversion) after an IV 
dose of 2100 mg Fos (proposed maximum human dose) based on a 1:1 molar 
ratio would be 5.17 mmol or about 0.1 mmol/kg (3 mg/kg) for a 50 kg 
person. Using modeling techniques, peak formaldehyde levels were 
predicted to be approximately 0.18 mmol/L, with concentrations declining 
to background levels (0.027-0.068 mmol/L) within 20 minutes. Plasma 
formate levels measured in 4 healthy volunteers following administration 
of 1200 mg of Fos by IV infusion over 30 min were not significantly 
different fr0m those observed in a placebo group or from baseline levels 
24 (25 mg/L). 
Dr. Fisher has reviewed the genetic toxicity and reproductive toxicity 
studies. Developmental toxicity seen in rats given Fos is consistent with 
that previously reported with phenytoin. 
Fos was clastogenic in Chinese hamster lung cells. Phenytoin was 
reportedly not clastogenic in previous studies with CHO cells. One 
explanation for this discrepancy is that the clastogenicity of Fos is due to 
formaldehyde formation. 
1.0 Exposure 
849 volunteers and patients have participated in all Fos studies included 
in the NDA. These volunteers and patients account for 942 exposures to 
some study drug (Fos, phenytoin, or placebo) if patients in crossover 
studies are counted as 2 separate exposures. 
736 volunteers or patients have been exposed to Fos, including 148 
volunteers and 588 patients. 534 patients were part of the completed 
clinical studies while an additional 54 patients were part of ongoing 
Study 16 (status epilepticus). 
The sponsor's list of all studies is attached. 
Note that almost all 148 volunteers in the early dose-escalation and PK 
studies received single 1V doses of Fos. 
Two of the studies in patients were unusual in their dosing regimens. In 
study 005, patients received half of their maintenance oral dose of 
phenytoin as IV Fos and the other half as IM Fos. Study 10 was an isotope 
study.

With the exception of 6 patients in Study 16 (status epilepticus), all 
patients were 16 years of age or older. Study 16 included 6 patients 
between the ages of 5 and 10 years.

Duration of exposure by route of administration (see sponsor's 
Figure 4): 
Approximately 200 patients received IM Fos for 5 days, but only about 20 
patients received IM Fos for 6 days or greater. IM exposure to Fos was 
heavily influenced by Study 13 which was designed as a 5-day study. 
Approximately 60 patients received IV Fos for 4 days, but only about 18 
patients received IV Fos for 5 days or greater. IV exposure to Fos was 
dependent on Study 15 where there was a protocol-specified option to 
switch to PO Dilantin after 3 days at the investigators' discretion. 
Dose and Rate (see sponsor's Figure 7 which incorporates both 
volunteers and patients): 
The total dose given obviously depended on whether the dose was designed 
as a loading dose or a maintenance dose. 
The rate of administration for IV dosing was generally about 50 mg/min ± 
20 except where specifically pushed higher to the bioequivalent rates 
necessary in &talus (150 mg/min). 
2.0 Volunteer Studies 
148 unique volunteers were exposed to Fos. Some of these individuals 
may have received more than one exposure to Fos. As mentioned above, 
most of these volunteers received single IV doses as part of dose­
escalation or PK studies. Sponsor's Table 3 represents the number of 
unique volunteers exposed to Fos, Di1antin, and placebo in these studies. 
2.1 Deaths 
There were no deaths in volunteer studies. 
2.2 Serious AEs and Discontinuations 
There were 3 serious AEs reported in volunteer studi,~s. 2 were on Fos and ~ .

1 was on Dilantin. The patient narratives for all 3 patients are included 
below. The first Fos volunteer experienced progressive bradycardia 
leading to asystole for 23 seconds. D1Jring the asystole, the volunteer 
experienced 15 seconds of tonic-clonic movement. Because of subsequent 
abnormal electrophysiologic tet~ting, the case was deemed unrelated to 
study drug. The subject had rnceived 500mg of a planned 750mg bolus at 
150mg/min. 
The second Fos patient had hypotension and syncope after receiving 650mg 
of a planned 750mg bolus at 50mg/min. Bradycardia accompanied the 
event. 
The Dilantin subject experience'd hypotension after receiving 600ng of 
Dilantin at 50mg/min. 
All 3 events seem most consistent with vasovagal reactions. 
The classification of "discontinuations" or "withdrawals" would be 
somewhat uninformative for these volunteer studies since rrost of the 
studies were single dose IV studies. Nevertheless, there were 3 
discontinuations. The 2 previously mentioned Fos serious AEs account for 
2 of the 3 discontinuations. The third discontinuation was a Dilantin 
treated subject who developed a wandering cardiac pacemaker during 
infusion. 
2.3 Severe AEs 
Severe AEs were reported in 5 Fos subjects and 3 Dilantin subjects. 1/5 
severe Fas reactions was described as a serious AE; the other 4 severe 
AEs were: ataxia, stupor, tinnitus. and pruritus. The 3 severe Dilantin 
AEs were: injection site pain in 2 subjects and hypotension in 1 subject. 
2.4 All AEs 
The sponsor has chosen to present the AE data relative to the number of 
exposures vs the number of subjects. For this reason, the denominators 
differ from Table 3 above in that there were 211 Fos exposures in 148 
subjects. The number of exposures = number of subjects for ;:>lc.cebo and 
Dilantin subjects. Sponsor's Table 6 shows all AEs, as well as those 
characterized as associated with test drug.

The most common AEs for Fos were: 
Dizziness 38% 
Paresthesia 32% 
Nystagmus 25% 
Tinnitus 14% 
Pruritus 14% 
Headache 12% 
Ear disorder 10% 
Except for paresthesia and pruritus, the incidence for all the above AEs 
was equal to or less than that for Dilantin. 
Injection site pain was 2% for Fos vs 30% for Dilantin. Injection site 
reaction was 2% for Fos vs 13% for Dilantin. 
2.5 Rate-related AEs After IV Administration 
Some AEs were rate-related after IV administration in both Fos and 
Dilantin treated subjects. More informative, however, are the 
discrepancies between Fos and Dilantin treated subjects, situations where 
an AE was clearly rate-related for one treatment but not the other. 
Taste perveri;ion was rate-related for Fos, reaching 19% of Fos subjects 
when Fos was administered at 100-150 mg/min, but did not occur at any 
rate for Dilantin administration. 
Likewise, pruritus was rate-related for Fos, reaching 38% of Fos subjects 
when Fos was administered at 100-150 mg/min, but only occurred in a 
single Dilantin-treated subject. 
Paresthesia were rate-related for Dilantin as follows: 
0/12 cases at 15 mg/min or less 
0/14 cases at 15-30 mg/min 
11/30 (37%) cases at 30-50 mg/min 
Paresthesia were also rate-related for Fos as follows: 
3/54 (6%) at 15 mg/min or less 
3/17 (18%) at 15-30 mg/min 
18/62 (29%) at 30-50 mg/min 
43 .. 
23/35 (66%) at 50-100 mg/min 
21/31 (68%) at 100-150 mg/min 
Note that at bioequivalent rates, 37% Oilantin subjects vs 68% Fos 
subjects reported paresthesia. Of course, the total dose was not 
controlled for in these comparisons. 
2.6 Dose-related AEs After IV Administration 
No new trends over those reported in the rate-related AE section are 
obvious here. Taste perversion and pruritus increase with dose (as 
opposed to rate) in the absence of any significant number of events in 
Dilantin subjects at any dose. 
2. 7 Clinical Labs 
The sponsor reports no clinically significant changes after Fos 
adminif.tration. Recall that most exposures in volunteers were single 
dose exposures. 
2.8 Injection Site Reactions 
Sponsor's Table 10 summarizes injection site reactions for the volunteer 
studies. Based on 102 Fos exposures and 39 placebo exposures, the profile 
of reactions for Fos and placebo are not significantly different. 97% of 
exposures in both groups resulted in none-mild reactions. For the 
Dilantin-exposures (n=32), 15% resulted in moderate reactions and 6% 
resulted in severe reactions. 
When rate-relatedness was examined, up to 23% of high-rate Dilantin 
exposures resulted in reactions. Reactions were not rate-related with 
Fos. Up to 43% of high-rate Dilantin exposures resulted in injection site 
pain. Pain was not rate-related with Fos. 
2.9 Vital Signs 
The IS$ does not address vital signs 1n volunteer studies.

The great majority of data collected in normal volunteers is applicable to 
the IV bolus situation (at varying rates). in the categories severe AEs, all 
AEs, rate-related AEs, and dose-related AEs, there is a consistent trade­
ott between the occurrence of local injection site reactions and pain with 
IV Dilantin and the occurrence of generalized paresthesia and pruritus 
with IV Fos. 
Paresthesia are reported with IV Dilantin, but only at high rate or high 
dose. Even at high rate or high dose though, the incidence of paresthesia 
is less than expected for Dilantin given the incidence for Fos. Taste 
perversion is an additional AE that appeared for Fos subjects but not 
Dilantin subjects. 
The sponsor does not address the reversibility of Fos-associated 
paresthesia, pruritus, and taste perversion directly in the ISS. 
Statements are made to the effect that these 3 AEs tend to be limited to 
the post-infusion times. Whether some subjects continued with these AEs 
is not directly obvious from reading the ISS. .. 
3.0 Completed Studies in Patients 
534 patients participated in completed clinical studies. The breakdown of 
these 534 patients has been presented &bc.ve in "Sl'lclion 1.0 Exposure." 
In the ISS, the sponsor presents different cross-sectional views of AE 
data, but each is inadequate for not accounting for other relevant 
variables. For instance, a breakdown by route of administration does not 
account for whether the individual patients were given loading doses or 
maintenan~e doses. For this reason, I believe that only individual study 
reports &re interpretable. Even these present problems by not controlling 
for rate and dose in may circumstances (see individual study reviews). 
The appropriateness of combining results from different studies in 
patients even when ostensibly the same medications were given by the 
same route and same dosing regimen (loading vs maintenance) can be 
questioned. For instance, patients in Studies 15 and 21 received IV 
loading doses of Fos or Dilantin. But the AE profile for the Dilantin arms 
of the two trials differ significantly (see tables of common AEs from 
these 2 trials on following pages). One possible explanation is that one 
study was in neurosurgical patients and the other in epilepsy patients. 
In Study 21 in epilepsy patients, nystagmus, dizziness, vertigo, and ataxia 
are reported in 38%, 38%, 23%, and 15% of patients respectively. In Study 
15 in neurosurgery patients, the same AEs are reported in 14%, 11 %, 0%, 
and 7% of patients respectively. All these AEs would be more likely to be 
ascertained in an ambulatory, alert population like the epilepsy 
population. 
3.1 Ail AEs 
Sponsor's Table 12 presents all AEs occurring in patients in ccmpleted 
studies. Suffice it to say that no alarming safety concerns arise !n 
reviewinr, data presented this way. At the same time, no convincing 
advantages of Fos over Dilantin emerge. 
While in1ection site pain is reported in 1.5% of Fos patients and €.9% of 
Dilantin patients, the comparability of rate and dose of administration 
between groups is not obvious. Likewise, while injection site reaction is 
reported in 2.8% of Fos patients and 4.9% of Dilantin patients, the rates 
and doses may not be comparable. Note that when data is grouped as it is

here for all patients, the term "injection site" could apply to either IM or 
IV injection site ~ 
On page 48 of the ISS, the sponsor describes the experience with 
paresthesia and pruritus in more detail. For 13 patients treated with IV 
Fos, the investigator chose to manage the events by changing the infusion 
rate or administering medication (steroids or antihistamines). The 
number ot events after IM Fos is not stated here, but no interventions 
were utilized. One patient withdrew because of severe pruritus that 
occurred with severe allergic reaction (Pt 13, Study 13, Center 1 ). 
Also on page 48, the sponsor reports that in completed patient studies, 
discrepancies between Fos and Dilantin treated patients with regard to 
pruritus and paresthesia were not as great as in the normal volunteer 
studies. This fact is misleading because the 2 different comparative 
studies in patients report!.'d different experiences. With regard to 
paresthesia, Study 21 reported a 10% vs 0% incidence in paresthesia in 
favor of Dilantin. With regard to pruritus, Study 21 reported a 31 % vs 0% 
incidence in pruritus in li.wor of Dilantin. In short, in some patient 
studies, discrepancies in Fos and Dilantin treated subjects with regard to 
paresthesia and pruritus were as great as or 9re3tGr than those seen in 
the normal volunteer studies. 
3.2 Common AEs Within the Two Active-Control Trials 
The 2 active·control trials in the NDA differ in two respects: first, one 
had only an IV loading dose while the other had an IV load followed by IV 
maintenance dosing; second, one was in neurosurgery patients and one was 
in epilepsy patier.ts. 
When the 2 Dilantin-control trials (Studies 15 and 21) are looked at 
separately, the Magnitude of the discrepancies between Fos and Dilantin 
for certain AEs varies. 
Fr,r all studies combined, pruritus was reported in 5% Fo~ patients and 0% 
,Jilantin patients. In Study 15 (neurosurgery patients), pruritus was 
reported in 6% Fos patients and 0% Dilantin patients. But in Study 21 
(epilepsy patients), pruritus was reported in 31 % Fos patients vs 0% 
Dilantin patients.

Overall, in Study 21, the big differences in AEs between Fos and Oilantin 
occurred for pruritus (31 vs O %), paresthesia (1 O vs O %), neuropathy (8 
vs 0 %), and tremor (8 vs O %). 
Overall, in Study 15, the big differences in AEs between Fos and Dilantin 
occurred for pruritus (6 vs 0 %), increased reflexes (8 vs 0 %), and 
injection site reaction (7 vs 18 %). 
Note that injection site reactions were not unusual in Study 15 and 
demonstrated a difference between Fos and Dilantin. In Study 21, only a 
single injection site reaction was reported (it happened to be in a Fos 
patient) :>o that no difference between Fos and Dilantin was really 
demonstrated. In all likelihood, this difference between studies was 
because Study 21 was only a single dose study while Study 15 
incorporated a loading dose followed by several days of maintenance 
dosing. (Another alternative explanation is that the Dilantin rates in 
Study 21 wece lowered in 5 patients because of local pain, thereby 
decreasing the later emergence of injection site reactions in those 
patitrnts.) 
One might infer fr;:im the last paragraph that, for IV dosing, the advantage 
of Fos ave• Diiantin with regard to local tissue reactions is confernd only 
upon patients ,vho receive maintenance dosing. However, in both Study 15 
and Study 21, .he rates of infusion of th~ loading doses were so low as to 
contribute almost nothing to our understanding of IV loading in an 
emergent setting i.e. status epilepticus where the bioequivalent rate of 
1 00-150 mg/min should be approached. In those situations of rapid 
infusion, local 1njection site reactions might occur with both Dilantin and 
Fe 3, perhaps even with an advantage for Fos. Unfortunately, a head-to­
head comparison of Dilantiri and Fos in comparable rapid infusions has only 
recently begun. Until that study is completed, no definitive statements 
about a Fos advantage over Dil;-ntin for injection site reactions in 
emergent settings can be made. 
3.3 C .>mm on AEs in IV Maintenance Study 
The only study that really speaks to the safety of IV maintenance therapy 
1s Study 15. As alluded to previously, this study in neurosurgic:al patients 
appears to underrepresent (in the face of comparable dose and rate) 
certain AEs which were shown in anot~er study (Study 21) to oc.~ur with 
53 ~. 
hiph frequency in another population (epilepsy). 
If e.11:posure is assumed to be the same after IM maintenance therapy in 
neur . .,surgery patients, Study 14 (uncontrolled) can also be used to support 
IV mllintenance therapy and, alternatively, Study 15 can be used to support 
IM maintenance therapy (albeit without the local IM safety data). 
3.4 "~'Uow" Loading Doses 
For all their differences, there are 4 studies (2 active-control and 2 
uncontrolled) which support subacute loading doses. Studies 14 and 15 
were oerformed in neurosurgery patients and studies 21 and 22 were 
perform~d in epilepsy patients. Studies 15 and 21 had IV loading doses 
while stt~die.s 14 and 22 had IM loading doses. 
3.5 "Rapid" IV Loa<:ling Doses 
Only one study, Study 16, really addresses the safety of IV loading doses 
in status epilepticus. This was an uncontrolled study. 
Some comparative safety data on IV loading is accrued in Studies 15 and 
21 and, although bioequivalent rates were only rarely achieved in those 
studies, do provide some picture of comparative safety. 
In particulc;r, one concern might be that significant AEs might be missed 
in Study 16 if the patients with status epilepticus were too obtunded to 
report them. In Study 21 in epilepsy patients, obtundation is not a 
problem so Iha\ reporting rates for some AEs would be expected to be 
higher, albeit witn the less-than-bioequivalent rates. 
This indication is also the subject of a new active-control trial with 
Oilantin in which bioequivalent rates will be maintained. 
3.6 Rate-related AEs After IV Administration 
As in the normal volunteer studies, paresthesia and pruritus were rate­
related AEs in Fos patiento. At (ates that might be bioequivalent, Dilantin 
patients had a 3-fo\d less incidence of paresthesia and no cases of 
pruritus (compared to a 28% incidence of pruritus in Fos patients). 
54 ~. 
3. 7 Severe A Es 
Across all patient studies, there were 39 severe AEs among 534 Fos 
treated patients (7%). These AEs included ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, 
pain, nausea, ecchymosis, paresthesia, and pruritus. 
3.8 Frequent AEs by Gender 
Paresthesia and nystagmus were more common in men. Headache, 
pruritus, somnolence, and ecchymosis were more common in women. 
However, the sponsor has not adjusted the gender analysis for dose, rate, 
route, or clinical setting. 
3.9 Frequent AEs by Age 
Except for somnolence, the incidence of AEs in Fos patients was no 
different for the 40-65 year old group compared to the > 65 year old group 
(n=67). Somnolence was more common in the > 65 age group. However, the 
sponsor has not adjusted the gender analysis for dose, rate, route, or 
clinical setting. 
3.10 Frequent AEs by Race 
404 patients were white and 110 patients were black. 20 remaining 
patients represented other races. Headache, nausea, and paresthesia 
showed discrepant rates between white and black patients. Paresthesia 
occurred in 6% or 'Nhite patients and only 1 % of black patients. However, 
the sponsor has not adjusted the gender analysis for dose, rate, route, or 
clinical setting. 
3.11 Clinical Labs 
No overall pattern of change in laboratory values emerges for any of the 
parameters reported by the sponsor in the ISS. More detailed reviews of 
patients with extremely high or low values of lab parameters did not raise 
any additional concern. Recall that many patients were only treated with 
a single loading dose of Fos and many patients had concomitant conditions 
that would be expected to cause some lab abnormalities. No pattern of 
change in serum phosphorus was noted. 
55 .. 
3.12 IM Local Tolerablllty 
Of the 357 pati9nts who received at least one IM injection, there were no 
severe injection site reactions. Two moderate injection reactions 
occurred and thirty-one mild reactions occurred. 
3.13 IV Local Tolerability 
Of the 127 patients who received at least one IV injection, there were no 
severe infusion-site reactions. There was one moderate reaction and nine 
mild reactions. 
3.14 Deaths, Serious AEs, and Withdrawals 
Eleven Cerebyx treated patients died. Ten of these deaths occurred in 
neurosurgery studies or status epilepticus studies. A review of these 
deaths raises no new concerns about Cerebyx. None of the deaths can be 
reasonably attributed to Cerebyx. 
A review of the serious AEs and the withdfawals raised no new concerns 
with regard to Cerebyx. The serious AEs that occur with Dilantin may also 
occur with Cerebyx.

June 23, 1995 
As per the adopted convention, all Fos doses and rates are expressed as mg 
phenytoin equivalents in this review. 
The cut-off for the safety database for this submission was Feb 22, 1995. 
Additionally, all deaths and serious adverse events through May 15, 1995 
are reoorted. 
In fact this SU only adds data on 12 additional patients, patients who 
were enrolled in the ongoing study of status epilepticus (SE). Thus a total 
of 66 pts with SE are included in the SU as opposed to 54 in. the NDA. The 
SU presents cumulative data on exposure to Fos, demographics, safety, 
deaths, withdrawals due t·.:> AEs, and serious AEs for the 861 participants 
in trials. Also, AE data tor the 90 participants exposed to Fos at doses of 
at least 1 Omg/kg and rates. of at least 1 OOmg/min were examined.

Deaths and Serious AEs from NOA Cutoff Until Feb 2l, 1995: 
Deaths: One additional death occurred since the filing of the NOA. 
Patient 16 from Study 16, died from an intracranial bleed that was 
present prior to Fos administration. 
Serious AEs: Four additional pis had serious AEs between NOA cutoff 
and Feb 22, 1995. Pt 16 from Study 16 is mentioned above under the 
category "deaths." Pt 20 from Study 16 developed apnea, CHF, and 
pulmonary edema. The pt had been treated for SE in the setting of a 
subdural hematome.; a history of IDDM was obtained. Apnea occurred on 
day 2 and CHF on day 3. Pis 21 and 22 from Study 16 both developed 
postictal psychosis. All 3 pis with nonfatal serious AEs recovered. 
Withdrawals: No pis were withdrawn from Study 16 since the NOA was 
compiled. 
Deaths and Serious AEs from Feb 22, 1995 Until May 15, 1995: 
Deaths: One additional death occurred. Pt 1 from Study 26 (an ongoing 
active control study of IV loading with Fos vs IV loading with Dilantin) 
developed cryptococcal meningitis in the setting of AIDS and died. 
Serious AEs: Pt 2 from Study 26 was hospita1ized for AED toxicity, 
which the investigator considered severe and possibly related to study 
medication. 5 days after treatment in the ER for seizures, the pl was 
admitted with phenytoin toxicity manifested by ataxia with a level of 30; 
he had been taking maintenance phenytoin, 400 mg/day. 
Note: Sponsor's Appendix C.2 (not included) ta:.iula'ies all deaths, serious 
AEs. and withdrawals because of AEs for the ND.ti and through May 15, 95. Demographics: The demographics of the pts with SE do not change with 
the addition of the 12 pts. 
Adverse Events: The AE tables on page 6-7 of the SU (not included) 
encompass all 748 subjects/pts exposed to Fos. Such a table is fairly 
uninformative, given the different routes of administration included. The 
addition of 12 pts to the 736 reported in the NOA did not change the AE 
profile. 
More relevant is the updated list of all AEs (as well as those deemed 
associa!ed with use of drug) from Study 982·16 which occurs as 
Appendix B.1 (not included) of the SU. The 12 additional pts with SE were 
treated under this protocol, with pts receiving IV loading doses of Fos. 
The predominant (>5%) AEs in Studt 16 are nystagmus (29%), headache 
(15%), ataxia (14%), somnolence (12%), agitation (12%), vomiting (11 %), 
pruritus (9%), dizziness (8%), dysarthria (6%), and fever (6%). 
Vital signs: Sponsor's Appendix B.2 from the SU (not included) provides 
the incidence of changes in systolic BP >20 mmHg from Study 16. 37/65 
(57%) pts had such a decrease. The sponsor further divides this group by 
those with a "symptomatic decrease," associated with the AE dizziness, 
vertigo, lightheadedness, or hypotension. 
Infusion site evaluations: Appendix B.3 (not included) from the SU 
provides the incidence of local skin reactions from Study 16. Data are 
grouped for 24-hour posttreatment or discharge. If both 24 hour data and 
discharge Jata are available, it is not clear how the sponsor chose one 
over the other. The way the data are collected, mild tenderness, swelling, 
bruising, and erythema are reported for 3-8% of pts. One pt had moderate 
bruisir>g. 
Clinical lab data: The sponsor states that no clinically significant 
changes were noted for the 12 additional pts in the SU. 
59 Cohort of Patients Adequately Loaded IV: Sponsor's Appendix D.1 
(not included) tabulates patients/subjects treated with Fos at doses 
>10mg/kg and rates > 100mg/min. 105 individual exposures are listed. 
15 normal volunteers had 2 exposures at either different doses or 
different rates; therefore a total of 90 individual subjects are 
included. 
37 of the exposures were in normal volunteers, so that 68 patients were 
treated in this cohort. 51 of these pts came from Study 16, a study of SE. 
17 came from Study 21, a study in pts who simply "required a loading dose 
of phenytoin." The 12 new treated pis in this SU all came from Study 16, 
but only 11/12 are included in this cohort of hi'.Jh dose/high rate pts. 
At this point in time, only 35 individuals have been dosed at 
1 Smg/kg or greater, as well as 150mg/min. 
Sponsor's Tables 5 and 6 summarize the breakdown of AEs by dose and 
rate for the 90 individual subjects exposed. (Note that these Tables were 
reformatted by the sponsor at my request so that pts treated at the higher 
doses and rates are not included in the columns for the lower doses and 
rates as they were in the original tables.) The sponsor concludes that "an 
increased incidence of AEs was not shown for successive increments of 
participants in this subgroup treated with increasing doses and rates. In 
particular, cardiovascular events occurred at a similar incidence across 
groups and did not app<'ar lo be related to the dose or rate of fosphenytoin 
administration." 
However, there are several problems with inferences drawn from Tables 5 
and 6. First, the denominators at any dose or rate window will be low, so 
that we cannot be sure we have captured the true AE profile with any 
certainty. Second, there is no control group. In particular, it would be 
interesting to compare the AE profile between pts randomizt..d to 
phenytoin at 50mg/min vs Fos at 150mg/min. This latter information is 
being collected in the sponsor's ongoing study, Study 26. Finally, recall 
that these pts are often obtunded and cannot report some AEs that an 
awake, alert pt could report. 
Literature Review: The sponsor's literature review covers the time 
period through March 10, 1995. One report of phlebitis in a Fos treate:d pt 
60 is included. The sponsor maintains that, because of the mild tenderness 
alone, a clinical diagnosis of phlebitis was not applicable. This is an 
important issue in that the sponsor has proposed a lower incidence of 
phlebitis with Fos than with parenteral Dilantin. 
Sponsor's Conclusions: The sponsor maintains that the safety profile 
has not changed with the additional information provided in the SU. The 
sponsor maintains that: 
1. Overall, the AE profile of Fos is similar to that of parenteral Dilantin. 
2. IV Fos is associated with fewer infusion site reactions than IV 
Dilantin (i.e. less pain and burning). 
3. IM Fos produced no more injection site reactions than placebo. 
4. High-dose, high-rate Fos IV (i.e. the bioequivalent dose and rate) has no 
more AEs associated with it than lower-dose, lower-rate Fos. 
Reviewer's Conclusions: No sigr.ificant change in the safety profile of 
Fos has arisen with the addition of the 12 new patients. The sponsor's 4 
points above can be addressed as follows: 
1. The AE profiles of Fos and parenteral Dilantin must be compared by 
route of administration. Further, only randomized trials that are 
adequately powered to detect a difference between treatments can truly 
assess the comparability of treatments. 
2. IV Fos at high-dose, high-rate administraticn (the bioequivalent dose 
and rate) has only been given to 35 individual,,. The sponsor's literature 
review demonstrates that IV Fos is not without some risk of local 
irritation; any estimate uf the incidence of infusion site reactions must 
be so imprecise as to preclude any statements in favor of Fos. 
61 3. The statement about IM Fos may be correct based on a study where IM 
maintenance therapy was studied. Whether this holds true for IM loading 
with Fos is unknown. 
4. The !"Opulations of pts that received high-dose, high-rate Fos and 
lower-dose, lower-rate Fos may be so different as to preclude any 
statements about the safety of one regimen vs the other. (I suspect that 
pts with SE were more likely to receive the more aggressive regimens. 
These pts might be sicker on average and thus less likely to report events 
such as dizzin ~ss or tinnitus.) Only a randomized study can answer this 
question. 
Looking at IV loading doses alone, Fos, at the bioequivalent dose and 
rate, has the potential to cause local reactions and has been shown to 
cause hypotension (as defined by > 20mmHg drop in SBP) in 57% of pis. 
The advantages of IV Fos are: 1) It can be given in 1/J the time required 
to give an equimolar dose of Dilantin; and 2) It is more compatible with 
other IV fluids and drugs than Dilantin. 
IV maintenance Fos has the same two advantages over Dilantin. 
IM loading with Fos is tolerated, while Dilantin is reported to cause 
local irritation and unpredictable systemic absorption. The SU has not 
changed the database to either support or refute the use of IM loading with 
Fos. 
IM maintenance with Fos presents the same situation as IM loading. 
Again the SU has not changed the position of Fos in this regard.

Second Safety Update 
October 31, 1995 
November 4, 1995 
As per the adopted convention, all Fos doses and rates are expressed as mg 
phenytoin equivalents (PE) in this review. 
The cut-off for the safety database for this submission was Aug 1, 1995. 
Additionally, all deaths and serious adverse events through Sept 15, 1995 
are reported. 
In fact this SU adds data on 111 additional patients since the first safety 
update. The sponsor reports that the safety profile of Cerebyx in the 
safety update is consistent with that reported in the NOA and first safety 
update. 
Since the first safety update, 3 deaths, 4 serious AEs, and 8 withdrawals 
due to AEs have occurred in 8 Cerebyx treated patients. The 3 deaths were 
due to cerebral edema, accidental drowning, and GI bleeding. Reasons for 
withdrawal included generalized itching, burning and itching, nausea and 
itching, hypotension, and agitation. 
All I 11 new exposures to Cerebyx were to the IV formulation. No new IM 
data is provided. 
Data from 2 studies initiated and completed since the submission of the 
NOA and first safety update are included, Study 27 and Study 26. TABLE I. Number of Participants and Time Periods Covered in Safety

• Some subjects received multiple exposures to fosphenytoin but are only counted \JUCe in this table. 
b All additional exposures were from an ongoing study of patients wilb status epilepticus (982-16). 
69 Study 27 
The final study report for Study 27 is not provided. 
This was an open-label single dose study in which 16 normal volunteers 
re:eived 1200mg Fos at 150mg/min. There were no deaths, no serious 
AEs, or withdrawals due to AEs. No slowing or discontinuation of 
infusions because of AEs is specifically reported. 
226 AEs were reported. 108 were mild. 106 were moderate. 12 were 
severe in intensity. The severe AEs included: 
pruritus 4 events 
paresthesia 2 events 
dizziness 2 events 
aching knees 1 event 
pelvic pain (burning) 1 event 
asthenia 1 event 
tinnitus 1 event 
"The duration of the event . . . was <30 minutes for 7 subjects, <2 hours for 
2 subjects, <5 hours for 1 subject, and <21 hours for 2 subjects." 
Injection-site symptoms including inflammation and reaction were 
experienced by 3 subjects and were all rated mild in intensity. 
75% of subjects experiencea paresthesia. 75% of subjects experienced 
pruritus. 
The snonsor oeports no changes in ECGs or clinical labs of clinical 
siq~11ficance. One subject experienced a drop in BP to 67/43 1 O minutes 
after infusion. 
In reviewing the clinical lab dala listings, I note that 9 subjects had 
ionized free calcium levels checked at variable times after infusion. All 
of the values reported are unremarkable. 5 of the 9 had free calcium 
levels checked immediately after the infusion. The sponsor makes no 
comment about these specific levels and their significance. 
In reviewing the clinical lab data listings, 
checked at frequent intervals after dosing. 
70 also noted bicarb levels were 
It appears that baseline levels dip by a small increment for some patients, while patient 16 had a level 
below the stated normal range. Agdin the sponsor does not comment on 
these levels. 
Stud)' 26 
This wa~1 a 112 patient, doub!e-blind, randomized, parallel study of an IV 
loading dose of fosphenytoin vs. an IV loading dose of phenytoin. P.1tients 
were random!zed in a 4:1 ratio to fos vs phenytoin. The 
inclusion/exclt:sion criteria did not specify particular diagnostic 
categories of p;~tients to be included; rather pis who required a loading 
dose of phenytoin were to be included. Broadly speaking, this would 
include pts who were in status epilepticus as well as many other patients. 
Pts received equimolar amounts of fos or phenytoin. The bioequivalent 
infusion rates (based on free phenytoin levels) were used so that the time 
of infusion was approximately 7 minutes for fos and 20 minutes for 
phenytoin. The total dose was to be 20mg/kg phenytoin equivalents (PE) 
except for patients with baseline phenytoin levels or patients over 65 
years of age who received 15mg/kg. 
90 patients received Cerebyx while 22 received Dilantin. The study was 
started in April, 1995 and completed in June, 1995. 
Roughly half the patients in each treatment group were epilepsy patients; 
roughly a third of the patients in each treatment group were neurosurgery 
patients. Only 2 patients witll status epilepticus were entered and both 
were in the Cerebyx arm of the trial. 
14% of Cerebyx patients had the infusion modified because of AEs; 2% had 
the infusion modified because of AEs and pump problems. 50% of Dilantin 
patients had the infusion modified because of AEs; 14% had the infusion 
modified because of AEs and pump problems. The predominant reason for 
modifying the infusion in Dilantin patients was the occurre11ce of local 
in1ection site pain. The predominant reason for modifying the infusion in 
Cerebyx patients was the occurrence of more generalized itching and 
tingling, espec;ally in the groin and lower extremities.

74 The AE profile in this study reveals pruritus in 50% of Cerebyx patients 
and 5% of Dilantin patients. 
Of the 44 Cerebyx patients who reported pruritus, 6 reported severe 
intensity. 8 patients had pruritus continue for up to 1·2 hours. Not stated 
is the intensity of the pruritus for these last 8 patients. 5 patients had 
no stop time recorded for the pruritus. 4 were listed as recovered at the 
follow-up visit. One was listed as clinical outcome unknown. 
The infusion was modified for 13/44 Cerebyx patients with pruritus. 
of the patients with pruritus reported any additional skin reactions, 
or other AEs suggesfo1e of drug hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.

Cohort of Patients Adequately Loaded IV: All the new exposures in 
this safety update were IV, primarily at high doses and rates as a result 
of the Study 26 '.md Study 27 protocols. Therefore, there are currently 
194 individuals in the safety database (38 volunteers and 156 patients) 
who received Cerebyx at doses >10mg/kg and rates > 100mg/min. Of these 
194 individuals, 128 received Cerebyx at > 15mg/kg and > 150mg/min. 66 
received Cerebyx at ~ 19 .5mg/kg and ?:. 150 mg/min. 
Spom:;or's Table 11 summarizes the breakdown of AEs by dC1se and rate for 
the 128 patients exposed. 
Sponsor's Table 12 summarizes the breakdown of AEs according to the 
reported intensity of the AEs. 
Given the heterogenicity of the total population treated at the highest 
dose and rate (status epilepticus, neurosurgery, epilepsy), care must be 
exercised in extrapolating from these results.

~ Sponsor's Discuspion: In this second satety update, the sponsor 
acknowledges the occurrence of pruritus in Cerebyx-treated subjects and 
patients. The sponsor comments that other phosphate ester prodrugs, 
Decadron and Hydrocortone, cause a burning sensation in the groin area. 
The sponsor states that Foscavir in the treatment of CMV retinitis causes 
tingling. The sponsor draws attention to the fact that, in Study 26, 
infusions were interrupted more often with Dilantin than with Cerebyx. 
The sponsor acknowledges that interruptions require patients to be awake; 
the sponsor states that patients were, as a rule, awake in Study 26, 
although specific treatment group comparisons of level of consciousness 
are not presented. 
My Comments: After reviewing the sponsor's references on Decadron and 
Hydrocortone, I am impressed by the similarities between the character 
and the location of the sensory disturbance that those drugs create and 
th<,t Cerebyx creates. Specifically, Cerebyx, like Decadron and 
Hydrocortone, seems to cause a burning and itching which predominates in 
the groin area. The intensit~' of the disturban~e seems less with Decadron 
and Hydrocortone, but the loading dose of these drugs would delivtir 0·1ly 
1 /20th-1/10th the phosphate that a loading dose of Cerebyx would 
deliver. Could phosphate alone cause this characteristic sensory 
disturbance ? If so, are there any intermediate steps required, for 
instance, the induction ot hypocalcemia via caldum-pl:osphate 
precipitation ? 
My answer to the last q..icstion would be, perhaps not. The sensory 
disturbance described in hypocalcemia is usually a tingling that localizes 
to the face and hands. While tingling is also described in Cerebyx-treated 
patients, burning and it:hing predominate in the d~scriptions provided. 
Further, the burning and itching with Cerebyx is oft~n immediate in onset, 
suggesting a minimal number of steps to cause the phenomenon. Also, free 
calcium levels were checked in 5 subjects in Study 27 immediately after 
infusion and were normal. (Not stated was whether these same 5 subjects 
had sensory disturbances.) 
The sponsor mentions Foscavir as another drug that causes sensory 
disturbances. My understanding is that Foscavir is not broken down to 
80 phosphate, but rather is excreted unchanged in the urine. It is believed 
that Foscavir actually chelates calcium causing a transient hypocalcemia 
which, in turn, causes the characteristic sensory disturbance of 
hypocalcemia (tingling in the face and hands). Therefore, I do not think 
Foscavir-induced sensory phenomena are parallel to Cerebyx-induced 
sensory phenomena. 
From Studies 26 and 27, I believe the sponsor could provide a much better 
description of the sensory disturbance caused by the SE dosing regimen of 
Cerebyx. Currently, I have only been provided narrative accounts for 
patients and subjects who had "serious" AEs. Patients who had "severe" 
but· not "serious" sensory disturbances are of special interest. For these 
patients. I think we need to know the duration of sensory disturbance.

A. Study Design 
This was a 5-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
of IM Fos. By protocol, adult pts were considered for inclusion if they 
were taking oral Dilantin tor the treatment of epilepsy or seizure 
prophylaxis, had stable blood phenytoin 13Vels, and were maintaining a 
record of their seizures. 
Pts in one grouµ (25% of total N) were to continue receiving their oral 
Dilantin dose along with IM placebo. Pts in the other group (75% of the 
total N) were to receive placebo orally along with IM Fas. 
Sponsor's Table 3, a schedule of time and events, is attached. After each 
injection, subjective evaluations of any irritation produced by the 
injections were to be made by the patient and the investigator. Seizures 
were to be recorded. One week after the last injection, a final physical 
exam was to be performed. 
85 A subset of pts at a single study site (N=24) was to have a mora extensive 
PK evaluation. The rest of tf)e pts had determinations madf' of plasma 
phenytoin levels immediately before double-blind treatment and again rm 
the fifth day of treatment. The subset of 24 pts had io be on a QD regimen 
and had plasma samples collected on Day -1 before dosing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post dosing. On Days 1-4, samples ware collected 
before dosing. On Day 5, scamples were collected before dosing anci 0.5, 1, 
1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post dosing. Samples were 
an>lyzed for total and free phenytoin levels and Fos levels. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria were as follows: 
o Pts with epilepsy or recovering from neurosurgery 
o 18 years of age and older 
o On a stable dose of oral Dilantin for treatment or prophylaxis 
o Oral regimen QD or BID 
o Phenytoin levels between 10-20, with 2 samples between 1-4 
weeks apart within 4 weeks of study entry which are within 30% of one 
another 
0 
treated 
0 
0 Have a written record of seizures for at least 28 days (if being

Not on more than 2 drugs to control seizures 
Ansence of life-threatening disease 
Injections were given in the gluteus maximus and could be divided into 2 
equal injections given in separate locations if the dose required a large 
volume. The pt was to rate on a 4 point scale the extent of pain, itching, 
and burning immediately after injection and again at 5, 30, 60, and 120 
min post-injection, and immediately prior to the next injection. 
The attending investigator would examine the site of injection at 5 and 30 
min, and 1 and 2 hr after injection and again immediately prior to the next 
injection. A subjective rating of injury and local irritation was to be 
made using a 4 point scale applied to the 4 zymptoms: redness, swelling, 
tenderness, and necrosis. 
The dose of oral and IM study medication could be adjusted to maintain 
therapeutic blood concentrations and to minimize phenytoin toxicity. 
The protocol-specified analysis plan was vague beyond stating that iocai 
86 irritation would be compared between groups. It was stated that analyses 
of both safety and efficacy would be stratified based on whether the drug 
was given as prophylaxis or as treatment for epilepsy. 
The efficacy analysis was likewise vague other than to say that 
comparisons between treatment groups would be made for seizure control, 
looking at the treatment period as well as the immediate pre-and post­
treatment periods. 
"The sample size of 200 was not chosen based on statistical 
considerations. This number of pts, added to those in other studies, is 
intended to demonstrate safe pas::;age of pis treated with Fos in a sample 
of over 500 pts and normal volunteers." 
8. Subject Disposition and l,aseline Comrarison 
The first pt entered the study on April 23, 1991 and the last pt completed 
the study on December 30, 1991. 240 pt~ were randomized; 5 pts in the 
Fos group did not receive all 5 days of dosing and 1 additional pt who did 
receive 5 days of dosing did not return for the follow-up visit. 
By desi£:n, pts could receive medication QD or BID; in fact, all pis received 
their medication QD. One treatment group consisted of 179 pts. The other 
treatment group consisted of 61 pts. The two treatment groups were 
similar in demographic characteristics. 95% of pis in both groups carried 
a diagnosis of epilepsy; only 6 pts in one group and 3 pts in the other were 
neuros1Jrgery pts who required seizure prophylaxis. The mean daily dose 
of Dilantin was 375mg, with a range of 200-500mg. 
The two treatment groups were balanced with respect to the concurrent 
.4.ED medications used. 70% of pis took no other AEDs. 9-10% of pis took 
concurrent phenobarb. 9-10% of pts took concurrent VPA. 7-8% of pis 
lor1K concurrent carbamazepine. 
174/179 pts in the Fos group received all 5 days of treatment. 61/61 pts 
in the Dilantin g:oup received all 5 days of treatment. 
During the treatment phase, 13 Fos pts had their dose adjusted. 5/13 had 
doses lowered because of AEs such as confusion, ataxia, dizziness, and 
87 -
nystagmus. 2/13 had doses raised because of poor seizure control. 5/13 
had dose adjustments because plasma levels were either too high (2) or 
too low (3); recall that the protocol called for levels during the treatment 
phase only in pts in the PK special study group. 1 /13 had the dose lowered 
simply due to noncompliance. 
2 pts withdrew because of AEs. 2 pts withdrew because of 
"administrative" reasons. A fifth pt in the Fos group did not receive all 5 
doses, but completed the study visits. 
Protocol variations that could impact on interpretation of local irritation 
were as follows: 
nonalternating sides for medication injection in 75 pts 
multiple injection sites in 7 pts 
multiple injections for a given dose not of equal volume in 5 pts 
In 26 pts, at least one phenytoin level during screen was less than 10. In 
3 pis, the 2 plasma levels during screen were not within 30% of each 
other. 
C. Results 
Given the multiple tests for local irritation performed by both the pts and 
physicians, along with the multiple time points at which these tests were 
performed for each injection, and the 5 different injections, it is hard to 
envision a statistic that would capture all this data in a meaningful way. 
Suffice it to say that a visual screen of all the listings for local skin 
irritation reveal no clinically significant differences between ros and 
placebo injections, other than a slight increase in mild to moderate 
itching within the first hour after injection. 
No deaths occurred during the study. 2 pts withdrew from the Fos group 
because of AEs. 1 pt experienced a serious AE in the Fos group. The one 
serious AE reported was phenytoin toxicity. The pt recovered completely 
after withdrawal from \he study; the investigator noted that the pt had 
taken some additional doses of Dilantin from her own supply on Days 1 and 
2 of treatment. The other withdrawal was due to an allergic reaction and 
pruritus, witr full recovery off treatment. (Recall that pts had been 
exposed to phenytoin chronically beiore entering the study; exposure to Fos was not the pt's first exposure to phenytoin.) 
The percent of pts reporting any AEs was slightly higher in the Fos group 
(68°/o) compared to the placebo group (62%). 
There was a higher incidence of nystagmus, incoordination, headache, 
nausea, and pruritus in the Fos group. 
During the study, 6 pts experienced AEs that were rated "severe" hi 
intensity, 4 on Fos and 2 on placebo. In the Fos group, one pt was 
discussed above as the withdrawal for allergic reaction and pruritus. 
There was one case each of severe nausea, vomiting, &nd migraine. In the 
placebo group, there was one case of dizziness that responded to a reduced 
dose, and one case of local excision of a breast lesion. 
The incidence of seizures during treatment differed between the Fas and 
placebo groups (18% vs 10%). In particular, Fas pts had a high incidence 
of partial complex seizures (11 %) compared to placebo (2%). Two Fos pts 
required dose adjustments because of poor seizure control. Most pts 
experienced no seizures in either treatment gro•;p so that the sponsor's 
comparison of average number of seizl.lres per day between treatment 
groups is not very instructive. The sponsor acknowledges that the latter 
is highly influenced by a single patient with a large number of seizures. 
The sponsor reports some additional analyses which compare change from 
baseline to treatment period or change from treatment period to post­
treatment; no statistically significant differences were found. 
Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate were recorded in relation 
to Fos injections. No clinically important trends were noted in any of 
these parameters following Fos injection, although 2-3 pts were noted to 
have blood pressures as low as 90/60 3'J-60 minutes after Fos injection. 
Pt 11-13 who discontinued because of dizziness had a BP of 90/60 30 
minutes post-dose with a pre-dose pressure of 110/70. No pressures 
lower than 90/60 were noted for any pt at any time. 
To determine any trend towaru abnormal lab values during the study, pts 
were categorized as to whether their lab values were below, within, or 
above normal range at baseline and at the end of treatment. Changes to 
low or high from the screening value to the first f0llow-up visit were 
summarized. The sponsor notes that no consistent differences or clinically important trends were evident. Changes from normal at screen 
to low at flu occurred for at least 10% of pts in either group for ABC 
count, WBC count, and calcium. 
Detailed PK Analysis: At Center 3, evaluable data was available for 13 pts 
out of a targeted population of 24. The sponsor explains that for 7 of the 
remaining 11 pts, samples were collected in heparinized tubes which were 
later found to interfere with Fos measurements. The remaining 4 pis 
were in the oral Dilantin/IM placebo group and were therefore not included 
in the analyses. For the 13 available, samples had been drawn at baseline 
at numerous times in relation to oral dose administration; on day 5, 
samples again were drawn at numerous times in relation to IM Fos 
administration. The ratios for Day 5 (IM Fos)/Baseline (oral Dilantin) are 
as follows: 
Total Phenytoin 
Gm ax 1.21 
Tm ax 0.66 
AUG 1.05 
Free Phenytoin 
Gmax 1.32 
Tm ax 0.42 
AUG 1.18 
The increases in Cmax and AUG might be explained by the increased 
bioavailability of Fos (100%) relative to oral Dilantin (90%). The more 
marked increases in free phenytoin following IM Fos might be consistent 
with displacement of phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites by Fos. 
Overall PK Analysis at All Centers: A trend analysis was used to 
de.ermine if there were differences in trough concentrations between 
treatment groups over time. 20 pis who required changes in dosage during 
the study were excluded from the analysis; data were available for 165 
Fos treated pis and 55 Dilantin treated pts. The results showed that the 
mean trough concentrations of total phenytoin provided by Fos increased 
slightly from the first day through the follow-up visit, while the mean 
trough levels provided by Dilantin orally tended to stay the same. The 
increase in trough levels seen with Fos may be consistent with the 
complete bioavailability of IM Fos. 
90 D. Conclusions 
The PK data from this trial needs further Biopharm review. Based on the 
sponsor's presentation of the data, it appears that an IM dose of Fos may 
be substituted for an equimolar oral dose of Dilantin, achieving plasma 
levels of total phenytoin and free phenytoin which are roughly 20% higher. 
The AE profile of IM Fos reflects an increased incidence of nystagmus, 
incoordination, nausea, and headache, all of which might be expected with 
higher phenytoin and free phenytoin levels. The increased incidence of 
pruritus with IM Fos is unexpected based on higher phenytoin levels alone, 
but would not preclude use of IM Fos. 
Perhaps the pts who would benefit most by IM Fos would be chronically 
Dilantin-treated pis who have a transient 2-3 day gastrointestinal 
disturbance which prevents oral medication, but is transient and not 
expected to require IV access for hydration or caloric intake. 
Because of the delayed Tmax of total phenytoin and free phenytoin after IM 
Fos, IM Fos is not an alternative route of phenytoin administration in pis 
with status epilepticus.

A. Study Design 
The study was intended to be a safety study. The projected enrollment 
was 150 patients. 
Patients were to be candidates for neurosurgery or patients w'io had 
already undergone neurosurgery. Open-label treatment was to consist of a 
single loading dose followed by maintenance dosing for at least 3 days and 
for a maximum of 7 days (changed by amendment to 14 days). Patients 
were to return 2-4 davs after the last injection for follow-up exams and 
procedures. A subset of patients at a single site (n=10) were to have PK 
determinations performed at various timepoints following injections. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria dictated that patients be 12 years of age or 
older. Pis were not to be have terminal illnesses or other life­
threatening diseases. 
To be ex.eluded were pts with hypotension, bradycardia, and A-V block. 
Pis were excluded if they took any AED except benzodiazepines within 1 
week prior to screen. 
No medications were specifically excluded during the study. Any IV 
medications other than the study medication were to be administered at a 
96 site different from that used for study drug. 
By protocol the study drug could be administerad either QD or BID as 
deemed appropriate by the investigator to achieve therapeutic 
concentrations of at least 10-20 microgms/ml. A protocol amendment 
required QD dosing only. Page 7 of the protocol implies that the loading 
dose would be 8-12 mg/kg PE. 
The dosing administration could be divided and given in separate locations 
on the buttock. 
During the treatment period, a trough blood phenytoin was to be drawn 
each day, prior to the patient receiving the first daily dose of study 
medication. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
The study was conducted between July 1991 and April 1992. 
The study population included 78 males and 40 females, 93 whites and 25 
blacks. The mean age was 48 years. 
The pis were seriously ill neurosurgery pis who were victims of trauma 
to the head or other neurological emergencies, the most common of which 
were motor vehh~le accidents and gunshot wounds. Over 1/5 pts were 
unconscious whe:i they entered the study, and over 1/2 pis had a level of 
consciousness th~1t was leth<irgic or worse. 
110 pis completed treatment. 80 pis completed the follow-up 
assessments. 8 pis withdrew, 6 for admin reasons and 2 for AEs. 
118 patients were given a loading dose between 8·21.6 mg/kg PE. 
Maintenance doses ranged from 1.7-17.2 mg/kg. Maintenance doses were 
given either QD or BID. 64 pts received QD doses, 45 pis received BID 
doses, and 9 pis received both QD and BID doses. 
While the maximum treatment duration was extended by protocol 
amendment from 7 days to 14 clays, only 5 pis received treatment for 8 
days or greater. 
97 C. Results 
Eight pts withdrew from the study, 2 for administrative reasons ar.d 6 
because of AEs. Only 1/6 experienced an event that was considered drug 
related, an erythematous rash. At the follow-up visit, most of the rash 
had resolved. 
Four pis who withdrew from the study died. Three other pts died after 
completing the study. 
At any one llmepoint, a maximum of 3 pts experienced mild irritation at 
the injection site. 
Note that the AE data was grouped across the entire study and was not 
separated according to loading vs maintenance, dosing. Altogether, 75% of 
pts reported AEs; only 8% of pts overall had AEs that were considered 
associated with study drug. The most frequent AEs were fever, 
somnolence, and nystagmus. 5% of pis experienced at least one seizure 
during open-label treatment; without a comparative treatment group, it is 
hard to interpret this finding. 
Ten pts experienced serious AEs, but none of these were considered 
associated with study drug. 
Changes from baseline in laboratory parameters occurred not infrequently 
during this study. However, given the population of seriously ill trauma 
patients requiring neurosurgery, rio inferences can be made from the lab 
data. 
For each patient studied, the mean trough phenytoin concentration for the 
study duration was > 10. Recall that daiiy trough concentrations were 
measured and doses adjusted to keep the daily levels > 10. 
D. Conclusions 
In a seriously ill neurosurgical population, the sponsor has demonstrated 
that plasma levels of phenytoin > 10 can be achieved and maintained. No 
safety concerns obviously related to Fos arose during the conduct of the 
study, but the natural tendency in this population is to attribute all AEs to the underlying condition or the treatment of the underlying condition. Mild 
to moderate AEs will be overshadowed by more serious AEs in this 
populatiJn. 
No efficacy data arises from this study. The occurrence of seizures in 
s.Jme patients despite plasma levels of phenytoin > 10 was documented, 
but is not surprising given the severity of the underlying conditions. Study 982-15: A Study of the Tolerance and Safety of IV

A. Study Design 
This was a double-blind, parallel-group, active control trial in patients 
requiring a loading dose of phenytoin to prevent or control seizures. Pis 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1 :3 ratio 
to receive either parenteral Dilantin or Fosphenytoin. 
The objectives of tile study were 1) to evaluate the safety and tolerance 
of multiple IV doses of Fos for seizure prophylaxis in neurosurgery 
patients and 2) to obtain descriptive PK data for Fos in this patient 
population. 
The study had 3 phases: 
1 . Screening phase 
2. Treatment phase, Days 1-14 
3. Follow-up phase for 2-4 days following the last IV dose 
The treatment pti.,se included a loading dose on Day 1 followed by daily IV 
maintenance infusions. "Al the prestudy investigators meeting, the 
100 minimum exposure requirement was defined as 72 hours, i.e. a loading 
dose followed by 2 days of maintenance dosing." 
Pts at Center 5 had serial blood samples drawn over a 24 hour period 
beginning on the day of loading dose to determine total and free phenytoin 
concentrations in plasma. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 12 years of age or older. 
Patients were tc. require neurosurgery or were to have undergone 
neurosurgery. Pts were to be scheduled for neurosurgery within 14 days 
of entry into double-blind treatment. 
To be excluded were pis with hypotension, bradycardia, and A-V block. 
Pts were excluded if they took any AED except benzodiazepines within 1 
week prior to screen. 
No medications were specifically excluded during the study. Any IV 
medications other than the study medication were to be administered at a 
site different from that used tor study drug by using a second IV line. 
By protocol, study drug could not be administered at rates greater than 50 
mg/min either for loading or maintenance. The study drug could be 
administered either QD or BID as deemed appropriate by the investigator. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
The study was conducted between July 1992 and February 1993. 
In general, patients were seriously ill neurosurgery patients who were 
suffering from head trauma or other neurological emergencies. With rare 
exceptions, patients underwent neurosurgical procedures on Study Day 1. 
88 pis received IV Fos while 28 pts received IV Dilantin. The loading dose 
of Fos was given as a total dose between 7.3-22.4 mg/kg PE at infusion 
rates between 14-51 mg/min PE. Oilantin was given as a total dose 
between 7.8-19.8 mg/kg at infusion rates between 21-51 mg/min. 
Maintenance doses of Fos were given as total doses of 1.2-23 mg/kg PE at 
infusion rates between 3.1-62.1 mg/min PE. Maintenanc·J Dilantin was 
given as total doses of 1 .3-18.4 mg/kg at infusion rates between 5.1-50 mg/min. 
No patients receh1ed concurrent antiepileptic drugs during the screening 
phase of the study. Thus, patients should not have had baseline levels of 
phenytoin or any other AED. During the treatment phase, 4 pt::; received 
phenytoin in an unblinded fashion (3 Fos, 1 Dilantin), 3 pts received 
diazepam, and 2 pts received lorazepam. 
Concurrent meds, other than AEDs, were in large part dictated by the 
individual's neurosurgery status. 108 pis actually had surgery during the 
study. 27/108 had surgery before beginning treatment with studt drug. 
791108 had neurosurgery rJuring the study. 2/108 had surgery after 
completing the study. Thus, 44% of pis were taking CNS agents at screen 
and this increased to 96% during double-blind treatment. The most 
common CNS agents were acetaminophen, fentanyl, codeine, and morphine. 
To further complicate all this, we are told that small numbers of pts 
received BID maintenance dosing instead of QD, while similarly small 
numbers of pis received maintenance dosing as OD medication some days 
::ind BID medication other days. 
14 pt:; withdrew from the study, 4 because of AEs and 10 for 
administrative reasons. Only 4 pts in each treatment group were treated 
for more than 7 days. 
C. Results 
Because the loading dose of Fos was not given at the bioequivalent rate of 
administration, this study cannot provide comparable safety data between 
an IV loading dose of Fos and an IV loading dose of Dilantin. 
Comparable safety data between IV maintenance regimens of IV Fos and IV 
Dil,intin is provided. One death occurred in each treatment group, 
unrelated to the treatment itself. One serious AE occurred in the Fos 
group and 2 serious AEs occurred in the Dilantin group; none were deemed 
related to tr.e underlyi11g treatment. Among AEs deemed associated with 
treatment, there was only 1 severe AE and this occurred in the Fos group: 
severe ataxia. 
Amo11g a listing of all AEs, the obvious discrepancies between treatment groups occur for injection site reaction, injection site pain, and pruritus. 
The trend is for more local reactions with Dilantin and more generalized 
pruritus with Fos. 
Seizures were so rare in both treatment groups that no meaningful 
statement about the anticonvulsant properties of either treatment can be 
made. 
The sponsor (p 49 of the study report) presents changes in vital sign data 
between screening and 2 hours post loading dose for the 2 treatment 
groups. There are no obvious differences between treatment gro1~ps. 
Changes seen in laboratory parameters during the study were felt to be 
most consistent with the population being studied, i.e. ill neurosurgery 
patients. 
PK data was also accrued which demonstrates roughly equivalent trough 
levels of phenytoin with both the IV Fos and IV Dilantin regimens. During 
treatment, dose was adjusted by the investigators based on plasma 
phenytoin monitoring. The extrapolation of this might be that IV Fos can 
be used to achieve and maintain therapeutic plasma phenytoin 
concentrations while monitoring trough plasma phenytoin levels. 
On page 65 of the study report, the sponsor summarizes changes in rates 
of infusion. Presumably, these changes pertain primarily to the loading 
doses administered. 17% of Fos pis and 36% of Dilantin pts required 
decreases in rates. Note, however, that the bioequivalent rate of Fos 
administration for IV loading was not given. Thus, a comparis0n of 
proportions of pis requiring dose reductions under the conditions of 
bioequivalence might have resulted in very different results. 
The same problem in comparing groups arises when comparing groups for 
dose reductions due to injection site burning and itching. 5% of Fos pis 
required this while 18% of Dilantin pts required this. RR-REG 720-03441 SS -·e .. _, .~ ~

A. Study Design 
This was an open-label, single dose study in status epilepticus. 
The objectives of the study were to 1) establish the safety of two rates 
of IV Fos in pts with status and 2) obtain descriptive PK data. 
By protocol, the firs! 10 patients would receive Fos up to a maximum rate 
of 100 mg PE/min. If that W'.IS well tolerated, sut::sequent patients would 
receive rates up to a maximum of 150 mg/min. On Feb 10, 1993, data 
from 14 patients who received Fos at 100 mg/min PE were reviewed by 
Parke·Davis in consultation with a panel of noncompany neurologists. The 
panel unanimously recommended that the rate of Fos administration could 
be increased to 150 mg/min PE as provided in the protocol. 
Status was defined as 2 or more consecutive seizures without regaining 
consciousness or a single seizure of at least 10 minutes duration; 
patients with partial status or absence status were excluded. Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 5 years of age or older. 
There were no restrictions on AED use prior to study entry. Likewise, 
there were no restrictions on concurrent medication to treat the episode 
of status. 
The protocol required that "if two IV lines are available, study medication 
should be administered through one line and all other medications through 
the other. If only one line is available, it is important to clear the IV line 
with normal saline between the administration of other medications and 
study drug." 
During administration, vital signs were to be recorded every 5 minutes. 
Continuous ECG recording was to be performed during infusion. If systolic 
blood pressure dropped by 20 mmHg, the investigator could slow the 
infusion rate. If the absolute SBP dropped below 70, the investigator was 
to stop the infusion; or.ce the BP returned to an acceptable level, the 
infusion could be restarted at 50% the original rate. 
The goal of the study was to enroll between 20-100 pis between July and 
December 1992. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
54 patients were enrolled at 10 centers by September 1, 1994. There 
were 32 males and 22 females, 23 whites and 23 blacks. The mean age 
was 39 years of age with a range of 15 years to 75 years. 
26% of patients had status precipitated by AED withdrawal or 
noncompliance (i.e. had the potential to have low, but measurable levels of 
phenytoin alre"dy present prior to IV loading). The sponsor notes that 
only 43 pis had usable p:asma drug-concentration data; of these, 16 had 
measurable phenytoin concentrations prior to Fos infusion. The mean level 
for these pts was 6 with a range from 0.12 up to 15. 
Six pts (11%) had partial status or absence status in violation of the 
protocol. The other patients all had generalized status, either primary 
generalized or secondariiy generalized. 
In 42/54 (78%) of pts, bP.nzodiazepmes were given prior tc, administration 
of Fos. 35 patients received loading doses at rates of 100 mg/min. (Recall that 
150 mg/min is the rate considered bioequivalent to standard Dilantin 
loading doses). 18 pis received loading doses at rates > 150 mg/min. 
All but 4 pis received total loading doses of 10 mg/kg or greater. 
C. Results 
Unfortunately, safety data is presented for the entire group of 
54 patients; it would be helpful to see a review of adverse 
events only for the 12 patients who were dosed as per the 
proposed labeling. On page 36 of the study report, the sponsor presents 
a brief review entitled "Adverse Events by Rate of Administration." Here 
the sponsor states Iha.I the 5 most frequent AEs appeare1 to occur at 
similar frequencies for pis at faster rates (41%) compared with slower 
rates (45%). In this section, the sponsor does not address the fact that 
the post r.oc separation of pts into high rate/low rate groups does not 
control for baseline levels of AEDs, especially phenytoin. 
No patients withdrew for AEs. 3 patients died after completing the study 
but all were considered unrelated to Fos. The 8 most frequent adverse 
event~ were nystagmus, ataxia, headache, agitation, dysarthria, 
somnolence, vomiting, and pruritus. 
Of note in safety data accrued after the cutoff date for this report is the 
occurrence of two cases of postictal psychosis, both beginning 3 days 
after status was treated with Fos. One patient had a previous, less severe 
case of psychosis after status; the other patient had not experienced 
previous post-ictal psychosis. A sensation of itchiness followed the 
~sychosis in one patients. 
60% of patients had a > 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure; only 4% 
had a symptomatic drop in SBP. The sponsor states that, "While the 
magnitude of decreases in blood pressure were substantial in some 
patients, no changes in infusion rate or interventions (eg, Trendelenburg 
positioning, IV fluids. or medications) were required to treat any 
hypotensive symptoms." Status continued beyond 30 minutes post infusion of Fos in only 3 
patients. 2 of these had other explanations besides lack of efficacy i.e. 
subdural and anoxic brain insult post CPR. Patient 8, Center 9 had a 
gradual decline in seizures over 45 minutes. The Infusion rat'! 
for this patient was 90 mg/min PE; no plasma levels are 
available for this patient during the first 20 minutes of 
treatment raising the question whether a faster Infusion rate 
would have been more effective. Study 982-21: A Single-Dose Study of the Tolerance and Safety

A. Study Design 
This was a doi..l:lle-blind, parallel-group, active control trial in patients 
requiring a l'Jading dose of phenytoin to prevent or control seizures. Pis 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1 :3 ratio 
to receive either parenteral Dilantin or Fosphenytoin. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria required that pts be 12 years of age or older 
anci require a loading dose of phenytoin. Pts whose condition was serious 
or life-threatening were not considered appropriate candidates for the 
study. In particular, patients in status epilepticus were excluded. 
l'Jeurosurgery patients who required acute treatment were also excluded. 
The inclusion criteria required that patients be able to ~valuate the extent 
of pain, burning and itch:ng experienced as a result of the infusion. 
The anticipated enrollmer.t was 60 patients, 20 from each of 3 centers. 
During the infusion, vital signs were to be recorded every 5 minutes and 
ECG was to be monitored continuously. After the infusion, vital signs 
were to be recorded every 15 minutee for 2 hours. 
The rate ot infusion was not to exceed 50 mg/min PE. By protocol, the 
investigat'Jr was to consider slowing the rate it SBP dropped by 20 mmHg 
or greater. If SBP dropped to an absolute of 70mmHg, the infusion was to 
be stopped; once SBP was acceptable, the infusion could be restarted at 
half the previous rate. By protocol amendment, the maximum rate was increased to 1 OOmg/min 
PE tor Fos patients. 
B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
39 pts received IV Fos while 13 pts received IV Dilantin. 
The majority of pts required a loading dose because of new onset seizures 
or because their baseline phenytoin levels had dropped below the 
therapeutic range que to noncompliance or prescribed dosage change. 
Fos was given as a total dose betw9en 480-1500 mg/kg PE at infusion 
rates between 40-103 mg/min PE. Dilantin was given as a total dose 
between 290-1000 mg/kg at infusion rates between 20-51 m~/min. 
Because of the design of the study, a true comparison between randomized 
groups cannot be made. In addition to the variable of interest, Dilantin vs 
Fos, there were 4 additional variabl9s that were not adequately 
controiled, to include: 
1. total dose in PE 
2. infusion rate (recall that the bioequivalent infusion rate for Fos 
is 3 X faster in PE than the rate for Dilantin) 
3. presence or absence of measurable baseline levels of phenytoin 
4. when present, the actual values for baseline phenytoin levels 
10/13 Dilantin pts (77%) received 800-1000 mg PE while 23/39 Fos pis 
(50%) received 800-1000 mg PE or greater. The rate was about 50 
mg/min PE for Dilantin, but Jnly 18/39 (50%} of Fos pis received 100 
mg/min or greater (100-150 mg/min is the bioequivalent rate when based 
on free phenytoin levels). 
Therefore, at this point, the question would be, of the 23 pts who :·eceived 
800 mg PE or greater, what percent of these received a rate of 100 
mg/min or greater. One might guess that only 10-12 Fos pis are available 
to compare to the 10-12 Dilantin pts (certainly noi randomized groups at 
this point); we have not even introduced the additional variable of 
background phenytoin levels ::it baseline. 
To further complica!e a:I this, we are told that 7/39 Fos pts (18%) required changes in rate compared with 6/13 Dilantin pis (46%). The 
reason for the rate changes are as follows: 
Fos 
Hypoter.sion 2 
Generalized burning or itching 4 
Infusion pump problem 1 
Dilantin 
Hypotension 1 
Localized pain or burning at inj. site 5 
C. Results 
There were no deaths in either treatment group. Three withdrawals 
occurred, all in the Dilantin group. There was 1 withdrawal for AE; there 
were 2 withdrawals for "lost-to-f/u." No AEs in either treatment group 
were rated "serious." 
Because of the multiple variables discussed above, any comparison 
between groups with regard to AEs is really inappropriate. Suffice it to 
say that the pattern of AEs seen in the Fos group raised only one unusual 
concern., the occurrence of pruritus in 30% of Fos pts vs 0% of Dilantin pts. 
Looking only at Fos pts who received a total of 1000 mg PE at rates of 100 
mg/min PE or greater, I identified 15 Fos pis in the category. Of these 
"high-dose, high-rate" pts, 3/15 or 1/5 had a rate change during the 
infusion because of an AE. One pt had hypotension, 1 had itching, and 1 had 
burning. 
D. Clinical Labs 
No clinically important differences are noted between groups and no clear 
trends toward abnormal values are evident. 
E. Vital Signs 
The sponsor's discussion of vital signs seems flc>.wed since they have 
chosen to compare baseline to the 2-hour visit. (See Sponsor's Tables 20 
1 I I and 21.) In fact, the vitals of interest are those at 5, 15, and perhaps 30 
minute.;. 
Sponsor's Table 22 shows the incidence of decreases in systolic BP > 20 
mm Hg: 7 Fos pts (18%) and 4 Dilantin pts (31%). However, the 
percentages are misleading because the true denominators for comparison 
are obscured by variable rates, total doses, ar.d baseline phenytoin levels. 
2 pts on Fos and 1 on Dilantin required ~ate changes due to hypotension. 
One of these Fos pis had a 26mmHg drop in SBP without symptoms. The 
other Fos pt had an 18mmHg drop with severe dizziness and moderate 
vertigo. The Dilantin pt had a 22mmHg drop with mild vertigo. 
F. Infusion Sites 
At the follow-up exam, investigators classified the overall appearance of 
the infusion sites. The majority of pts in both treatment groups tolerated 
the infusions, with no differences between groups noted. 
Immediately after the infusion, 50% of Dilantin pts reported some pain 
and 83% reported some burning. By comparison, 2.6% of Fos pts reported 
some pain and 10% reported some burning. Except for 2 Fos pis who 
reported pain 2 hours after the infusion, both pain and burning had 
resolved for all pis in each treatment group by the end of double-blind 
treatment. 
Investigators rated erythema, swelling, tenderness, necrosis, and bruising 
on a 4 point scale. Essentially no differences between treatment groups 
emerged. 
F. Conclusions 
Because the 2 drugs were mixed and administered the same way during 
this trial, nothing was learned about relative ease-of-use. 
Rates were faster for Fos on average, but the sponsor's discussion avoids 
the issue that where rate is important, Fos must be given faster than it 
was in this study and may, under those conditions of use, be associated with more AEs (both local and systemic) than were seen here. Rate is not 
important for maintenance loading and, in that clinical situation, the 
ability to administer a drug faster may not necessarily be an advantage. 
This study provides some safety information in support of a subacute JV 
loading dose of Fas in non-emergent situations where the physician 
wishes to achieve therapeutic levels of phenytoin more rapidly than could 
be achieved by the oral route. Any comparison between the Fas loading and 
Dilantin loading was obscured by the study design as discussed above. TABLE IS. Most Frequent Adverse Events With IV Administration to

The study was intended to be a safety study. The projected enrollment 
was 60 patients. 
Patients were to require a loading dose of phenytoin for the treatment or 
prophylaxis of seizures. Open-label treatment was to consist of a single 
loading dose, minimum 10 mg/kg PE. This was followed by a 3-hour 
observation period. Patients were to return in 2-7 days for follow-up 
exams and procedures. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria dictated that patients be 12 years of age or 
older. Pts were not to be in serious or life-threatening condition. This 
excluded patients in status epilepticus from the s:.;.1dy. 
Not excluded were pis already being treated with phenytoin. Prior 
phenytoin usage was to be assessed when determining dosing 
requirements. If that information was unavailable, the investigator was 
to use clinical Judgment to decide on a dose. 
The dosing administration could be divided and given in separate locations 
on the buttock. B. Subject Disposition and Baseline Comparison 
The study was conducted between August 1992 and February 1993. 
60 patients (34 male, 26 female) entered the study. 57 completed all tho 
follow-up assessments. 32 pis were white; 24 were black; 1 was Asian. 
The mean age was 43 years with a range 16-80 years. 
The reasons for loading dose were as follows: 
Noncompliance 11 
First treatment with phenytoin .i 8 
Decreased phenytoin level (unknown reason) 1 3 
Decreased phenytoin level (prescribed dose reduction) 9 
Other reason 9 
Therefore, IM loading in the face of absent plasma phenytoin occurred in 
~'bout 27 patients. The other 33 patients had the potential to :iave low but 
measurable levels of phenytoin and might therefore have received 
downward adjusted doses (based on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator). AEDs taken within 3 days of study entry :ncluded phenytoin 
in 27 patients. Only 23 patients took no AEDs within 3 days of study 
entry. 
A review of concurrent AEDs taken from day oi Fos loading to follow-up 
follows: 
None 1 0 
Phenytoin 47 
Carbamazepine 10 
VPA 1 0 
Lorazepam 5 
Phenobarbital 2 
Clorazepate 2 
Methsuximide 1 
Acetazolamide 1 
This list reminds us that the follow-up assessments done after the day of 
Fos dosing will be obscured by the use of these other drugs and, in fact, 
might be more representative of these AEDs than tha Fos itself. 
The doses of Fos ·anged from 350 to 1500mg (3.6 to 20.2 mg/kg) PE. 22 
'" patients received a loading dose of 12 mg/kg or greater. An additional 25 
pts received a loading dose between 10-12 mg/kg. The actual doses were 
between a gram and 1600 mg for 16 pts; 20 pts received between 800 to 
1000 mg. Note that the 12 pts who received less than 10 mg/kg of Fos 
were actually in violation of the protocol requirement that pts receive at 
least 10 mg/kg. 
Doses were given as a single injection for 28 pts. 28 pts had their doses 
divided into 2 injections. 4 pts received 3-4 injections. 
C. Results 
No patient died during the study. Withdrawals in the true sense of the 
word could not occur since the Fos was given as a loading dose. 
Only one patient experienced serious AEs: arrhythmia, neuropathy, stupor, 
and tachycardia. This was also the only pt who experienced AEs that were 
graded severe in intensity. He was a 74 year old man with a history of a 
stroke with complex partial seizures. He received IM Fos on Day 1. On Day 
4. he experienced an irregular pulse, deterioration in neurological status, 
stuporous condition, and tachycardia. None of these were considered 
related to study medication by the investigator. The pt had not yet 
recovered from these AEs by the end of the study. 
66% of pts experienced some AEs. Most of these were considered 
associated with use of Fos. Almost all these AEs were considered mild in 
intensity. 
Nystagmus was the most common AE, occurring in 47% of pis. Dizziness 
and ataxia occurred in 17% and 13% of pis respectively. 
Evaluation of injection sites revealed that only 3 pts had mild injection 
site irritation 3 hours after IM dosing. 4 pts had mild irritation 2-7 days 
later at the follow-up visit. Only 1 pt had mild irritation at both time 
points. The sponsor states that no relationship was found between the 
dose or the number of in1ections and the tendency toward this mild 
irritation. D. Conclusions 
This study demonstrated no drug-related serious AEs, either systemically 
or locally at the injection site, when Fos was given IM at relatively high 
doses. 47 pis received 10 mg/kg or greater. However, only 28 pts 
received the entire loading dose at a single injection site and some of 
these may have received less than 10 mg/kg. Because of this last point, 
this study would probably best support the safety of IM Fos at comparable 
doses with the total dose divided and given at two separate injection 
sites. 
Note that patients who required an emergeni loading dose of phenytoin 
were excluded from this study. In particular, pts with status were 
excluded. Thus, this study would not support the efficacy of IM Fos in 
emergent situations. Likewise, there is no data that I am aware of to 
support use of IM Fos loading over PO Fos loading. In fact, IM Fos loading 
would probably only have a role in non-emergent settings where patients 
could not tolerate PO feedings. This might occur in patients chronically 
treated with AEDs (especially phenytoin) who develop transient 
gastrointestinal illnesses that preclude continued oral medication and 
result in dropping plasma AED levels. 
At a minimum, although this study was designed to support the safety of 
IM loading, the data from this study can be used to support the safety of 
IM maintenance dosing. That is, if the higher doses given in this study 
were tolerated, the lower doses necessary for IM maintenance dosing 
should have a wider safety margin.

It was pointed out in our team meeting for this new drug that the in vivo 
hydrolysis o ·9653 occurs in 2 steps, producing one mole of formaldehyde 
for each mole of prodrug. Jn the fnftfal clinical Phase I trial, the top dose 
of 2250 mg would produce 5.5 111110les of HCHO. 'flle possible hazard from this 
burden will ue discussed from several different veiwpofnts below. All 
calculations are gross approximations, based on available information, 
1. OSHA has adopted a p~rmissible exposure level for toxic effects of 
forma lciehyde other tha1. cancer of 3 ppm as an 8 hour time weighted 
average, anu 10 ppm maximum peak concentration for 30 mi~utes in an 8 
hour period (Third Annual Report on Carcinogens, USDHHS Public Health 
Servic:e, September, 1!183, oage 73). It ha~ been repgrteu that workers 
exposed to formaldehyde at a concentration of 7 mg/nr' developed blood 
levels of 0.6 • 4.0 msfl, The duration of exposure was not given 
(J.Piotrowski, Exposure Tests for Organic Compaounds in Industrial 
Toxicology, Gant Print in~ Office, DC, 1977, p. 122). (lm3 = 1000 i; wt. 
of air= 1.2~3 gms/1 at ooc + 760 mm Hg; therefore 7 mg/m3 = 7 
n1sf1.i:!13 kg= 5.4 mg/kg= 5.4 ppm iri air:i 
Since 5.4 ppm of HCH07 a madmum of 4 mg/1 in blood, the 10 ppm maximum 
a 11oweu by OSHA would-7 approximat<:i; 7.4 mg HCHO/liter or 0.25 meq 
HCHO/l in blood. Tili> figure shoulo more or less represent the maximal 
allowable blood level of HCHO accordinf to OSHA. If we then assume that 
the 5.5 mmoles of HCHO that are split rom the prodrug all appear in the 
circulation lave. volume 5 liters) the concentration would be 33 mg/1 or 
1.l me /l or a roximate1 4 fold hf her than the OSHA level allowed. 
owever, t s is a very cru e es lmate s1nce t e ata are not rea 1 y 
available for taking the time factor alloweo under the OSHA limit ir.to 
considerlltion. 
2. There is a great deal of information fn the literature that suggests that it is formic acid that is repsonsible for the ocular toxicity and 
acidosis seen following acute methanol poisoning (methano' ---7 
formaldehyde-? formate). This toxicity would be of greater concern when 
dealing with a drug to be u~ed acutely than would potential 
carcinogenicity. Although a role for HCHO has not been clearly ruled 
out, experil!Y~nts in monkey~ ~u99est that the resulttnt formate levels are 
of more concern. 
119 IND Page 2 
In a model in rhesus monkeys for inethanol ocular toxicity and metabolic 
acidosis, formate blood and CSF levels of 7 to 34 meg/l were associated 
with optic disc .?dema, mor'phologica1 alterabons in optic nerve and 
swelling of olf~odendroglial cytoplasm (Martin -Amat, Hayreh, Baumtach 
et al, Arch Ophthalmol., 95, 1847-50, 1851-58, 1859-61; Hartin-Amat, 
et.al., TAP, 45, 201-ZOS-;-"1978). Pretreat11111nt with folate increased the 
metabolism of l'Ormate and decreased the toxicity (HcHartfn et al, JPET, 
~01, 564-572, 1977). In the prop~~~~ clinical trial, if we assume the 
!":'! meq of HCHO goes to 5.5 meq of formate, with a blooa concentration of 
1. 1 meq/1, there is a minimum of a 7-folu safet~ factor before ocular 
toxicity occurred in the monkey (wh1cfi is thoug t to metabolize HCHO like 
the human). 
3. It has been reported that the mechanism for ocular toxicity caused by 
methanol fs the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by formate (Nicholls, 
SBRC, 67, 610-616, 1975). Since cytochrome oxfdase activity is low in 
white iiii~ter, it has been suggesteo that its activity may be critical in 
that tissue. The Kf values 'determined for formate inhibition of 
cytachrorne oxidase are between 5 and 30 m R (above reference plus 
Mart.n-klat, Arch Ophtfiol., 95, 1847-50, ·1977). Based on this data, 
blood levels of formate of 17T m M would be somewhat lower then those 
expected to produce tox1citt. 
4. In dogs and cats administered 35 mg/kg (1.2 meq/kg) of formaldehyde by 
i.v. Infusion, a blood HChO concentration of 25 mg/1 (0.83 meq/l) was 
produced which declined to about l my/1 by 1 hour after the infusion. t4 
x as much HCHO was in erythrocytes as in plasma). The en~ plasma -
concentration of formate, however, was 144 mg/1 (3. 1 meq at the end of 
the infusion, which declined with a Tl/2 of 1.5 hours. Toxicity was 
not addressed (G. Malornej et al, Naunyn -Schmiedebergs A.E.P.P., 250, 
419-436, 1965). These data would suggest that peak levels of the ~ 
possibly more toxic metabolite, formate, might be approximated as follows 
for top dose in the clinical trial: 
5.5 meq of HCHO (155 mg) = 3 "'~/~g in a 50 kg pt:rson. Jf 35 mg/kg 
of i.v. HCHO -:'144 m91 of for~ate, 3 mg/kg or HCliO may result in 
'eak blood levels of formate of 12 m or 0.26 me /1. (This is 
assuming compara e re at1ve oo ev es to o y weight in humans 
and animals. Actually, dogs may have slightly larger blood 
volume/kg of body weight than humans, so the estimate for humans is 
possibly on the low side. The as~uF:tion for comparable metabolism 
is also made). 
This figur~is considerab1y lower than the Ki for formate inhibition of 
cytochrome oxidase and it is about 25-30 fold lower than the lowest 
levels of formate associated with ocular toxicity in monkeys (see numbers 
2 and 3 above). If instead, we examine the blood HCHO concentration 
using these data, an i.v. dose of prodrug that yields 5.5 mmoles of HCHO 
(0.11 111nOles/k9) would be expected to result in a peak blood 
concentration of HCHO of 0.08 mmoles/1iter, or 1/3 of the maximal 
allowable HCHO exposur~ according to oSRA. 
Ev3luation and Reco111nendations: 
lhe above approximations are extremely crude, but they do provide some data 
for evaluating the risk involved from a drug which will be used acutely that 
is metabolized to pruduce a mole of formalaehyde for every mole of d~ug. .-l NU 
Based on OSHA limits for exposure to formaldehyde, the guestimate is that the 
top dose of prodrug planned in the rising dose trial (2250 mg) would result in 
anywhere from 1/3 of1l>Ytimes the maximal allowable blood level of 
formaloehyde. If we· assume that formate is responsible for the expected acute 
toxicty (occ~lar and acidosis), there may be anywhere between a 7 fold and a 
30 fold safety factor, based on toxicity observed in monkeys and blood levels 
of formate measured after i.v. administration of HCHO to dogs. If we believe 
that forlllilte toxicity occurs through cytochrome oxidase inhibition, there is 
at least a small margin of safety based on the Ki. 
In any case, it is a cl~se call, and there are a couple of precautions that 
might be considered. Monitoring of blood formic acid, blood pH, bicarbonate 
and pCOz is recOlllllended. Since folinfc acid pretreatment hastens the 
elimination rate, a supplement of 2 mg, p.o., might be given the day before 
the trial. However, ff ft is considered that this fs an appropriate time to 
determine whether or not formate levels in blood are detectable (since fn 
practice there would not be time to give folinic acid} I would reco11111end 
careful monitoring for formate levels at ali doses before proceeding to the 
next higher dose. SRO is Hay 4, so sponsor should be phoned.

2 -· I. PHARMACODYNAMICS 
Anticonvulsant ActiVity 
A) EFFECTS ON MES-INDUCED SEIZURES IN MICE (RR 740-02904, NOA Vol. 1.9). 
1. After iv dosing wilh phenytoin (8 mg/kg) or fosphenytoin (11.9 mg/kg), no appreciable 
anticonvulsant activity was seen tor either drug until 10 min, when 50% (4/8) of pt1emytoin­
treated mice were protected from tonic hindlimb extension (THE) and 13% (1/8) of 
fosphenytoin-treated mice were protected {Table 1.1 ). 
2. Peak activity was reached for both compounds at 30 min wt1en tl3% (5/8) of phenytoin­
treated and 88% of fosphenytoin-treated mice were protected (Table 1.1 ). In addition to 
reducing the incidence of MES-induced THE. phenytoin and fosphenf.oin reduced seizure 
duration. 
3. When dose-response determinations were made at 10 and 30 min (Table 1.2), both drugs 
exerted dosHependent protection from ME5-induced THE. The iv ED50 values (95% 
confidence limits) were 8.3 mg/kg (6.1-11.2) at 10 min and 6 6 mg/kg (5.1-8.0) at 30 min after 
dosing with phenytoin, compared to 10.8 mg/kg (8.4-17.5) at 10 min and 6.8 mg/kg (6.1-7.5) 
at 30 min after dosing with tosphenytoin (dosE>s expressed as phenytoin equivalents). Neither 
~ehicle was active. Based on statistical comparisons of lhe dose-response curves and 
potency ratios, the anticonvulsant potencies of fosphenytoin and phenytoin against MES· 
induced THE were not srgn~ntly different at eilher time poin~ although lhere were apparent 
differences in low dose activity and onset of action. 
4. The E050 values for iv phenytoin and fosphenytoin were in agreement with those reported 
in the literature for oral (9.0 and 12.8 m')/kg), !C (7.2 mglkg), ant\ 1p (9.5 mg/kg) 
administration of phenytoin to mice and for oral (11.8 mg/kg PE) and ip (10.3 mg/kg PE) 
administration of the prodrug to mice.

Cardiovascular effects 
A) ANTIARRHYTHMIC ACTIVITY IN VlTRO ANO IN VIVO (RR 740-02905, Vol. 9). 
In Yitro, tosphenytoin had not antiarrtlylhmic effect in acetytstrophanthidin-treated guinea pig right atria 
at concE>ntrations up to 400 uM, while phenytoin restored rhythmic beating In 4 of 7 atria at a mean 
EC50 of 20 uM. In vivo, fosphenytoin and phenytoin exerted similar antiarrhylhmic acliVity, 
respectively converting oubain-induced tachycardia in 87 and 100 % of animals after an infUsion time 
o• 8.5 and 7 min, at administered doses of 24.3 and 14.1 mg/kg, and plasma levels of 18 and 29.5 
uglml of phenytoin. This indicates thc:t fosphenytoin has no direct antiarrhylhmic action, but is similar 
to phenytoin under 1:i vivo conditions, presumably due to enzymatic conversion to phenytoin. 
B) HEMODYN.AMIC EFFECTS IN ANESTHETIZED DOGS (RR 740-0290€, Vol. 9). 
1. Fosphenytoin (60 mg/kg) infused over 2 min (infusion rate of 20 mg/kg/min) produced marked 
reductions in systolic (50%} and diastolic (60%) blood pressure, heart rate (25%), and 
LvdPld\ (70%). The maximum elleds were observed 10 min after termination of infUsion and 
had returned towartt normal t1-f 60 min. After rapid infusion of an equimolar dose of phenytoin 
(40 mg/kg}. changes in CV parameters were comparable to those seen after fosphenytoin 
(Figures 1.1 & 1.2). Effects on CV parameters appeare<l somewhat more pronounced after 
fc~phenytoin (diastolic BP was significantly lower in fosphenytoin group at 4 min}; however, 
3 of the phenytoin animals died within 4 min from onset of infusion, while all 6 losphenyloin 
dogs recovered. 
2. Plasma levels of fosphenytoin were highest at ~.e end of the infusion, while peak levels of 
formed phenytoin were seen at about 8 min alter the end of infusion (Figure 1.3). Peak 
i:;lasma phenytoin leiels (free leVels not detennined} were reached more rapidly after Infusion 
oi phenytoin than after fosphenytoin, elthough maximal levels achieved were similar. 
3. Fosphenytoin (31 mg/kg} Infused over 15, 20. or 30 min produced significant reductions in 
systolic (25%) and diastolic (35%\ blood pressure, HR (10%). left \'!mlricular contraclility

(lvdP/dt, 20-45%). and cardiac output {20-40%) at all three infusion 1ates (Flgul'ff 1.4 and 
LS). The maximum effects were comparable at each infusion rate and the maximum effects 
were observed at the end of each infusion period. In each group, pressures had returned t" 
normal by 60 min. There were no significant effects on systolic blood pressure, heart rate, left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure, or cardiac output Comparable changes in CV parameters 
were seen when an equimolar dose of phenytoin (21 mg/kg) was infused over 30 min. 
4. Analysis of plasma sampleS showed that maximum levels of fosphenytoin occurred at the 
end of the infusion period (Figure 1.6). Peak fosphenytoin levels of 106, 82, and, 72 ug/ml 
were attained after infusion over 15, 20, and 30 min, respectively. The maximum levels of 
phenytoin were also observed at the end of the infusion period. Peak levels of phenytoin were 
35, 29, and 31 ug/ml after infusion of fosphenytoin over 15, 20, and 30 min, respectively. 
Plasma levels declined rapidly thereafter. After infusion of phenytoin, plasma levels of 
phenytoin were maximal (33 ugtml) at the end of infusion, and i:leclined thereafter.

C) EFFECTS ON GUINEA PIG ATRl.A, IN VITRO (RR 740-02907, Vol. 9). 
1. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin both produced concentration-dependent decreases in the rate 
of spontaneous beating in right atrial preparations and both produced complete arrest 
2. Arrest occurred at a much lower concentration of phenytoin (100 uM) than of fosphenytoin 
(3000 uM). The EC50's for depression of spontaneous rate were 41 uM (11 ug/ml) for 
phenytoin and 535 uM (217 ug/ml) for fosphenytoin. 
3. Both drugs produced similar concentration-dependent reductions in contractile force in 
electrically driven left atria (Figure 1.7) . The EC50 for cardiodepression was similar for each: 
98 uM (27 uglml) for phenytoin and 105 uM (43 uglml) for fosphenytoin. The vehicles 
depressed developed contractile force <20% at their highest concentrations. 
4. This study indicated that under in vitro conditit'ns in which less than 1% of phenytoin was 
present fosphenytoin had a cardiac depressant effect similar to that of phenytoin in guinea 
pig left atrial preparations. The difference between effects on left and right atria is 
unexplained. Thus, the prodrug is a myocardial depressant under certain experimental 
conditions. The relevance of this finding to in vivo administration is unknown.

Single-dose absorption and phannacokinetics 
A) BLOOD LEVELS AFTER IMAOMINISTRATION TO RATS (RR 764-01612, Vol. 1.10). 
Groups of 4 JT1ale rats (CO-Sprague-Dawley) were giVen 115, 250, 370, or 500 mg/kg of fosphenytoin 
or 77. 169, 250, or 337 mg/kg of phenytoin (equimolar doses) by im injection. Blood samples were 
collected from each rat at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6. and 24 hr post-<lose. Analysis was by HPLC. 
Peak -:ooc.t concentrations of fosphenytoin were achieved at 30 min after im administration and 
averaged 9.6, 12.5. 21.4, and 19.6 uglml after doses of 115, 250, 370, and 500 mg/kg, respectively. 
Blood levels of fosphenytoin were still quantifiable at 6 hr in the 3 highest dose groups. Blood 
concentrations of phenytoin after im fosphenytoin peaked at 90 min and averaged 42.3, 112, 127, and 
153 ug/ml at the respectiVe doses. Corresponding peak levels after phenytoin administration were 
14.9, 20.1. 31.2, and 33.2 uglml at 30 min after dosing. Thus. fosphenytoin administration resulted 
in phenytoin levels 5-SX higher than those produced by an equimolar dose of phenytoin, indicating 
greater bioavailability of phenytoin after im administration of fosphenytoin. 
B) PHENYTOIN PHARMACOKINETICS ANO BIOAVAILABILITY AFTER N ADMINISTRATION OF 
EQUIMOLAR DOSES OF PHENYTOIN OR FOSPHENYTOIN TO DOGS (RR 764-01606, Vol. 10). 
Five dogs were administered equimolar iV doses of phenytoin (10 mg/kg) or fosphenytoin (14.8 mg/kg) 
in a two-way crossover study designed to compare the pharrnP.~okinetics and bioavailability of 
phenytoin after each drug (Table 11.1 ). Analysis was by HPLC . 
.A.fter N administration offosphenytoin. fosphenytoin t1/2, Vd, and AUC value·• averaged 2.6 min, 150 
r1lllkg, and 255 ug min/ml, respectively. The Cl of 40.2 mVminlkg approximates the hepatic blood flow 
1n dogs, which would be consistent with metabolism to phenytoin by phosphatases present in tissues 
such as kidney and liVer. Conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin was rapid in dogs; the formation 
t1/2 averaged C.42 min and the peak phenytoin levels (mean 6.98 uglml) were reached at 3.3 min. 
During the first 30 min after administration of phenytoin. phenytoin levels were higher than after 
administra:ion of fosphenytoin. but levels were similar !hereafter. The elimination t1/2, Cl, Vd, and 
AUC of phenyto1n were not significantly different after iv administration of fosphenytoin and phenytoin 
sodium. The bioavailability of phenytoin after iV fosphenytoin administration averaged 97.7%

56. 1 % of the dose after fosphenytoin and phenytoin, respectively. Less than 5% of the dose was 
ehminated as phenytoin and 5-(p-hydroxyphenyt)-5-phenythydantoin after administration of either 
compound, and fosphenytoin was not detected in 24 and 48-hr urine samples. 
C) PHENYTOIN PHARMACOKlNETICS AND RELATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY AFTER IM 
ADMINISTRATION OF PHENYTOIN OR FOSPHENYTOIN TO DOGS (RR 764--01601, Vol. 1.1!l). 
Five dogs were administered equimolar im doses of phenytoin (10 mg/kg) or fosphenytoin (14.8 
mg/kg) in a tNrJ.way crossover study to compare the pharma<:Okinetics and bioavailability of phenytoin 
after each (Tables 11.2 and 11.3). Samples were analyzed by HPLC. 
After im administralion, fosphenytoin levels reached a mean peak of 20.4 ug/ml at 9 min, then rapidly 
decreased such that fosphenytoin was not detectatlle in plasma after 120 min (Table 11.3). The 
absorption and elimination t112 values averaged 3.2 arid 17.4 min, respectively. The appearance of 
phenytoin m the plasma was fairly rapid after im administration of fosphenytoin. The fonnabon t112, 
Cmax, and tmax were 24. 7 min, 6.8 ug/ml, and 76.9 min, respectively (Table 11.2). The corresponding 
values after im administration of an equimolar dose of phenytoin were 17.4 min, 2.16 ug/ml. and 68.1 
min for the absorption t112, Cmax. and tmax. respectively. The elimination t112 and apparent volume 
of distribution of phenyto1n after fosphenytoin administration averaged 164 min and 1058 ml/kg, 
respectively, which were s1gnificantly different than corresponding values of 369 min and 4086 ml/kg, 
respectively, obtained after im pllenytcin. The differences probably reflect precipitation and deposition 
of phenytoin at the injection site. 
The AUC values obtained after administration of phenytoin were substantially lower when compared 
to the phenytoin AUCs after fosphenytoin administration. From 0 to 720 mir., the AUC values 
averaged 2091 and 960 ug.minlml after fosphenytoin and phenytoin sodium, respectively. When 
extrapolated to infinity, the corresponding AUC values averaged 2236 and 1336 ug.min/ml. 
respectJvely. These findings show that the bioavailability of phenytoin administered . is fosphenytoin 
was increased compared to 1m phenytoin sodium, and that the relative bioavaila~··i!ity was time 
dependent. again 1nd1cating that phenytoin was retained at the i11jeclion site and slowly released.

Analysis of 48-hr urine samples collected after administration of phenytoin or fosphenytoin indicated 
similar metabolite elimination profiles. Approximately 58% of the dose was recovered in 48-hr 
cumulative unne after dosing with fosphenytoin and about 47.4% of the dose was recovered after 
phenytoin. The major me•abolite was the g!ucuronide conjugate of 5-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-5-
phenylhydantoin (m-HPPH), which accounted for 90% of the material recovered in urine in both 
cases. 
D) FOSPHENYTOIN AND PHENYTOIN PHARMACOKJNETICS AND BIOAVAJLABILITY AFTER IV OR 
IM ADMINISTRATION OF FOSPHENYTOIN TO DOGS (RR 7~1609, Vol 10). 
Fosphenytoin (14.8 mg/kg) was administered iv to 5 dogs, and PK parameters (HPLC analysis) were 
compared to those determined in the previous im study (Table 11.3 and 11.4). 
After iv administration, fosphenytoin levels averaged 220 ug/ml at 0.6 min after dosing, then rapidly 
declined in a biphasic manner. The distribution and elimination t1r..! averaged 1.8 and 9.5 min, 
respectively. The absorption t112, Cmax. and trnax after im administration were 3.2 min, 20.4 ug/ml, 
and 9.1 min, respectively. The elimination 1112 and Vd were greater than the corresponding iv values. 
The bioavailability of im fosphenytoin was 100% based on AU Cs.

Distribution, Metabolism, and Eiimination 
A) TISSUE DISTRIBUTION IN RATS (RR 764-01600, Vol. 1.10). 
The tissue distribution of 14C-fosphenytoin was examined in 36 male rats after a single iv bolus dose 
of 10 mg/kg. The distribution of total radioactivi~ into various tissues was very rapid. For blood, 
heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen the highe~t amount of total radioactivity was seen within the 
first 5 min. The highest levels in brain, carcass, eyes, intestines, skin/hair, stomach, testes, and 
urinary bladder occurred at 20, 20, 30, 90, 30, 10, 60, and 60 min, respectively. The highest levels 
~of radioactivity in the intestines, kidneys, liver, carcass. and skin/t;air averaged 52.1, 1.9, 14.5, 32.6, 
and 22 .1 % of the dose, respectively. Only 0.2% of the dose was found in the brain at 5 and 60 min 
after dosing, and the amount of radioactivity decline1 rapidly thereafter. 
Rapid elimination of total radioactivity was observed from blood and all tissues. At 24 hr the highest 
rad;.oaclivity was in the carcass and intestines (2.1 and 4.7% of the dose, respectively); the 
radioactivity in all other tissues including blood was less than 1% of the dose. At 48 hr after dosing, 
less than 1.4% of the dose remained in all tissues. The tissue/blood total radioactivity ratio was above 
1 or close to 1 in the heart, intestines, kidneys, liver, lungs, and stomach over the entire study period. 
The highest tissue/blood ratios were in intestines> stomach> liver> urinary bladder> kidneys> lungs. 
Radio-HPLC analysis of blood, intestines. kidney, and liver samples showed three radioactive peaks, 
which were identified as a mixture of p-HPPH glucuronide and an unkriown metabolite, p-HPPH, and 
phenytoin, based on their retention times after beta-glucuronidase treatment. In brain, the radioactive 
peak corresponding to p-HPPH glucuronide was absent m-HPPH was not detected in blood or any 
of the 4 tissues examined. The prodrug was rapidly converted to phenytoin. At 5 min after dosing, 
fosphenytoin was not <:letectable in brain, intestines, kidneys, and liver, and only a trace amount was 
detected in blood. The tissue/blood ratio for phenytoin was above one in liver, kidneys, and inteslmes, 
and was close to one in brain at several of the later time points after administration. Pharrnacokinet1c 
parameters were determined after the concentration-time profiles of phenytoin in blood, brain. 
intestines, kidneys and liver had been fitted to appropriate pharmacokinetic m"'ldels. The elimination 
half-lives of phenytoin in blood. brain. intestines, kidneys, and liver were determined to be 72.8. 59.8, 
52.6. 90.1, and 70.3 min, respectively. The ehminalion t1/2 for blood agrees very closely with 
published data (Varia and Ste1la).

B) MASS BALANCE AFTER IV ADMINISTRATION TO RATS (RR 764-0160B, Vol. 1.10). 
The metabolism and excretion of 14C-fosphenytoin were studied in 10 male rats following iv 
administration of 10 mg/kg. At 24 hr aiter dosing, 86.9% of the dose was recovered, with 46. 7% in 
uri'le and 40.2% in feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of radioactivity over 72 hr averaged 
51.7% and 47.7% of the dose, respectively. These results are consistent with what has been reported 
for DPH. In the 24 hr urine sample, a large fraction of the radioactivity was in the fonm of polar 
met:lbolites. In contrast 24-hr fecal samples contained morP non-polar metabolites. In the 24-48 and 
48-72 hr urine and fecal samples. a larger percentage of the dose was eliminated as nonpolar 
metabolites. When separated by HPLC, the polar fracbor was found not to contain any unchanged 
fosphenytoin. Three radioactive peakS were detected in this fraction; the major urinary metabolite was 
a glucuronide conjugate of p-HPPH. Two additional peaks were not identified. One major and two 
minor metabolites were detected in the nonpolar fraction of urine. The maier metabolite was identified 
as p-HPPH, and one of the minor metabolites was phenytoin. One nonpolar metabolite remained 
unidentified. The nonpolar fraction of feces contained the same unknown minor metabolite detected 
in urine and a major metabolite identified to be p-HPPH. So, fosphenytoin was cleared entirely by 
metabolism; only a trace amount of phenytom was recovered in urine;> 40% of the dose was 
recovered in unne and feces as the glucuronide conjugate of p-HPPH. Metaoolism appears identical 
to that of phenytoin, ie, nng oxidation and glucuronidabon, followed by renal and biliary excretion of 
the metabolites. 
C) IN VITRO HYDROLYSIS IN HUMAN, DOG, AND RAT BLOOD AND TISSUES (RR 764-01597, Vol. 
1 .11) 
In vitro conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin was examined in rat, dog, and human tissue5 and 
whole blood. Incubation of fosphenytoin with whole blood and various tissues from rats resulted in the 
11pid disappearance of prodrug with a concomitant appearance of equimolar amounts of phenytoin. 
Klc'neys, small intestines, and liver exhibited the highest phosphatase activily. Dog and human blood 
hydrolyzed the drug much more slowly. Mean in vitro half-lives of fosphenytoin in rat, dog, and human 
whole blood were 5.89, 321, and 189 minutes, respect\vely. Faster prodrug conversion was observed 
in dog tissue homogenates, with the small intestine, kidney, and liver again the most active in 
mediating hydrolysis of the prodrug. In vitro studies with partially purified alkaline phosphatase (bovine 
liver and dog intestines) and acid phosphatase (bovine) revealed that fosphenytoin was a better 
substrate for alkaline than for acid phosphatase. 
D) PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING OF FOSPHENYTOIN (RR 764-01620, Vol. 1.11) 
The protein binding of 14C-fosphenytoin to dog and human plasma was determined by the 
ultrafiltration method. Mean percentages of fosphenytoin (at a concentration of 20 ugiml) bound to 
human and dog plasma proteins were 95. 7 and 91.3%, respectively, indicating that the drug is highly 
protein bound at therapeutic concentrations. Albumin accounted for 88 % of the fosphenytoin bindinq 
to human plasm.~ proteins. Varying the concentrations of albumin from 25 to 50 mg/ml significanily 
increased the % fosphenytoin bound from 81 to 90.5. Binding of 20 ug/ml to human ;clpha-acid 
glycoprotein (0.2 to 2 mg/ml) was independent of protein concentration, with percent bound averaging 
13 2%. Binding of fosphenyto1n to human albumin, 40 mg/ml, decreased linearly from 81 to 67% when 
concentrations of fosphenytoin increased from 6 to 200 ug/ml. 
The effect of fosphenytoin on the plasma protein t:inding of phenytoin was studied by comcubatin9 
DPH at various concentrations of fosphenytoin (7.5-500 ug/;nl). Phenytoin binding dE>creased with 
increasing fosphenytoin concentrations. At a DPH concentration of 5 ug/ml, the lree fraction of 
phenytoin increased from 4 to 18% when the fosphenytoin concentrations increased from 7. 5 to 500 
ug/ml. These results indicate that at high concentrations. fosphenytoin may enhance the 
pharmacological or toxicological effects of phenytoin by displacing DPH from i!s binding sites. 
14 ~. 
Drugs highly bound to albumin, such as phenylbutazone. sulfisoxazole, or warfann, can displace 
fosphenytoin from binding sites on albumin. When toxic concentrations of AEDs such as PHB, DPH, 
or VPA were added to plasma, the drugs sig('ificantly increased (5-20%) the free fraction of 
fosphenytoin. Diazepam, phenytoin, and carbamazepine at a concentration of <10 ug/ml did not 
change the free fraction of fosphenytoin. Since fosphenytoin has little intrinsic pharmacological effec~ 
the changes in free fraction should have no dinical significance. Addition of fosphenytoin at equimolar 
concentrations ID carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or VPA resulted in small but significant displacement 
of these drugs from its plasma binding sites. The degree of displacement of diazepam or 
carbamazepine was not enhanced by increasing the concentration of fosphenytoin 30-80-fold. The 
slight increase in free fraction of these drugs caused by fosphenytoin is unlikely to have clinical 
significance. 
Toxicokinetics 
A) TOXICOKINETICS IN RATS FOLLOWING SINGLE IM OR IV DOSES (RR 764-02096, Vol. 1.11) 
Plasma phenytoin concentrations were determined in serial blood samples collected for 32 hr after 
administration of single im or iv doses of 150 mg/kg fosphenytoin to Wistar rats (5/sex). While peak 
plasma levels were greater after iv administration, concentration-time profiles appeared similar 
between routes after Cmax was reached. Phenytoin mean Cmax values following im fosphenytoin 
were 50-60% lower than those after iv fosphenytoin (Table 11.5). Mean tmax values were 10-15X 
greater after im administration. Eliminalion t1/2 averaged 2.4 (im) and 5.3 (iv) hr in males and (18 (im) 
and 21 (iv) hr in females. Mean AUC values were 331 (im) and 404 (iv) ug hr/ml in males and 649 
(im) and 611 (iv) in females. Thus, sex differences in phenytoin pharmacokinetics were seen, peak 
phenytoin levels were redu':E!d after im administration relative to iv administration. and total phenytoin 
exposure was similar following im or iv administration of the same dose.

Phenytom kinetics were determined after single 1m or iv doses of 50 mg/kg fosphenytoin to beagle 
dogs (Table 11.6) Senal blood samples were collected for 32 hr after dosing. Mean Cmax and tmax

was attained, plasma phenytoin concentration-time profiles were similar for both routes. Mean 
elimination t1/2 values were essentially the same following im (2.8 hr) and iv (3 hr) administration. 
Mean AUC values following im and iv administration were also comparable, aver-dging 159 and 163

01727, 745-01725, 745-01721, 745-01728, 74~-01729; Vol. 1.12) 
Results of acute iv hlxicity studies comparing fosphenytoin to phenytoin in rrnce (5/sex/group), rats 
(5/sex/group), rabbits (6/sex), and dogs (2/sex) are presented in Table 111.1. Rodents were 
administered a single dose, while non-rodents received rising doses, allOWing one or more da~s for 
recovery between doses. Doses were administered either as an iv injection or a 30 min iv infusion. 
The acute toxicity of fosphenytoin was similar to that of equimolar doses of phenytoin when both 
drugs were administered by iv infusion. However, when administered by bolus injection phenytoin 
was more potent than fosphenytcin, probably because of the more gradual rise in peak phenytoin 
levels with the later compound. Clinical signs were similar for both and included ataxia, prostration, 
convulsions, and hypokinesia in both rodent and non-rodent species. Tremors and dyspnea were 
commonly obseNed in rodenls, while struggling, salivation, and vomitinglretching were seen in dogs. 
When administered to rats by 30 min infusion, both drugs produced rigid hindlimbs, while only 
fosphenytoin produced this finding after rapid iv bolus injection. In general the times of onset and 
recovery of toxic effects were similar for both compounds except follOWing rapid iv injection to rats. 
Under these conditions, toxic effects were observed immediately after dosing with phenytoin but only 
after mean lag times of 4 to 14 min with fosphenytoin. Necropsies of rats, rabbits and dogs revealed 
no macroscopic pathology which could be attributed to drug treatment. 
Since phenytoin is commonly administered to children, the acute toxicities of fosphenytoin and 
phenytoin were compared in weanling (4 week old) and neonatal (7 days) rats. When administered 
by 30 min iv infusion to weanlings, the compounds produced similar toxic signs, which included 
ataxia, prostration, hypokinesia, sedation, piloerection, dyspnea, hypopnea, tremors, and convulsions 
(few fosphenytoin rats only). The phenytoin and fosphe:1ytoin MLD's in weanling rats were similar to 
those obtained in adult rats. Because iv injections could not be made in neonates, both neonatal and 
weanling rats were administered fosphenytoin or phenytoin ip. It was concluded from this study that 
the cicute toxicities of the two drugs were similar following ip administration, but that both were more 
toxic (lethal) in neonates. 
B) ACUTE IM TOXICITY IN RATS AND DOGS (RR 745-01738, RR 745-01742; Vol. 1.12) 
The acute toxicities of fosphenytoin and phenytoin were also compared after im administration to rats 
(3/sexldose) and dogs (3/sex). Clinical signs were noted in rats within 40 to 60 min postdose with 
both compounds. Ataxia and prostration were observed in rats with fosphenytoin doses 112 and 1 /3 
lower, respectively, on a molar basis, than those phenytoin doses producing the same signs. Deaths 
occurred between 3 and 19 hr postdose with fosphenytoin doses > 247 mg/kg (phenytoin 
equivalents), while no deaths occurred wilt> phenytoin doses up to 337 mg/kg (Table 111.2). In dogs, 
sedation and emes1s occurred with both compounds, while prostration, ataxia, and convulsion were 
seen only with fosphenytoin. Struggling during dosmg, presumably resulting from pain, was seen only 
with phenytoin. No deaths occurred in dogs at dose.s of up to 50 mg/kg of either compound. In a 
separate PK study in rats, whole blood phenytoin concentrations were consistently 5 to 6 times higher 
after administration nf fosphenytoin than with equimolar doses of phenytoin (see PK section, above). 
Thus, the greater solubility and resultant higher blood levels presumably accounted for the increased 
systemic toxicity of fosphenytoin seen in both rats and dogs. In both species, phenytoin caused 
m1ect10n site necrosis while no necrosis was observed with tosphenytoin.

18 C) FOUR-WEEK IV TOXICITY IN RATS (RR 250-01648, Vol. 1.14). 
1. Treatment 
Four groups of 18 Wistar rats/sex were given daily iv (bolus) doses of vehicle or fosphenytoin 
(30, 60, and 150 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Ten rats./sexlgrp were euthanized at the completion of 
dosing, and 5/sex/group were sacrificed after a 4 week recovery period (week 8). Three 
rats/sex/group were sacrificed 15 min postdose during week 3 for determination of whole 
blood and plasma phenytoin concentrations. All animals were observed daily for signs of 
toxicity. Body weight and food consumption were determined weekly. Detailed physical and 
ophthalmoscopic exams were performed pretest and at termination (week 4 or 8). Samples 
for hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis were obtained prior to termination. Selected 
organs were weighed, and tissues from control and HD groups and liver and injection sites 
from all groups were examined microscopically. Liver from selected con trot and HD animals 
were evaluated by EM. 
Drug lot#: CM 345120 
2. Clinical Signs and Mortalitv 
a) Alaxia or hypoactivity were observed infrequenUy in 1 and 2 MD males, respectively. 
Ataxia and hypoactivity were seen throughout the treatment phase in all HD animals. 
Salivation was noted in 3 MD and 14 HD rats. Urinary staining and dyspnea occurred 
in both sexes at the HD. The incidence of injection-related skin sores was similar in 
treated and control groups. 
b) No animals died during the study. 
3. Bodv weight and food consumption 
a) BW was decreased 18% in HD males, with a 32% reduction in weight gain during the 
dosing period. In the recovery period, BW gain was higher in HD males and there 
were no statistically significant differences at week 8. 
b) Food consumption was 14% lower in HD males and 10% higher in HD females 
compared to controls. 
4. Physical and Ophthalmoscopic exams 
No significant treatment-related effects. 
5. Hematolooy 
Small decreases in RBCs, HGB, and HGT and an increase in MCHC were seen in HD 
females at week 4 compared to controls (not considered toxicologically significant). 
6. Clinical Chemistry 
a) Increases (30-60%) in alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities 
wer'! observed in HD males and females. 
b) A 48·10 ~~crease in triglycende concentration was seen in HD males at 4 weeks. 
c) Urea wa!• slightly decreased in all treatment group males at 4 weeks (15% at HD). 
7 Urinalys:s 
No TR effects. 
19 8. Organ weigh II! · 
Statistically significant increases in absolute and relative liver weight were noted at 4 weeks 
in treated females at all doses. Relative liver weights were also increased in HO males, but 
absolute weights were lower than controls. Relative liver to BW ratios were increased at 8 
weeks in HD males and females, but there were no diff-irences in abso•ute liver weights. 
9. 9ross Patt\Q!Qgy 
Treatment-related changes in the skin at the tail injection sites were noted in HD rats at 4 
weeks and 13 weeks. 
10. Histopathol0<1X 
Changes in the liver and injection sites were seen in treated males and females at week 4. 
a) Liver -The incidence of periportal cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes was 
increased in treated males (minimal to mild) and females (mild to moderate). No 
liver abnormalities were observed in the recovery groups. 4 week liver tissue from 
selected control and HD group animals exhibited no evidence of hepatocellular injury 
by EM; however, glycogen deposition was increased in treated animals, particularly 
in a females haVing the greatest periportal vacuolization. 
b) Skin -Cutaneous necrosis and inflammation were increased at the injection sites of 
treated males and females at 4 weeks. No changes were noted at 8 weeks. 
11 . Plasma concent'ations 
Phenytoin concentrations at 15 min postdosing were proportional to dose and similar 1n 
plasma and whole blood of males and females (Table 111.3).

1 . Treatment 
Fifteen Sprague Dawley (Char1es River CD) rats/sex/group were randomly assigned to each 
of five treatment groups, to recei'le either normal saline (controls), phenytoin sodium (positive 
contrcl; 100 mgll<g in 40% propylene glyc:il and 10% ETOH), or fosptienytoin (30, 60, or 150 
mg/kg in 0. 1 M TRIS buffer) by intramuscular injection, once daily, for 13 weeks. Ten 
rats/sex/group were designated as main study animals and the remaining 5/sex/group were 
used for pharmacokinetic $tudies. The phenytoin and HO fosphenytoin gro,.ps received 
approximately equimolar doses. Because of excessive mortality, the phenytoin group was 
terminated during week 9, and all tests sch6duled for termination were carried out at that 
time. 
Drug lot #: Z86-7 -10 
2. Observed signs 
Decreased activity, leaning to one side, excessive salivation, and dilated pupils were 
observed in HD fosphenytoin animals. Only excessive salivation was observed in the MD 
group. The phenytoin group exhibited decreased activity, excessive salivation, swollen 
hindlimbs, and autocanibalism of hind limbs. 
3. Mortality 
In the phenytoin group, 8/15 male and 10/15 female rats died by week 8. In the fosphenytoin 
groups, deaths occurred in 1/15 LD females, 1/15 MO females, 2115 HD males and 1/15 HD 
females. One saline control female died. Only the phenytoin group and HD fosphenytoin 
group deaths were considered treatment-related; the others were thought to be related to the 
blood collection procedure. 
4 Body Weights and Food Consumption 
a) BWs for males and females in both the HD fosphenytoin group and the phenytoin 
group were lower than those in the saline control group throughout the treatment 
period. 
b) Food consumption (g/animal) for HO fosphenytoin group males was consistentiy 
lower than saline controls. However, when calculated relative to BW, food 
consumption values (g/kg) for both male and female HD animals were generally 
higher than those for the control group. Food consumption in the LO and MD 
fosphenytoin groups was slightly (<10%) lower than controls. In the phenytoin group, 
both absolute and relative consumption were reduced compared to controls. 
5 Hematology (routine hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis tests were conducted on 
all mam study rats during week 6 and at terminaticn) 
No treatment-related effects on hematology were observed among any of the losphenytom­
treated groups. Significant decreases in RBCs, HGB and HCT, and increases in WBCs 
observed in phenytom-treated rats were attributed to hemorrhage and infection secondary 
to autocannibalism induced by the local irritation of 1m phenytom. 
6. Clinical Chemistrv 
a) Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels were 
21 elevall9d in the HD fosphenytoin group ( x about 2-fold for all 3 in M & F). Only slight 
increases in alkaline phosphatase levels were noted in the phenyto1n group. 
b) Non-fasted glucose concentrations (from samples collected 2 hr after dosing) were 
significanUy elevated (4-fold compared to saline) in the HD fosphenytoin group. 
Phenytoin had previously been shown to induce hyperglycemia, presumably by 
inhibiting insulin release, and glucose was elevated about 2-fold in the phenytoin 
group at 9 weeks in the current study. A hyperglycemic effect has also been 
previously shown for fosphenytoin. The hyperglycemia was no longer evident by the 
time routine blood samples were collected 24 hr later. 
7. Urinalysis 
Glucosuria was observed in both the phenytoin and HD fosphenytoin groups. 
8. Organ Weights 
a) Absolute and relative liver weights were elevated in MD and HD fosphenytoin 
groups, primarily in females (70-80% in HD females). In contrast, absolute and 
relative (to brain) liver weights were decreased in the phenytoin group. 
b) Relative adrenal weights were increased in phenytoin group animals, and absolute 
adrenal weights were increased in the HD fosphenytoin group. 
c) Thymus weights were significanUy decreased in HD fosphenytoin males and 
females, while relative thymus weights were significanUy decreased in phenytoin 
group females. 
9. Gross Pathology 
Macroscopic evidence of tissue irritation at injection sites was observed in the phe11ytoin- and 
fosphenytoin-treated groups. Changes in the phenytoin group consisted of pockets of fibrous 
material, nodules, necrosis, thickened tissue, and abscesses. The lesions were bilateral and 
the intensity was moderate to severe. Also, 10115 males and 8/15 females in this group had 
missing toes or foot parts from their rear limbs. In fosphenytoin groups, changes included 
necrosis, hemormage or discolored areas, and pale, firm areas. The lesions were unilateral 
or bilateral, focal, and varied from mild to severe. The changes in the fosphenytoin groups 
were dose-related, and no signs of autocannibalism were seen. 
1 0 Microscopic Pathology 
a) Injection site -Microscopic evidence of injection site irritation, consisting of 
hemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis, mineralization, and thrombosis, was seen in 
both the phenytoin and fosphenytoin groups. The response was dose-dependent 1n 
the fosphenytoin groups, and the changes were reportedly somewhat less severe 
than in the phenytoin group. 
b) Liver. Increased intracytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes was observed in HD 
fosphenytoin animals (8/10 males, 9/10 females). This was thought to be due to 
glycogen accumulation. Single cell hepatocyte necrosis was observed i» the 
phenytoin group animals (3/10 males. 3/10 females). 
c) Thymus • Thymuses of rats in the phenytoin and HD fosphenytoin groups showed 
trace to moderate lymphoid depletion (con-elated with decreases 1n thymus weights: 
cons1nered stress-related). 
d) A few animals in the phenytoin and HD fosphenytoin groups had cortical cell 
vacuolizabon or hypertrophy of the adrenals. This was also considered stress­
related. 11 . Plasma Drug Cdncentralions 
Blood samples were collected from rats designated for blood level studies immediately prior 
to, and at 30, 60, and 120 mir. alter dosing on study days 1, 42, and at terrmnation (Table 
111.4). 
At equimolar doses, peak phenytoin levels were about 3-4 times higher following 
fosphenytoin administration than after phenytoin injection. Absorption of phenytoin was 
apparently prolonged, since significant levels were measured in this group prior to dosing on 
day42.

1 Treatment 
Four groups of beagle dogs (4/sex/group) were given daily iv bOlus doses of fosphenytoin at 
0 (vehicle-0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.8), 15, 30, or 50 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Three animals in each 
group were sacrificed after 4 weeks: the remaining dog in each group was sacrificed after a 
4 week recovery peri:xl. Animals were observed daily for signs of toxicity and systemic 
effects. Body weights Wf!nl recorded pretest, weekly, and at tenmination. Food consumption 
was assessed daily by visual inspection. Ph~'Sical and ophthalmoscopic exams were 
performed pretest and at weeks 4 and 8. Bleed pressure measurements and ECG were 
performed pretest, before and 60 mi. after dosing on day 1 and during week 4, and at 8 
weeks. Hematological, clinical chem1s<ry and urinalysis detenminations were made pretest 
and at weeks 4 and 8: Blood samples for determi11ation of phenytoin concentrations were 
collected 30 min after dosing dunng week 2. Complete necropsies were performed on all 
animals at termination after 4 or 6 -...eeks.

b) Mandibular salivary gland weights were increased in HD males and MD and HD 
females. 
c) Small (10%) increases in absolute and relative heart weights were seen in MD and 
HD males. 
1 O Gross Patholoay 
No TR changes were noted. 
11 Hrs!opathology 
a) Two HD males had minimal diffuse hypertrophy of mandibular and parobd salivary 
gland acini which correlated with salivation noted clinically and increased salivary 
gland weights. These changes were not seen in females. 
b) No differences rn the incidence or seventy of injection site alterations were noted 
between vehicle controls and treated groups. 
12. Plasma concentrations 
Mean plasma and whole blood phenytoin concentrations increased proportionately with dose.

1 Treatment 
Fosphenyto1n was administered im to beagle dogs at dose levels of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day 
for 13 weeks. A negative control group was administered saline. and a positive control group 
received phenytOin sodium on the same regimen. The phenytoin dose was 40 mg/kg, which 
was equ1molar to the high fosphenytoin dose. All groups contained 4 males and 4 female 
dogs. 
flrug lot #: ZBS-7 -10 
2. Clinical Signs 
Ataxia, decreased activity, and mucoid diarrhea were observed in the HD fosphenytoin 
group. Emes1s and ptyalism were seen in all fosphenytoin-treated dogs in a dose-related 
manner Ataxia, emes1s, and diarrhea were observed in the phenytoin group with incidences 
intermediate between that seen in the MD and HD fosphenytoin groups. Otner observations 
made in phenytoin-treated dogs include the inability to bend rear legs, thinness. swollen legs, 
and loss of appetite. Dogs in this group also struggled and vocalized during dosing. Both 
phenytoin and fosphenytoin groups exhibited swelling at the injection sites. 
3. Mortalitv 
All study animals survived until termination. 
4. Body Weight and Food Consumption 
BW gain was increased in male fosphenytoin group dogs (1.5X saline controls at HD) and 
slightly decreased in phenytoin group males and females compared to saline controls. Food 
consumptir..n was decreased in HD females and in phenytoin group males and females. 
5 Qphthalmoscopic Examination 
No treatment-related ophthalmoscopic abnormalities were detected. 
6. Physical Examination 
Signs of injection site irritation were noted in the phenytoin group only. 
7 Cardiovascular Examination 
No cardiovascular abnormalities were detected at one month or at the end of the study. 
8 Hematolog\' (pre-study and at 1 , 2, and 3 months) 
No changes in hematologic values were noted in the analysis of blood samples. However, 
one HD fosphenytoin female had an ek \Sled myeloid/erythroid ratio (M/E = 6.1) in the bone 
marrow smear performed PQfil mortem, indicative of depressed erythrogenesis. All other 
hematologic parameters were normal for this dog, however. 
9 Clinical Chemistrv (pre-study and at 1, 2, and 3 months) 
Alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in the phenytom group males and females (" 2-3-
26 fold C), in Hl1fbsphenytoin group males and females (2-3X C), and in MD fosphenytoin 
females (+60% compared to C). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were elevated in MD 
and HD !osphenytoin males (2X C), in HD fosphenytoin group females (2X C), and in 
ph,,nytoin group females (2-3X C). AST and ALT were increased in phenytoin group females 
(2 ll.). BUN was decreased in phenytoin group males and females (-30-40%). 
10. Urinalvsis (pre-study and at 1, 2, and 3 months) 
The urinalysis values for all groups were normal. 
11. Organ Weights 
A dose-related increase in liver weights occurred in fosphenytoin group males ( x+35% at HD) 
and females (+28% at HD). Liver weight was also increased in !he PC group (+28% M, 14% 
F) 
12. Macroscopic Pathology 
Injection site changes were observed in dogs from the phenytoin group and from the MD and 
HD fosphenytoin groups. These were more extensive and severe in the phenytoin group and 
consisted of abscesses, fibrous tissue masses, and multiple hemorrhages. Only 2 females 
in the MD !osphenytoin group and 2 males and 2 females in the HD group had tissue 
changes c.'1nsisting of discolored fat and muscle. edem3 between muscles, and petechial 
hemorrhage. 
13. Microscopic Pathology 
a) lnjec11on site -Microscopic changes were observed at the injection site in the 
phenyroin group and in the HD and MD ft";sphenytoin groups. Abnormalities seen at 
the injection site in phenytoin trea~eo •fogs included hemorrhage, inflammation, 
necrosis, thrombosis, mineralization :oin 1 aDscess formation. Injection site changes 
in the fosphenytoin groups were reportedly much less severe. 
b) Livers of 1 male and 1 female from the phenytoin group and of all females from the 
HD fosphenytoin group •Mowed diffuse increases in intracytoplasmic vacuolization 
of hepatocytes. 
14. Plasma Drug Levels 
Blood samples were collected from each animal 30 min befnre and at intervals up to 3 hr after 
dosing on day-; 1, 42 and <'t termination (Table 111.6). Peak fcsphenytoin levels were seen 10-
15 min after administration. Rapid conversion to phenytoin was demonstratec by the 
apJ:.earance of p'1enytoin levels by 5 min after dosing. Phenytoin levels peakAd at 
ap;iroximately 60 min after prodrJg administration. Pe11'-phenytoin levels in the phenytoin 
group were consistently "tbout 3 times lower than those 1n the equimolar fosphenytoin group.

IV. SPECIAL TOXICITY 
A) VENOUS ANO PERIVASCULAR IRRITATION IN RABBITS (RR 745-10724. Vol. 1.20). 
When administered as a 30-min iv infusion (0.05 mVmin) into the right ear or as a 0.1 ml perivascular 
injection into the left ear, fosphenytoin at concentrations of 10, 25, or 50 mg/ml was no more irritating 
than the saline control at either site. A concentration of 75 mg/ml resulted in higher (50%) irritation 
scores than the saline control at both sites. Phenytoin concentrations of 16.9, 33.7, and 50 mg/ml 
produced significantty greater microscopic irritation than did the saline control at the venous site and 
concentrations of 33. 7 and 50 mg/ml produced significantty greater irritation at the perivascular site. 
The three highest doses of phenytoin were only slightty more irritating than their undiluted vehicle 
(40% propylene glycol, 10% alcohol, water-pH adjusted to 12 with NaOH). The irritation produced 
by phenytoin and its vehicle included a high incidence of thrombosis. which was not seen in the 
fosphenytoin groups. 
B) LOCAL IRRITATION AFTER >'CUTE IM INJECTION OF RABBITS (RR 745-01737. Vol. 1.20). 
'V1icroscopic irritation scores (slight to moderate) were not different among injections sites for saline, 
phenytoin vehicle, and phenytoin (50 mg/ml). lnitation scores (minimal to mild) at fosphenytoin vehicle 
(01 M Tris buffer, pH adjusted to 8.8 with HCI) or fosphenytoin (25, 50, 75, or 100 mg/ml) sites were 
statistically lower than those for saline control and phenytoin. 
C) LOCAL IRRITATION AFTER DAILY IM INJECTION OF RABBITS FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS 
(RR 745-01741, Vol. 1.20). 
When a 1 ml volume was injected im i~to the hindlimb of rabbits daily for 5 consecutive days, 
fosphenytoin concentrations of 50, 75 and 100 mg/ml produced concentration-depen<'ent irritation 
compared to saline controls (increased serum crec.!ine kinase and irritation scores). Based on 
macroscopic scores and effects on serum CK, phenytoin at 50 mg/ml was more irritating than 
equ1molar concentrations of fosphenytoin. Irritation produced by the undiluted phenyto1n vehicle was 
comparable in severity to that seen 'Nlth formulated phenytcin at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. 
D) HYPERGLYCEMIC EFFECTS IN RATS (RR 745-C1734, Vol. 1.20) 
Fosphenytoin (150 mg/kg) or phenytoin (100 mg/kg) were administered by 30 min ;nfus1ons 10 10 
rats/group, and multiple blood a111,; unne samples were collected over a 48 hr period. Serum glucose 
concentrations in the fosphenytoi1· and phenytoin groups were elevated by 30 min after dosing and 
peaked at about 400 mg/dL at 1 i"' Levels were significantly increased tor 4.f, hr after dosing 
Glucose levels in both groups had returned to normal by 24 hr. Unne glucose levels increased during 
the first 12 hr after dosing in both groups compared to saline controls and returned to normal during 
the second 12 hr. S:.:ltects on glucose were comparable for the two drugs. 
E) CNS TOXICITY IN MICE (RR 745-01736, vol. 1 20). 
6 mice/group reca1ved single ip injections of equ1molar cioses of fosphenytoin or phenytoin sodium 
solution. Saline and vehicle controls were included. Fosphenytom at 50 mg/kg or phenytom at 33 
mg/kg produced no effects. Dose-related CNS toxicit1. including decreased respiration, prostration, 
p1loerection. tremors, ataxia, sedation. decreased pupil response, ri.duced righting reflex, decreased 
~lflP strength, decreased body temperature, and death (at 2 highest doses). were observed after 
doses of 100, 200, 500, or 1000 mg/kg of fosphenytoin or 69, 134, 337, er 675 of phenytoin. 
Responses to equimolar doses of fosphf 1yto1n and phenytoin wen• similar. but there was a 
suggestion of qu3ntnat1vely greater effects with fosphenytoin. These 1i'ferences may have been due 
to differences m absorption after 1p adm1mstrat1on 
29 •• F) CARDIOVASCULAR TOXIC'ITY IN DOGS (RR 745-01735, Vol. 1.20). 
The cardio\>aSClllar effects of fospheny!Din, phenytoin, and their respective vehicles (0.1 M Tris buffer, 
pH 8.8 and 40% propylene glycvl, 10% alcohol, pH 12) were o:impared following iv bolus (3 sec) 
injection to anesthetized female dogr (4/group). A saline contrOI was also included. The phenytoin 
dosa(le (18 mg/kg) used in the study was considered to represent 9 clinically effective dose for 
treatment of status epilepticus, which would nonnally be infcsed over 20-30 min. The fosphe,1ytoin 
dose (27 mg/kg) was equimolar. Heart rate, left venlrtcular dP/dt at 40 mmHg (l VdP/dt), left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure (L VEDP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and Lead II 
electrocardiograms were recorded at frfl<luent intervals for 1 hour after dosing. Blood samples for 
determination of drug concentrations were collected at each interval. 
Since there were no differences in CV parameters among the three control groups, data from these 
were pooled. Lead II ECG recordings were similar among groups. A slight increase in QT interval was 
seen in both treated groups, but this effect was not considered biologically significant. Intravenous 
phenytt:lin resulted in decreases in ~eart rate (80% of baseline), LvdP/dt (max -55% compared to C), 
and MAP ("40% compared tn C) and a significant increase in LVEDP (2-3-fold). Effects on LVdp/dt 
and L VEDP lasted 3-5 min. 'Wl'lile changes in MAP gradually returned toward baseline over the 60-min 
observation period and HR remained low up to 1 hr (Flgul'lls IV. 1 and IV.2). Pea/\ phenytoin levels 
in blood occurred at ;;o sec after dosing (49 ug/ml) and gradually decreased to 14 ug/kg at 60 min 
(Table IV.1). Fosphenytoin resuiied in more gradual decreases in HR (80% of baseline), LvdP/dt (max 
-36% compared to C), and MAP (-40% compared to C and baseline). These changes peaked at 2-3 
min and then slowly ret;imed toward baseline (HR remained low at 1 hr). Effects on L VEDP were 
Yariable and did not appear to :>e as pronounced as !hose produced by phenytoin administration. 
Phenytoin blood levels rose more slowly after fosphenytoin administration, peaking at 5 min after 
dosing (22 ug/m!). Effects on CV parameters appeared to correlate with phenytoin blood levels in both 
cas11s. The rnajor difference between drugs was in effects on LVEDP. i:1e less pronounced effects 
seen P.iter fosphenytoin presumably reflect !he lower peak blood level of phenytoin resulting from its

IN VITRO EFFECTS ON HUMAN BLOOD (RR 745-01746. Vol. 1.20). 
Washed cell and plasma from blood collected from 4 human donors were mixed with various 
concentrations of fosphenytoin and phenytoin and compared to positive controls IC1r hemolysis and 
plasma protein flocculation by measuring hemoglobin concentration or optical density. Fosphenytoin 
produced little hemolysis (<0.7%) at any of the concer.tratiC1ns tested (0.15 -75 mg/ml). Phenytoin 
produced only slight hemolysis (<3.6%) at concentrations up to 5 mg/kg, but essentially complete 
hemolysis was seen at 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml. Fosphenyloin produced no plasma protein floccul"ltion 
at any concentration tested. Phenytoin produced mild flocculation at 20 mg/ml but none at IO\,er or 
higher concentrations, indicating that this may have been an anomalous result. No explanation for the 
difference 1n hemolytic effects was provided. 
H) POTENTIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC rORMALDEHYDE (RR-MEMO 745-01786, Vol. 
1.31) 
Formaldehyde is generated during the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin by tissue 
phosphatases (t112 approximately 8 min in humans). The theoretical maximum dose of formaldehyde, 
assuming complete, instllntaneous conversion after an iv dose of 2100 mg fosphenytoin (said to be 
maximum human iv dose), and based on a 1:1 molar ratio, would be 155.3 mg (5.17 mmol) or 3.1 
mg/kg (50 kg BW). The theoretical maximal rate of exposure to formaldehyde was calculated as 0.22 
mgll;g/min, based on a fosphenytoin infusion rate of 150 mg/min. (The proposed maximum dose ano 
rate are now 30 mg/kg and 225 mg/min, respectively.) 
The pharmacokinetics of formaldehyde and its major metabolite formate were modeled using data 
from a published report (McMartin et al., Biochem Pharmacol 28:645-649, 1979) in which 
formaldehyde (30 mg/kg) was admir,istered iv to monkeys. Using this model, peak formaldehyde and 
formate concentrations resulting from first order input of 3 mg/kg formaldehyde, with a formation half­
life of 8 mir.. were simulated (Figures IV. 3 and IV.4). Peak formaldehyde levels were predicted to 
be approximately 0.18 mmol/L, with concentrations declining to background levels (0.027-0.068 
mmolll.) within 20 min. Maximal formate levels were predicted to be 0.08 mmol/L, which is below the 
baseline levels measured in 2 monkeys in the same published study (0.1 Band 0.27 mmol/L). These 
are worst case simulations analogous to a bolus dose of 2100 mg of fosphenytoin. Background levels 
of f0rmate in humans have been reported in the literature to be 3 to 19 mg/L (0.07 to 0.4 mM). 
Elevations in formate levels were expected to be transient, since an elimination t112 of about 11 min 
was predicted. Metabolic acidosis ant:t other characteristics of methanol poisoning reported in 2 
monkeys lo.lowing administration of a high dose of methanol (3 g/kg) were associated with plasma 
formate levels of 6.4 and 10.5 mmoVL (McMartin et al., above). Plasma formate levels measured in 
4 healthy volunteers following administration of 1200 mg of fosphenytoin by iv infusion over 30 min 
were not significanUy different from those observed in a placebo group (N=5) or from baseline levels, 
which averaged about 25 mg/L. It is thought that endogenous production of formaldehyde during 
normal metabolism in humans amounts to about 36 g/day in a 50 kg person; thus, the estimated 
maximal amount of formaldehyde added as a result of fosphenytoin administration (3.1 mg/kg) 
represents about 0.5% of the daily bOdy burden due to metabolism 
Since the theoretical maximum dose of formaldehyde represents only a fraction of the total body 
burden from normal r 1etabotism, and since the PK simul;,itions indicated that formaldehy'Je 
concentrabons would exc.."ed background levels for a relatively short time, the sponsor considers the 
potential risks assoctated with formaldahyde exposure as a result of fosphenytom administration to 
be negligibl&.

33 V. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY (Vol. 1.31) 
A) AMES TEST (RR 745-01958) 
Fosphenytoin was tested with Salmonella strains TA-98, TA-100, TA-1535, TA-1637. and TA-1538, 
both with and without metabolic activation. In initial rangefinding tests, no toxicity to the 
background lawn occurred, by either plate incorporation or preincubation methods, over 
concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5000 ug/plate. No increase in revertants occurred for any strain 
in these tests. Confirmatory tests were performed by the plate incorporation method in triplicate 
with concentrati<'n<> ranging from 312.5 to 5000 uglplate. The positive controls produced 
appropriate increases in revertant frequency with each strain. and all background frequencies were 
within historical ranges. No toxicity to the background lawns occurred. Statistically significant 
trends wer!' seen in TA-100, with and without activation, and with TA-98 without activation; 
however. the increases were relatively small and not considered biologically significant. The 
sponsor pointed out that greater (statistically significant) increases in revertant frequency were 
seen with placebo (Tris buffer vehicle) in both of these strains. The maximum response with TA-
100 was 1.4-fold the background level at 5000 uglplate without activation, while the maximum 
increase with TA-98 was 1.7X the background at 625 and 1250 ug/plate without activation.

B) MUTATION ASSAY IN V79 CHINESE HAMSTER LUNG CELLS (RR 745-01935) 
V79 Chinese hamster lung cell cultures were exposed to fosphenytoin for 3 hr in the presence and 
absence of S9. The concentrations ranged from 100 to 4000 ug/ml in both studies. In dose 
r;mge-find1ng for cytotoxicity. the high concentration produced no effect on cell suNival in the 
absence of S9, but in the presence of S9 there was a 89% reduction in cell survival at 4000 ug/ml. 
In the 2 nonact1vated mutation (HGPRT locus) assay trials. the presence of fosphenvtoin did not 
produce an increase i 1 mutant frequency. The positive control (ethyl methanesulfnnate) produced 
appropnate increases in both trials (>4X background). but the magnitude of the response differed 
markedly between trials (68.2 and 836.4 muta~ts/1 o\ All background frequencies were within 
the acceptdble range (0-15 mutants/106). 
In both activation trials, the positive control (benzo{a)pyrene) produced appropriate increases in 
mutant frequency. and background frequencies were within the acceptable range. Cell viability 
was reduced by about 40-50% {relative to vehicle controls) at the maximum fosphenytoin 
concentration in both trials. In trial 1, there was a significant quadratic trend due t9 an increase 
in mutation frequency at two intermediate drug concentrations (23 and 24 mutants/10° at 1000 and 
2000 ug/ml, respectively, versus 11 mutants/106 in vllhicle controls) Although not significant by 
linear dose trend analysis. the effect met other criteria for a positive assay, ie. mutant frequency 
at least 2X vehicle control at two or more contiguous drug concentrations and exceeding 20 
mutants per 106 viable cells with 1t least one concentration. In trial 2, however, no effect on 
mutation frequency was seen in fosphenytoin exposed cultures. 
Drug lot: CM 344120 
C) CHROMOSOME ABERRATION IN V79 CHINESE HAMSTER LUNG CELLS {RR 745-02101) 
Fosphenytoin, at concentrations up to 4000 ug/ml (high concentration arbitrarily chosen in the 
absence or cytotoxicity or insolubility), was tested for its ability to induce structural chromosome 
aberrations (SCA) in cultured V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. 
34 
• In assays performecf"wlthout S9 activation, with fosphenytoin concentrations from 500 to 4000 
ug/ml, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells with aberrations at 
the 12 hr harvest time after expostJre to 4000 ug/ml (8.5% vs 2.5% in vehicle control; 14 and 15% 
after 1 and 1.25 ug/ml mitomycin C). Because this finding did not satisfy the pre-established 
criteria of statistically significant increases at 2 consecutive concentrations, with at least one 
response exceeding the historical control range (0-5% with S9, 0-6.3% without S9), it was not 
considered to be biologically significant. 
Fosphenytoin was tested in the presence of S9 in J separate trials. In the first trial, the positive 
control (C'fclophosphamide) did not significantly increase SCA at either concentration, so the trial 
was considered invalid (data not submitted). In the second trial (Table V.1), with concentrations 
ranging from 1000-4000 ug/ml, the percentage of cells with aberrations and the mean number of 
aberrations per cell were both significantly increased at all concentrations and at both harvest 
times (18 & 24 hr). In many cases, these values were higher than those in the positive control 
groups, which were also significantly increased. In a third trial (Table V.2), with lower 
concentrations of fosphenytoin (125-2000 u9/ml), no significant increase in chromosomal 
aberrations was observed at any dose or harvest time. However, the positive control significantly 
increased SCA only at the highest concentration and only al 1 of the 2 harvest limes ( 18 hr) in this 
trial (met sponsors minimum criteria for valid assay). 
The sponsor postulated that the clastogenic effect was due to the generation of formaldehyde in 
vitro. Phenytoin was reportedly not clastogenic in previous studies with CHO cells (literature 
references), while formaldehyde has been reported to induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro in 
CHO cells at concentrations as low as 5 ug/ml (literature reference). However, attempts to 
measure formaldehyde in cultures in the present ~l,;..iy were unsuccessful. Addition of 
formaldehyde dehydrogenase to the S9 would have been an alternate a~proach. The degradation 
proouct diphenylhydantoic acid, which was said to be present at 1.5 to 2% of total drug in these 
studies (prior to metabolic activation), was considered unlikely to be involved, but this possibility 
was not investigated. 
Drug lot: CM 344120 
D) MOUSE MICRONUCLEUS (RR 745-01898) 
Micronucleus formation in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) was determiner! in 
groups of male and female mice (5/sex/group/lime) after administration of single iv doses of 
fosphenytoin (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) The doses were chosen on the basis of a previous acute 
1v infusion study showing 50 mg/kg to be a no-effect dose and 234 mg/kg to be the combined sex 
LOSO. In the present study, clinical signs were seen at the MD and HD, but no deaths occurred. 
Significant decreases in PCE/total erythrOC'fte ratios were seen in HO groups, indicating bone 
marrow toxicity. Small, but statistically significant (by trend but not pair-wise analysis) increases 
1n m1cronucleated PCEs (MNPCEs) were observed at 24 and 48 hr sacrifice times in HD animals 
when sexes were combined. The elevation in MNPCE frequency was less than twice the placebo 
control rate and was within the historical control range. No significant differences were detected 
in the analysis of individual sex MNPCE data. The positive .:ontrol (cyclophospharnide) produced 
a significant increase (about 12x; in mean MNPCE values at 12 hr compared to vehicle (saline) and 
placebo (Tris buffer) controls.

A) SEGMENT I STUDY IN MALE RATS (RR 745-02042, Vol. 1.21) 
1 . Treatment 
Male rats (40/grp) were dosed ·Nitti 0, 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, im, for 75 days prior to mating 
and throughout mating with untreated females (1:1 cohabitation, 10 day maximum), then 
sacrificed. An additional group remained untreated. Females were either sacrificed on Day 
21 of gestation(~) or allowed to deliver and wean their offspring. 
Strain: Sprague Dawley (Crl:CD BR VAF/Plus) 
Drug !or#: CM 344120 
a) Treatment-related clinical signs included injection site sl<in lesions and salivation 
in MD and HD males, and chromodacryorrhea, corneal opacity, ataxia, 
hypoactivity, and prostration in HD males. Convulsions were seen in 1 HD animal 
on the first day of treatment. Mechanical injuries, 1e, damaged incisors, damage 
or swollen nose, palatine lesion, occurred only in HD rats, and were thus 
considered indirectly T-R. 
b) Two HD animals died during treatment, on Days 11 and 12. In addition, 2 HD 
males were sacrificed after sustaining mechanical injuries. 
c) T-R decreases in BW (10 and 30% in MD and HD, respectively), BW gain (26 and 
92% in MD and HD, r&spectively), and food consumption were observed in MD 
and HD groups during the premating period. 
d) Mean plasma phenytoin concentrations on Day 0 were 4. 7, 18.5, and 37.3 ug/ml 
in LO, MD, and HD males. respectively. On Day 73, levels were 6.6, 20.9, and 
44.9 ug/ml in the same respoctive groups. 
f) All groups had lower than expected fertility indices, but there were no apparent 
relationship to treatment. 
g) Histopathologic evaluation of the right testis on Day 91 revealed no drug-induced 
testicular changes. There were no significant group differences in testicular or 
accessory organ weights, epididymal sperm count or sperrnatid head count, 
p;;: cent motill! sperm, or percent normal sperm morphology. Hemorrhage at the 
injection sne was increased in all treatment groups relative to controls. 
3. Term Sacrifice Parameters 
a) A small increase in pre1mplantat1on loss was seen 1n HD group litters. The mean 
value (12.5%) was within the historical control range, however. 
b) The incidence of stu11ted fetuses was increased in HD group litters. There were 
7 fetuses (6 male) weighing <4 g in 4 HD litters vs 1 stunted fetus in both 
controls. The HD incidence of stunted fetuses was saic · to be within the historical 
control range, and group mean BWs were not different. In addition, 4 of tile HD 
stunted fetuses were in 1 litter with B resorptions. 
c) A statistically significant difference in fetal sex ratio occurred at the MD and HD 
compared to VC, and was outside the historical control range. Howe .er, the VC 
ratio was outside the range in the other direction. The ratio of males to females 
was 47:53, 56:44, 5348, 43:57, and 44:56 for UC, VC. LO, MD, and HD groups, 
respectively. There were no other group differences in fetal developmental 
parameters. 
37 4. Deliverv and Offspring Developmental Parameters 
a) There were no treatment-related effects on reproductive parameters in dams 
allowed to deliver (gestation length, uterine implants on Day 21 of lactation, viable 
pups). There were no group differences in offspring sex ratios at birth. 
b) Offspring BWs during the lactation period were comparable among groups. 
Maturation (PN Weeks 3-13) aw was slightly decreased in HO group male 
offspring. 
c) There were no other group diffen!nces in various measures of offspring 
development, including acquisition of developmental landmar!<s, rotorod 
performance, locomotor activity, emotionality, acoustic startle response, and 
shuttle box avoidance behavior. 
B) SEGMENT I STUDY IN FEMALE RATS (RR 745-02092, Vol. 1.23) 
1. Treatment 
Female rats (40/grp) were dosed with O (vehicle), 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, im, for 15 days 
pnor to mating With untreated males. and throughout mating, gestation and lactation. Half 
of females underwent C-section on Day 21 of gestation, while the remainder were allowed 
to deliver and wean their offspring. 
Strain: Sprague-Dawley (Crt:CO BR VAF/Plus) 
Drug lot#: CM 344120 
a) T-R clinical signs included hypoactivity, ataxia, prostration. r.alivat1on, chewing, 
alopecia. swelling of paw or nose. chromodacryorrhea. hypothermia, dyspnea, and 
eye changes, seen primarily in MO and HD animals. All HD animals exhibited 
signs of neurotoxicity. 
b) Two HO females died and 3 were sacrificed moribund during the premating 
treatment pe1iod. One MO female was sacrificed moribund on Day 23 of gestation 
with treatment related dystocia. 
c) BW and BW gain during the premating period were decreased in MD and HD 
females. Statistically significant weigh! loss of 15.5 g occurred in the HD rats 
cornpared to a mean gain of 12.6 g in VC. Most of the weight loss in both MD and 
HD animals occurred during the first 6 days of treatment. During the gestation 
period, BW garn was significantly decreased by 7 and 45% in the MD and HD 
groups, respectively. During lactation. weight gain in the HD females was 48% 
greater than in VC animals (NS). 
d) Plasr'la phenytorn concentrations on Day 7 of gest:;ition are shown in Table Vl.1. 
e) There was a 0-R increase in the number ct females with prolonged diestrus in the 
MD and HO groups, and an increase in the number of females with prolonged 
estrus (>2 consecutive days) at the HO. Five HO females were in constant 
diestrus during the treatment period and 13 were in diestrus on 15 of 16 days of 
treatment. All HD females had a~normal estrous cycles consisting of prolonged 
estrus, prolonged d1estrus, or an estrous cycle length of 7 days. There was also 
a 0-R decrease rn the number of .... +rous cycles completed in MO and HD groups. 
t) There were no effects of treatment on mating or fertility indices. but number of 
davs to mating was increased istatistically significant) in the HO group (Table 
VI.<!) 
38 g) •• There was an increase 1n gross pathology findi:igs of small thymus. injection site 
lesions, alopecia, and ocular abnormalities {chromodacryorrhea, enlargement.

b) The overall malformation incidence and 1nc1dences of extemal/visccral 
malformations, external/visceral variations. and skeietal variations were increased 
in HD fetuses (Tables Vl.4a and Vl.4b). The percent of fetuses per litter and 
perce:it of litters with external/visceral malformations was 5-1 O times those ol 
concurrent and historical controls. These rnalformations included brain (missing 
occipital lobe and missing portion of temporal lobe. h1stolog1cally decreased 
c:erebral cortex size). cardiovascular, limb (ectrodactyly). and rcprod1.0ctive tract 
(hermaphrodite) defects. One LO fetus also had a brain malformati:>n 
(microcephaly with dilated fourth ventricle and missing telencephalon). The effect 
on external/visceral variations was due to an increase in stunted fetuses; 100% 
of HO fetuses were stunted (BW <4.0 g). The number of stunted fetuses was also 
increased at the MD. Increased incidences rudimentary ribs and of hypoptastic 
and unoss1f1ed bones in the skull, pelvis, and vertebral column were seen in HD 
39 litter$. In addition, misshapen. bifid, and dumbbell-shaped centra occurroo more 
frequently in the MD and HD groups. Significantly decreased ossification was 
seen in MD and HD fetuses. 
4. Delivery Data 
a) Parturition was significantly delayed in the HD group. Five HD females delivered 
live litters on Day 24 of gestation and a sixth delivered 1 cann1.>alized pup on Day 
24. Three HD and 1 VC females were sacrificed after failing to deliver by Day 24, 
and live pups w11re found in utero. One additional HO dam sacrificed on Day 24 
had total litter resorption. One MD dam was sacrificed moribund during parturition, 
and 1 LO dam had retained placenta and fetuses at necropsy on Day 4 of 
lactation. 
b) Implants, litter size, and number of live pups were significantly decreased and 
postimplantation loss significantly increased at the HD (Table Vl.5). 
c) Pup birth weights were decreased in HD litters. Postnatal BW gain through week 
4 was decreased in MO and HD offspring. 
d) Postnatal survival was decreased in HD offspring, especially in the neonatal 
period (survival 63% vs 96% in controls). 
e) Clinical observations of chromodacryorrhea (9 pups in 5 litters) and circling (1 
pup) were made only in HD offspring. Eye opening was significantly delayed in HD 
offspring. There were no group differences in external or visceral malformations 
among F 1 neonates,

C) INTRAVENOUS TERATOLOGY STUDY OF FOSPHENYTOIN IN RATS (RR 745-01973, Vols. 
1.25-26). 
1. Treatment 
Pregnant rats (40/group) were treated with 0 (vehicle), 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg, iv, on 
gestation Days 7 through 17. An untreated control group (N=40) was evaluated 
concurrently. C-sections were performed on 25/group on Day 21; the remaining 15/group 
were allowed to deliver and rear offspring. At weaning, 1/sex//litter were retained for 
behavioral evaluation, and 1/sex/litter were retainP.d for evaluation of reproductive 
pertormance. 
Strain: Sprague Dawley (Crt:CD BR VAF/Plus) 
Drug lot#: CM 344120 
2. FD Effects: 
a) T-R dinical signs, including salivation, chewing motions, hypoactivity, ataxia, and 
limb rigidity, were noted in HD dams. Salivation was also seen in MD dams. 
b) Four HD dams died during treatment (2 dosing accidents, 2 possibly T-R) and 
another was euthanized due to broken limbs. 
c) Gestational BW gain was decreased during (38%) anc; following (18%) treatment 
in the i-ID group. 
3. Maternal plasma levels 
Mean plasma phenytoin concentrations measured 1 hr postdose (ie, not peak) on 
gestation Day 17 increased approximately dose-proportionally (Table Vl.6). One sample 
fror;: a vehicle control had measurable phenytoin levels !or unknown reasons.

4. C-Section Data 
Term fetuses were examineJ for external and palatine abnormalities. All fetuses were then 
examined by fresh dissection for visceral abnormalities, and skeletal examinations were 
perfor"led on 2/3 of the fetuses from each litter. The heads of the other 1/3 were fixed 
and examined for abnormalities. 
a) Postimplantation loss was increased about 2-fold in HD dams compared to 
concurrent and historical controls. 
b) Mean fetal BW was decreased (30% below VC) in the HD group. 
c) Increased incidences of skeletal malformations (slight; pnmarily hemicentra). 
external/visceral variations, and skeletal variations were seen in HD litters {Table 
Vl.7). The increase in variations was due to a marked increase in growth retarded 
fetuses in HD litters; 60% of HD fetuses were stunted (BW <4 g) 
5. Deliverv Data 
a) The duration of gestation was significantly increased in the HD group. 
b) Postimplantation loss was slightly increased at the MD and HD {Table Vl.8). 
c) Birth weights were significantly decreased {1'l%) in HD males and females. 
Weight gain was comparable among groups during lactation, but weight gain from 
week 3 through 13 and mean weights at week 13 were decreased in all treated 
male offspring (5, 6, and 15% less than VC, all statistically significant) and in HD 
female offspring (7%, NS). 
d) Vaginal opening was delayed in MD ana HD female pups. 
e) Two littermates in the HD group exhibited abnormal circling behavior, and 27 pups 
f~om 8 HD litters and 1 MD pup had chromodacryorrhea. Both have previously 
been associated with prenatal phenytoin exposure. One of the HD circlers later 
died (P 23). 
t) Locomotor activity was increased in HD males on P 42; however, this was due to 
the increased activity of a single HD pup. No group differences were found in 
acoustic startle parameters on P 43 or in shuttle avoidance parameters during 
week 9. 
g) Reproductive parameters were comparable among F1 groups.

Pregnant rabbits (20/group) were treated with 0 (vehicle}, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, iv, on 
gestation Days 6 through 18. An untreated control group (N=20) was evaluated 
concurrently. C-sections were performed on Day 30 of gestation. 
Strain: New Zealand White 
Drug lot#: CM 345120 
2. FO Effects: 
a) Chewing signs during or after dosing Wf'rP observed in MD and HD animals. 
Additional signs that occurred daily during treatment in 1 or 2 HO does included 
ataxia, limb rigidity, and shallow rapid breathing. 
b) None of the treated or control animals died during the study. 
c) 0-R suppression of food consumption and BW gain was evident during the 
treatment period in MD and HO does (statistically significant at HD). BW gain was 
significantly increased in HO does during the postdosing period. 
d) Mean plasma phenytoin concentrations measured 1 hr postdose on gestation day 
18 increased approximately dose-proportionally (Table Vl.9). HD levels were 1.5-
3.5 times the generally accepted range of therapeutic concentrations (10-20

a) None of the animals aborted, delivered early, or had total resorption. 
b) The numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live, dead, and ;esorbed fetuses 
were comparable across groups. Pre-and postimplantation loss were not affected 
by treatment. 
c) Fetal weights were slightly decreased at the HD. 
4. Fetal Evaluation

46 •• E) PERINATAL-POSTNATAL STUDY IN RATS (RR 745-02071, Vol. 1.28). 
1. Treatment 
Female rats (251group) were treated with 0 (vehicle), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, iv, from Day 
15 of pregnancy through Day 20 postpartum. An untreated control group was also 
included. The dams were allowed to deliver and rear offspring. F1 offspring were 
evaluated for survival, clinical appearance, growth, behavior, and reproductive 
performance. 
Strain: Sprague Dawley (Crl:CD BR VAF/Plus) 
Drug lot #: CM 345120 
2. FO Effects: 
a) Clinical signs observed with increased frequency in treated females (primarily at 
HD) included excessive chewing motion, salivation, hypoactivity, citaxia, and 
prostration 
b) One MD and 9 HD dams die•1 or were sacrificed moribund during dosing, all 
apparently as a result of treatment. One VC dam died of unknown causes. 
c) Maternal BW gain during the gestational treatment period was significantly 
decreased (-1g%) by the HD. Weight gain during the first 2 weeks of lactation was 
also suppressed at the HD (-20-30%), but overall lactational weight gain was 
comparable among groups. Food consumption was decreased during the entire 
treatment periOd in HD dams. 
d) Mean plasma phenytoin concentration determined 1 hr after dosing on the last 
day of treatment (PND 20) were 6.67, 12.7, and 29.2 ug/ml in LO, MD, and HD 
groups, respectively. 
3. Parturition (Table Vl.10) 
a) One MD and 5 HD dams died around the time of parturition (GD 22-23). All were 
found to have fetuses in utero. and all dead HD dams had resorptions. 
b) ·A statistjcally significant increase in the duration of gestation was seen in the MD 
and HD 11roups compared to vehicle controls. 
c) The number of stillborn pups or pups that died on pos•natal Day O and the percent 
postim;ilantation loss were increased in all treatment groups relative to VC; the 
increase in stillbirth was statistically significant at the HD. At the LD, this finding 
was due to 1 litter with 17 dead pups.

4 F 1 Neonatal and Weanling P;;;rameters 
a) Survival at birth was decreased in all treatment groups, and was statistically 
significant at the HD. Subsequent survival was not affected by treatment. 
b) Offspring BW at birth and postnatal weight gain through weaning were decreased 
( 10% compa1 ed to VC; statistically significant) in HD males and temales. This 
effect on pup BW at the HD persisted into the maturation period (below). 
c) Several developmental landmari<s (pinnae detachment, lower incisor eruption. and 
testes descent) appeared significantly earlier in treatment groups than in controls. 
This can be attribu1ed to their increased time of in utero development. There were 
no group differences for eye opening and vaginal opening. All pups responded 
positively to the visual placement test on PND 21. 
d) In external and visceral examinations perform!!d on stillborn, dead, and pups 
sacrificed at weaning, malformation were found in 1 untreated control pup (patent 
ductus arteriosus) and 2 HO pups (unilateral forepaw brachydactyly; 
microphthalmia, microstomia, short tail, and malformed nose). 
e) Structural variations of the ureter and kidney were increased 1n MD and HD litters 
compared to C. Al the MD, almost all observations came frc n 1 litter. In the HD 
group, findings were primarily from 2 litters. All kidney/ureter variations were 
observed in pups from dams thal died dunng late gestation.

in LO and MD males and by 41% in HD males and was elevated by 21%, 27%, 
and 32% during minute 3 in the LO, MD, and HD groups, respectively; average 
speed was elevated 14-20% at the HD for minutes 2-4, relative to VC; vertical 
movements during minute 3 were increased 29, 19, and 40% in LO, MD, and HD 
males, respectively; vertical time was increased 33 and 70% during minute 2 in 
MD and HD males. respectively, and during minute 3 was elevated 41, 39, and 
52% in LO, MD, and HD males, respectively; and the amount of time spent i~ the 
center of the open field was 38% less in HD males. Increased activity has been 
reported previously in rats prenatally exposed t;i phenytoin. 
c) Results of acoustic startle testing on PND 43 indicated no T-R differences in 
startle response. 
d) Increases (NS) in shuttle box avoidance responding, recall testing, and number 
of crossing were observed in MD and HD males relative to VC during postnatal 
Week 9, presumably secondary to hyperactivity.

VII. SUMMARY 
PHARMACOOYNAMICS 
In the initial pharmacological evaluation by NINOS, fosphenytoin showed good anticonvulsant activity in the 
MES test but, as exoectect, was not active in the scMET lest Activity against MES-induced seizures was 
equivalent lo that of phenytoin after ip and oral administration (Table 1.1 ). Fosphenytoin displayed slightly 
greater toxicity (Rotorod TOSO) after ip administratior:, possil>ly due lo more rapid absorption. The 
anticonvulsant potency of fosphenytoin against MES-induced seizures in mice was not significantly different 
than that of phenytoin either 10 or 30 minutes after iv dosing, and the lime courses of anticonvulsant action 
were comparable tor the two drugs (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). 
The ability of fosphenytoin to reverse cardiac glycoside-induced arrhythmias in intact dogs was similar lo that 
of phenytoin when the two drugs were administered intravenously, although phenytoin restored normal rhythm 
marginally faster. In an in vitro preparation, it was determined that the prodrug had no inherent antiarrhythmic 
effect. 
In a study comparing the hemodynamic effects of iv infusion of equimolar amounts of fosphenytoin or 
phenytoin to anesthetized dogs, both drugs produced markl!d reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, and 
left ventricular contractility. When equimolar doses of the two drugs were rapidly infused (40 mg/kg PE over 
2 min), changes in CV parameters were similar but some·Nhat more pronounced after fosphenytoin than after 
phenytoin. The onset of action was slightly delayed by fosphenytoin administration, and CV effects appeared 
to correlate with plasma phenytoin levels (Figures 1.1-3). When lower equimolar doses (21 mg/kg PE) of 
fosphenytoin or phenytoin were infused over 15-30 min, the maximum effects (reductions in diastolic BP and 
contractility) were comparable and were observed at similar plasma levels of phenytoin (Figures 1.4-6). The 
maximum effects of fosphenytoin appeared to be primarily determined by the total dose rather than the rate 
of administration. At times When plasma levels of both fosphenytoin and phenytoin (formed from fosphenytoin) 
were high, effects were not greater than those seen at comparable levels of phenytoin alone: therefore, ii did 
not aopear that fosphenytoin had any significant hemodynamic effects of its own in vivo under the conditions 
of this study. However, under in vitro conditions in Which less than 1 % of phenytoin was present. fosphenytoin 
(EC50=43 ug/ml) had a cardiac depressant effect similar to that of r~enytoin (EC50=27 ug/ml) in guinea pig 
left atrial preparations (Figure 1.7). No such intrinsic activity of fosphenytoin was seen in guinea pig right atria. 
Fosphenytoin was shown lo reduce brain damage in several models of ischemic stroke, but did not protect 
against NMOA-induced brain damage. 
Absorption and Pharmacokinetics 
Single-dose studies were performed in rats and dogs to compare fosphenytoin and phenytoin 
pharmacokinetics following im and iv administration Peak blood levels of phenytoin were greater (5-fold) 
following im administration of fosphenytoin 1115-500 mg/kg) to rats than after im administration of phenytoin 
(equimolar). indicating that prodrug administration significantly enhanced phenytoin bioavailability. 
After an iv dose of 14.8 mg/kg of fospherytoin (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of phenytoin) to dogs, fosphenytoin 
t1/2, Vd, and AUC values averaged 2.6 min, 150 ml/kg, and 255 ug·min/ml, respectively. The Cl of 40.2 
ml/min/kg approximated hepatic blood flow, which would be \:onsistent with metabolism to phenytoin by 
phosphatases in kidney and liver. Fosphenytoin was not detectP.J in blood at 30 min postdose. Peak phenytoin 
levels (mean 6.98 ug/ml) were reached at 3.3 min, with the formation t1/2 averaging 0.42 min. During the first 
30 min after administration of phenytoin, phenytoin levels were higher than after administration of 
fosphenytoin, but thereafter, levels were similar. The elimination t1/2, Cl, Vd, and AUC of phenytoin were not 
significantly different after iV administration of fosphenytoin or phenytoin sodium (Table 11.1 ). The bioavailability 
of phenytoin after iv fosphenytoin administration averaged 97%. The metabolic elimination pattern was not 
50 ... 
different after iv prodrug, with the m-HPPH glucuronide constituting the major urinary metabolite and 
accounting for approximately the same % of the dose (55%) after administration of either drug. 
After im administration of fosphenytoin (14.8 mg/kg), fosphenytoin levels reached a mean peak of 20.4 ug/ml 
at 10 min (Table 11.3), then rapidly decreased such that fosphenytoin was not detectable in plasma after 120 
min. Tt.e absorption and elimination t112 values averaged 3.2 and 17.4 min, respectively. The appearance of 
phenytoin in the plasma was fairiy rapid after im administration of fosphenytoin. The formation t112, Cmax, and 
tmax for were 24.7 min, 6.8 ugtml, and 76.9 min, respectively (Table 11.2). The corresponding values after im 
administration of an equimolar dose of phenytoin were 17.4 min, 2.16 ug/ml, and 68.1 min for the absorption 
t1/2, Cmax, and tmax, respectively. The elimination t112 and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin after 
fosphenytoin administration averaged 164 min and 1058 mUkg, respectively, which were significantly different 
than corresponding values of 369 min and 4086 mUkg, respectively, obtained after im phenytoin. These 
resul!s are consistent with precipitation of phenytoin at the injection site, with slow release inlo the circulation. 
The AUC values obtained after administration of phenytoin were substantially lower than phenytoin AUCs after 
fosphenytoin, indicating that the bioavailability of phenytoin administered as fosphenytoin was increased 
compared to phenytoin sodium after im administration. Fosphenytoin was completely absorbed after im 
administration of a dose of 14.8 mg/kg (10 mg/kg PE) to dogs (Table 11.3). 
The exposure to phenytoin following im administration of fosphenytoin (14.8 mg/kg) to dogs was essentially 
the same as that after iv administration of the prodrug (Table 11.4). Although the rate of conversion to 
phenytoin was slower after im than iv fosphenytoin, and time to peak plasma phenytoin level was longer, other 
phenytoin parameters (Cmax. elimination 1112, Vd, Cl, and AUC) were equivalent. 
Protein Binding 
In vitro binding of [14C)-fosphenytoin to dog and human plasma proteins was assessed by uttrafiltration. 
Binding of 20 ug/ml to dog and human plasma proteins averaged 91.3% and 95. 7%, respectively. Albumin 
accounted for 88% of the fosphenytoin binding to human plasma proteins. Phenytoin binding decreased with 
increasing fosphenytoin concentrations. At a DPH concentration of 5 ug/ml, the free fraction of phenytoin 
increased from 4 to 18% when the fosphenytoin concentrations increased from 7.5 to 500 uglml. These results 
indicate that at high concentrations, fosphenytoin may enhance the pharmacological or toxicological effects 
of phenytoin by displacing DPH from its binding sites. 
Drugs highly bound to albumin, such as phenylbutazone, sulfisoxazole, or wartarin, can displace fosphenytoin 
from binding sites on albumin. When toxic concentrations of AEDs such as PHB, DPH, or VPA were added 
to plasma, the drugs significantiy increased (5-20%) the free fraction of fosphenytoin. DiazeJJ.:-m, phenytoin, 
and carbamazepine at a concentration of <10 ug/ml did not change the free fraction of fosphenytoin. Since 
fosphenytoin has little intrinsic pharmacological effect, the changes in free fraction should have no clinical 
significance. Addition of fosphenytoin at equimolar concentrations to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or VPA 
resulted in small but significant displacement of these drugs from its plasma binding sites. The degree of 
displacement of diazepam or carbamazepine was not enhanced by increasing the concentration of 
fosphenytoin 30-80-fold. The slight increase in free fraction of these drugs caused by fosphenytoin is unlikely 
to have clinical significance. 
In Vitro Hydrolysis 
The in vitro hydrolysis of fosphenytoin to phenytoin was examined in tissues and whole blood :rom rats and 
dogs and in human whole blood. Rat whole blood and tissue hydrolyzed fosphenytoin rapidly, with kidneys, 
small intestine. and liver exhil'iting the highest phosphatase activity. Dog and human whole blood hydrolyzed 
the drug much more slowty. Mean in vitro half-lives of fosphenytoin in rat, dog, and human whole blood were 
5.89. 321. and 189 minutes, respectively. Faster prodrug conversion was observed in dog tissue 
homogenates, with the small i.,t,.stine. kidney, and liver again the most active in mediating hydrolysis of the 
prodrug. Studies with partially purifi~'CI enzymes revealed that fc-sphenytoin was a better substrate for alkalir.e 
phosphatase than for acid phnspr.atase. Despite the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity in plasma, in 
51 ~. 
vitro hydrolysis of fosphenytoin was slow in dog and human blood compared to in vivo conversion. There was 
no explanation for the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo fosphenytom conversion times. 
JM Injection Site Accumulation 
Potential accumulation of phenytoin in dog hindlimb muscles was assessed follOWing single-and multiple-dose 
(BID) im administration of 14C-tosphenytoin (10 mg/kg) and 3H-phenytoin {10 mg/kg). At 8 hr following 
simultaneous single-dose administration, phenytoin concentrations at the injection site were 150-fold greater 
in the hindlimb injected with phenytoin compared to the limb injected with fosphenytoin. The difference 
increased to 2500-fold following repeated administration, indicating increased accumulation of precipitated 
phenytoin at the injection site. Although im phenytoin consistently resulted in edematous swelling at the 
injection site, im fosphenytoin did not precipitate or cause tissue damage following single or multiple-dose 
administration. 
Distributi?n, Metabolism, and Elimination 
Following iv bolus admi.iistration of 14C-fosphenytoin (10 mg/kg; label on hydantoin ring), both tissue 
distribution and elimination were rapid. Highest levels of radioaetivity in blood, heart, kidneys, liver. lung, and 
spleen were measured within 5 min postdose. Highest brain levels {0.2% of dose) occurred at 10-60 min 
Three radioactive peaks were identified as p-HPPH glucuronide, p-HPPH, and phenytoin. Elimination t112's 
for phenytnin ranged from 50-90 min in blood and various tissues. At 48 hr postdose, >98% of the 
administered radioactivity was eliminated, demonstrating that fosphenytoin and/or its metabolites were not 
retained. 
After administration of 14C-fosphenytoin to rats, recovery of radioaetivity from urine and feces over 72 hr 
averaged 52 and 48%, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary and fecal recovery was 99%. p-HPPH 
glucuronide accounted for >40% of dose recovered from urine and feces over the 0-to 24-hr collection 
interval. 
Urine and feces (rat only) were collected for metabolite profiling following administration of 14C-fosphenytoin 
to rats and unlabelt'j fosphenytoin and phenytoin to dogs. Phenytoin, p-HPPH, and p-HPPH 9lucuronide were 
urinary metabolites common to both species. p-HPPH glucuronide (33.9%) was the major metabolite in rat 
urine, whereas m-HPPH glucuronide (51-58%) was the major metabolite in dog urine. Rodent fecal samples 
contained only p-HPPH (21.6%), p-HPPH glucuronide (8.3%), and an unidentified metabolite (10.2%). The 
metabolism and excretion profiles of fosphenytoin and phenytoin were the same following iv administration 
to dogs. 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicok1netic studies in rats showed that the rate of phenytoin appearance in plasma was decreased following 
1m administration relative to N adm1nistrabon of a single 150 mg/kg dose of fospheny\oin (trnax values 10-15X 
greater). peak phenytoin levels were reduced (50-00%) after im administration, there was a sex differences 
1n phenytom clearance (elimination t11'2 4-7.5-fold longer in females), and total pheny\oin exposure (AUC) was 
s1m1lar within sex following 1m or N administration of the same dose (Table 11.5). Fosphenytoin levels were not 
determined. 
Phenytoin kinetics determined after single im or iv doses of 50 mg/kg fosphenytoin to dogs (Table 11.6) were 
fairly r.omparable. Although tmax values following im tosphenytoin were longer than those following iv 
fos!lhenyto1n ( 1.2 hr for 1m versus 0.6 hr for iv), Cmax values (21.3 ug/ml for im versus 26.8 for iv) and plasma 
phen 1oin concentration-time profiles (im and iv AUC values of 159 and 163 ug hr/ml, respectively) were 
s1m1lar ;..,, both routes. Mean elimination t1/2 values were essentially the same following im (2.8 hr) and iv (3 
hr) adm:-11~tration. There was no sex difference in pharmacokinetics in dogs. Fosphenytoin levels were not 
determined 
52 Thus, rate of phenyto1n apr-ear.ltlO! in plasma was decreased folloWing im fosphenytoin administration relative 
to iv administration, but •otal phenytoin exposures as determined by AUC data were similar in rats and dogs 
folloWing im and iv fosphenytoin. Relative fosphenytoin exposures were not determined. 
TOXICOLOGY 
Acute toxicity 
Acute iv toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs (Table 111.1 ). The median lethal doses 
of fosphenytoin and phenytoin in mice and rats were essentially equivalent when both drugs were 
administered by iv infusion, With values ranging from approximately 150-350 mg/kg. Phenytoin was more 
potent than fosphenytoin when the drugs were administered as an iv bolus, probably due to a more gradual 
rise in peak phenytoin levels With the prodrug. Similar CNS-related signs were observed after iv injection of 
fosphenytoin or phenytoin in both rodents and non-rodents and included ataxia, hypoactivity, prostration, and 
convulsions. In addition, salivation and vomiting were seen in dogs, and tremors and dyspnea occurred in 
rodents. The MLD's of iv fosphenytoin and phenytoin in weanling rats were the same as in adults; however, 
neonatal rats were more sensitive to the toxic effects of both drugs than weanling rats folloWing ip 
administra'lion. After im administration, fosphenytoin induced clinical signs. convulsions, and/or deaths in rats 
and dogs al lower doses than phenytoin due to increased absorption and higher blood concentrations 
achieved by this route (Table 111.2). Gross pathologic changes were not observed in acute studies with 
fosphenytoin, while tissue necrosis at im injection sites in rats and dogs was observed with phenytoin. 
Multidose toxiciiy 
A 4-week rat study ( 1 Olsex/group main study, 5/sexlgroup recovery, 3/sexlgroup PK) was conduced with iv 
(bolus) doses of O (vehicle), 30, 60, and 150 mg/kg of fosphenytoin. T-R clinical signs were seen primarily in 
MD and HD animals and consisted of ataxia, hypoactivity, salivation, and dyspnea. BW gain during the dosing 
penoct was decreased (32%) in HD males compared to conrrols. Erythrocyte parameters (RSC, HGB, HCT) 
were slightly decreased and MCHC was increased in HD females compared to controls ALT and ALP were 
increased by about 50% in HD males and females at week 4. Liver weights were increased in females at 
all doses, and periportal vacuolization was observed microscopically in HD males and females. Liver changes 
were not seen following a 4 week recovery period. The increased liver weights and enzyme activities 
presumably reflected the induction of hepatic microsomal drug metaboliZing enzymes, which is a well 
recogniZed effect of phenytoin in animals and humans. The increased periportal vacuolization in HD rats was 
shown by EM to be mainly due to the presence of larger areas of glycogen deposition than in controls. 
Reversible injection site irritation was seen at all doses (D-RJ. Plasma phenytoin levels 15 min after dosing 
dunng week 2 were proportional to dose 1nd similar in males and females; mean concentrations ranged from 
9.1 at the LO to 52.8 uglml in the HD group (Table 111.3). 
A 13 week rat study (10/Sf'lC/group main study, 5/sexlgroup PK) was conducted with im doses of 0 (saline), 
30, 60, or 150 mg/kg of fosphenytoin. A group receiving phenytoin (100 mg/kg, equimolar to HO) served as 
a positive control (PC). Hypoactivity, ataxia, and salivation were observed in both the HD and PC groups. In 
addition, autocanibalism of the hindlimbs was seen in phenytoin-trealed rats. T-R deaths occurred only in the 
HO (2115 M, 1115 F) and PC groups (8115 M, 10/15 F). There were no hematologic effects related to 
fosphenytom treatment. AST, ALT, and ALP levels were elevated in HD males and females, while only slight 
increases in ALP were seen m the PC group. Increased plasma glucose levels (2 hr after dosing) and 
glucosuna were observed in the HD and PC groups. Liver weights were increased in the MD (females) and 
HD groups, and thymus weights were decreased in HD animals. Injection site lesions were observed in 
fosphenyto1~- and phenytom-trealed an:mals (D-R in fosphenytoin groups). lntracytoplasmic hepatocyte 
vacuolization was seen in the HD group (8/10 M, 9/10 F) and single cell hepalocyte necrosis was observed 
m PC animals (3/10 M, 3/10 F) Decreases in thymus weights in HD animals correlated with histologic 
evidence of lymphoid depletion. Plasma phenyto1n levels were 3-4 times higher following HD fosphenytoin 
53 administration than after p~.artf\Oin injection by the im route; concentrations ranged from 46.7 to 48.9 ug/ml 
after the HD of fosphenytoin and from 15.2 to 23.8 ugtml after an equimolar dose of phenytoin (Table 111.4). 
Dogs 
Foi.;r groups of dogs (3/sex/group main study, 1/sex/group recovery) were given iv bolus doses of fosphenytoin 
at O (vehicle), 15, 30, or 50 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Clinical signs were observed with a 0-R incidence in treated 
dogs and consisted of emesis. diarrhea, salivation, erylhema of the gums, hypoactivity, ataxia, mydriasis, and 
tremors (HD only). No deaths occurred. There were no significant T-R effects on weight gain or food 
consumption. Hematological parameten; were comparable among groups. Serum ALP was elevated about 
2-fold in HD dogs compared to C at 4 weeks and after a 4-week recovery period. Increased salivary gland 
weights and hypertrophy of mandibular and parotid salivary gland acini were noted in HD dogs. There was 
a trend toward increased liver weights in MD and HD animals, but no apparent histological correlate. Small 
(10%) increases in absolute and relative heart weights were seen in MO and HD males, but no pathology was 
seen upon microscopic examination. No differences in the incidence or severity of injection site alterations 
were noted between vehicle controls and treated groups. Plasma phenytoin levels 30 after dosing during week 
2 increased approximately dose-proportionaiely and were similar between sexes; mean concentrations ranged 
from 6.6 at the LO to 23. 7 uglml in the HO group (Table 111.5). 
Fosphenytoi11 was administered im to 5 groups of dogs (4/sex/group) at dose levels of 15, 30, and 60 
mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. A negative control group was administered saline, and a positive control group 
received phenytoin sodium (40 mg/kg, equimolar to HO). Ataxia, decreased activity, and mucoid diarrhea 
were observed in the HD group, and emesis and ptyalism were seen in all fosphenytoin-treated dogs in a 
dose-related manner. Ataxia, emesis, and diarmea were observed in the phenytoin group, with incidences 
intermediate between that seen in the MD and HO fosphenytoin groups. Both phenytoin and fosphenytoin 
groups exhibited swelling at the injection sites. All animals survived to termination. SW gain was increased 
in male fosphenytoin-treated dogs and decreased in phenytoin group males and females compared to saline 
controls. No changes in hematologic values were noted in the analysis of blood samples. However, one HD 
fosphenytoin female had an elevated myeloid/erylhroid ratio (M/E = 6.1) in the bone marrow smear performed 
QQ§! mortem, indicating repressed erylhrogenesis. Alkaline phosphatase and creatine phosphokinase levels 
were mode1.Jtely elevated in MD, HO and PC groups. The former was probably related to hepatic enzyme 
induetion and the latter may have been related to muscle tissue injury. A dose-related increase in liver weights 
occurred in fosphenytoin-treated males (+35% at HD) and females ( .. 28% at HO). Liver weight was also 
increased in the PC group ( .. 28% M, 14% F). Livers of 1 male and 1 female from the phenytoin group and 
of all females from the HD fosphenytoin group showed diffuse increases in intracytoplasmic vacuoliZation of 
hepatocytes. Injection site changes were observed in dogs from the phenytoin group and from the MD and 
HD fosphenytoin groups, but were reportedly more extensive and severe in the phenytoin group. Phenytoin 
levels peaked at approximately 60 min after prodrug administration (Table 111.6), averaging 25.5, 23.3, and 
28 ug/rr.l on days 1, 42 and 91, 1espectively, in the HD group (there was no apparent effect of repeated 
dosing). Peak phenytoin levels in the phenytoin group were consistently about 1/3 times those in the 
eqwmolar fosphenytoin group, averaging 8.6, 7.8, and 8.1 uglml on days 1, 42, and 91 (also comparable over 
time). In the phenytoin group, measurable phenytoin levels were still present in samples collected just prior 
to dosing. indicating skm absorption after im injection. No phenytoin was measured in predose samples from 
fosphenyto1n groups. 
SPECIAL TOXICITY 
Local imtation 
Fosphenytoin produced significantly less venous and perivascular imtation (based on macroscopic irritation 
scores) than phenyto1n at equ1molar concentranons. Local irritation after im mjection of fosphenytoin to rabbits 
was significantly lower than after im phenytoin. When injected im into the hindlimb of rabbits daily for 5 
consecutive days. phenytoin was more irrtating than !lquimolar concentrations of fosphenytoin. 
54 Cardiovascular affects .. 
The cardiovascular effects of equimolar doses of phenytoin (18 mg/kg) and fosphenytoin (27 mg/kg) were 
comparable following iv bolus (3 sec) injection to anesthetiZed female dogs (4/group). Intravenous phenytoin 
resulted in decreases in heart rate (80% of baseline), LvdP/dt (max -55% compared to C), and MAP (-40% 
compared to C) and significanlfy increased LVEDP (2-3-fold). Fosphenytoin resulted in more gradual 
decreases in HR (80% of baseline). LvdP/dt (max -36% compared to C), and MAP (-40% compared to C and 
baseline). Effects on LVEOP were variable and did not appear to be as pronounced as those produced by 
phenytoin administration. Effects on CV parameters appeared to correlate with phenytoin blood levels in both 
cases. The major difference between drugs was in E fleets on L VEOP. The less pronounced effects seen after 
fosphenytoin presumably reflect the lower peak blood level of phenytoin resulting from its administration (22 
ug/ml vs 49 ug/ml after phenytoin administration). (Flgurea IV.1 & IV.2 and Table IV.1) 
Formaldeh~'de fonnation 
Tl'-.e theoretical maximum dose of formaldehyde (assuming complete, instantaneous conversion) after an iv 
d;ise of 2100 mg fosphenytoin (30 mg/kg is given as maximum dose in proposed labeling) would be 5.17 
mmol or about 0.1 mmoVkg (3 mglkg) for a 50 kg person. The pharmacokinetics of formaldehyde and its major 
metabolite, formate, were modeled using data from a published report in which formaldehyde (30 mg/kg) was 
administered iv to monkeys. Based this model, peak formaldehyde and formate concentrations resulting from 
first order inru: of 3 mg/kg formaldehyde (formation half-life= 8 min) were simulated (Figures IV. 3 and IV.4). 
These simulations were analogous to bolus administration of a fosphenytoin dose of 2100 mg. Peak 
formaldehyde levels were predictecJ to be approximately 0.18 mmol/L, with concentrations declining to 
background levels (0.027-0.068 mmol/L) within 20 min. Maximal formate levels were predicted to be 0.08 
mmol/L, which is below the baseline levels measured in 2 monkeys in a published study (0.18 and 0.27 
mmol/L). Background levels of formate in humans have been reported in the literature to be 0.07 to 0.4 
mmol/L 
Since the theorelical maximum dose of formaldehyde represents only a fraction of the total body burden from 
normal metabolism (36 g/day in a 50 kg person), and since the PK simulations indicated that formalaehyde 
concentrations would exceed background levels for a relatively short time, the sponsor considers the potential 
risks associated with formaldehyde exposure as a result of fosphenytoin administration to be negligible. 
Plasma formate levels measured in 4 healthy volunteers following administration of 1200 mg of fosphenytoin 
l>y iv infusion over 30 min were not significantiy different from those observed in a placebo group or from 
baseline levels (25 mg/l). (The dose and infusion rate used in this study were considerably lower than the 
maximurri values in the proposed dosing recommendations, ie, 30 mg/kg and 225 mg/min, respectively; and 
the sample was very small.) 
GENETIC TOXICITY 
No biologically significant effects on revertant frequencies were seen with fosphenytoin in the Ames test. 
Fosphenytoin was negative tor effects on mutation frequency at the HGPRT locus in V79 Chinese hamster 
lung cells were evaluated after exposure to fosphenytom concentrations up to 4000 ug/ml in the abse,,ce or 
presence ot metabolic activation. Structural chromosome aberration frequency in V79 Chinese hamster lung 
cells was increased by sxposure to fosphenytoin concentrations > 1000 ug/ml in the presence of metabolic 
activation (Table V.1 & V.2). In mice given single iv doses of up to 200 mg/kg (iv LD50 = 234 mg/kg), no 
biologically s1g~ificant differences in micronucleus formation were detected. 
REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY 
Segment I Ima/el 
Male rats (40/grp) were dosed with 0, 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, im, tor 75 days prior to mating and thmughout 
55 ~. 
mating with untreated females (1:1 cohabitation, 10 day maximum), then sacrificed. Females were either 
sacrificed on Day 21 of gestation (1/2) or allowed to deliver and wean their offspring. Paternal toxicity, 
characterized by clinical signs (injection site lesions, neurotoxicity) and suppression of BW gain, occurred 
at the MD and HD. Two HD miilas died and 2 were sacrificed moribund. Mean plasma phenytoin 
concentrations ranged from about 5 (LO) to 45 ug/ml (HD) and did not appear to accumulate during 
treatment. No T-R effects were apparent for male reproductive parameters, including semen evaluation. 
FO fertility indices were decreased compared to historical data, but both control and treated males were 
affected. No biologically significant effects on female reproductive or fetal parameters were observed at 
C-section. There was a slight increase in stunted fetuses (<4 g) at the HD, but the value was within the 
historical control range. In litters from females allowed to deliver, there were no T-R effects on reproductive 
parameters or on neonatal groWth, survival, and acquisition of d!'velopmental landmarks. In addition. no 
group differences were found in several postweaning tests of neurobehavioral function, and there were no 
treatment effects on F1 reproductive parameters. 
Segment I (female) 
Female rats (40/grp) were dosed with 0 (vehicle), 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg, im, for Hi days prior to mating 
with untreated males. and throughout mating, gestation, and lactation. C-sections were performed on 1/2 
of the females on Day 21 of gestation; remaining females were allowed to deliver and wean their offspring. 
A high incidence of neurotoxicity (hypoactivity, ataxia, and prostration) was observed in HD females, which 
is consistent with the blood levels achieved at this dose (33-38 ug/ml). Similar CNS signs have been 
reported at plasma phenytoin levels >25-30 ug/ml, in rats and humans. BW gain was decreased in MD and 
HD females during the premating and gestation periods. Estrous cycles were altered at the MD and HD, 
but mating and fertility indices were unaffected. Parturition was significantly delayed at the HD, and 
disturbed at all doses. Fosphenytoin produced developmental toxicity primarily at the HD (decreased 
growth, increased intrauterine and postnatal death, malformations, functional effects; Tables Vl.3-5), 
although there were effects on growth at the MD. The MD and HD produced peak maternal plasma 
phenytoin concentrations of approximately 20 and 40 ug/ml, respectively ( 10-20 ug/ml considered 
therapeutic). Teratogenicity (cardiac, digit, brain anomalies) was significant at the HD; however, the 
occurrence of a brain malformation in a single LO fetus may have been drug-induced, since brain 
malformations are rare and have been previously reported after prenatal phenytoin exposure. 
Chromodacryorrhea and circling were seen in HD offspring; these have been previously reported after 
prenatal phenytoin exposure. 
Segment II frat) 
Pregnant rats (40/group) were treated with O (vehicle), 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg, iv, on gestation Days 7 
through 17. C-sections were performed on 25/group on Day 21; the remaining 15/group were allowed to 
deliver and rear offspring. Maternal toxicity occurred primarily in HD dams and consisted of death \4 HD 
dams), clinical signs (salivation, chewing, ataxia, hypoactivity, and limb rigidity), and suppression of BW 
gain. Mean maternal plasma phenytoin levels at 1 hr postdosing (approximate Cmax) were 4, 24, and 43 
ug/ml in LO, MO, and HO groups, respectively. Al C-section, postimplantation loss was increased (2-fold) 
in HD dams compared to concurrent and historical controls. Mean fetal BW was decreased (30% below 
VC) 1n the HD group. Incidences of skeletal malformations, extemaVvisceral variations, and skeletal 
vanations were increased in HD litters (Table Vl.7) Although classified as malformation~. ~'!veral of the 
skeletal anomalies (hemicentra) may have reflected retarded ossification. The increase i.~ variations was 
due to a marked increase in growth retarded fetuses in HD litters; 60% of HD fetuses were stunted (BW 
<4 g). Among dams allowed to deliver, the duration of gestation was significantly increased at the HO. 
Postimptantation loss was slightly increased at the MD and HO (Table Vl.9). Birth weights and postnatal 
weight gain were decreased in HD males and females (10-15%). Vaginal opening was delayed in MD and 
HD female pups Two littermates in the HD group exhibited abnormal circling behavior, and 27 pups from 
8 HD litters had chromodacryorrhea. Both have previously been associated with prenatal phenytoin 
56 exposure. One of the HD circTers later died (PND 23). Locomotor activity was increased in HD males on 
PND 42; however, ttlis was mostly due tc increased activity in a single HD pup. No group differences were 
found in acoustic startle parameters on P 43 or in shuttle avoidance parameters during week 9. 
Segment II /rebbitl 
Pregnant rabo1ts (20/group) were treated with 0 (vehicle), 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, iv, on gestation days 6 
through 18. C-sections were performed on Day 30 of gestation. Maternal toxicity, charactenzed by clinical 
signs (chewing motions, ataxia, limb rigidity, and shallow, rapid breathing) and suppression of BW gain, 
occurred at the MD and HD. Mean matf'ma1 plasma phenytoin levels increased proportionally from about 
7 (LO) to 35 uglml (HD). No T-R effects on maternal reproductive or fetal developmental parameters were 
apparent at C-section. 
Segment Ill 
Female rats (25/group) were treated with 0 (vehicle), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, iv, from Day 15 of pregnancy 
through Day 20 postpartum. Maternal toxicity, characterized by death, significant reductions in BW gain, 
and clinical signs (ataxia, hypoactivity, and imbalance), was observed primarily in HD group females. A 
D-R increase in gestation length was seen in treated dams, a!ld postimplantation loss was dose­
dependently increased at all doses (Table Vl.10). Pup survival and BW at birth were significantly 
decreased at the HD, but were !nwer than controls at all doses. The effect on BW persisted into the 
maturation period in HD group offspring. Increased pup mortality and reduced postnatal growth have 
previously been reported after oral administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg of phenytoin on Days 7-18 of 
gestation. There was no increase in malformations among fosphenytoin exposed offspring, but treatment 
started after the major penod of organogenesis. An increased incidence of structural variations in fetuses 
irom dams that died around the time of parturition can be attributed to developmental delay. Hyperactivity 
was apparent in all treatment group mate offspring, b!lt values for activity parameters were outside the 
control range primarily in HD offspring. Enhanced avoidance responding and apparent memory 
enhancement were seen in treatment group offspring (MD & HD males, HD females), probably due to 
exposure-induced hyperactivity. Circling behavior, which has previously been reported following prenatal 
exposure to phenytoin and was seen in the segment II study, was not observed in this study. No apparent 
effects on the reprOductive performance of F1 offspring were observed.

58 60 VIII. EVALUATION ~. 
Fosphenytoin is a water soluble phosphate ester prodrug of phenytoin, intended as a replacement for 
parenteral phenytoin (poorly soluble, requires an alkaline organic solvent and pr;,,cipitates in iv fluids). 
Fosphenytom is quantitatively converted to phenytoin in vivo by ubiquitous phosphatases, with a conversion 
halt~ife of about 8, 3, and <1 min in man, dog, and rat. respectively. Because of the phosphate ester, 150 mg 
fosphenytoin yields 100 mg phenytoin. The properties of phenytoin are well established; therefore, the primary 
safety issues with fosphenytoin relate to possible differences in the pharmacologicautoxicological profile of 
phenytoin resulting from admmistration of the prodrug. These differences could involve intrinsic effects of 
fosphenytoin, changes in phenytoin d.sposition, or effects of breakdown products, as discussed below. 
Fosphenytoin and phenytoin were equipotent against MES-induced seizures in mice after oral, ip, or iv 
adm1nistrati0n (Table Vlll.1 ). Although time courses of anticonvulsant action were comparable when the two 
drugs were given iv, there was some indication of a delayed onset after fosphenytoin administration. This 
delay could be important in the treatment of status epileplicus. A published study by Walton and Treiman 
(Epilepsy Res 5:165-8,'90) indicated that fosphenytoin was less effective than phenytoin in a rat model of 
statu~ epileplicus. Although similar final plasma and brain phenytoin concentrations were reached after ip 
administration of the twu drugs, a slower rise in brain phenytoin levels following fosphenytoin administration 
was thought to reduce its anticonvulsant efficacy in this animal model (Figure Vlll.1 ). Thus, the lime required 
for conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytnin could have a negative impact on the effectiveness of treatment. 
However. clinical iv Pl< studies have shown that free phenytoin concentration-time profiles similar to those 
seen with parenteral phenytoin can be obtained by increasing the fosphenytoin intusion rate. This is partly due 
to altered protein binding of phenytoin in the presence of fosphenytoin. In vitro studies and clinical PK data 
indicate that fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin from plasma binding sites, ie, the phenytoin tree traction 
increased with increasing fosphenytoin concentrations. In human volunteers, lhe extent of phenytoin 
displacement for a given dose, and therefore the Cmax and AUC values for tree phenytoin, increased with 
the infusion rate. Following infusion of fosphenytoin (1200 mg PE-phenytoin equivalents) at 100 and 150 mg 
PE/min, increases in free fraction resulted in free phenytoin con;.;entrations and tmax values similar to those 
seen after administration of an equimolar dose of phenytoin at the maximum recommended rate of 50 mg/min. 
Such infusion rates of fosphenytoin are reportedly w ... : tolerated. At steady-state, administralior. of 
fosphenytoin could enhance the pharmacological or toxicological effects of phenytoin by displacing it from its 
binding sites, although the increase in free fraction would be transient. The potential for such displac1Jment 
effects was not addressed in the preclinical studies; free phenytoin levels were not determined in any of the 
1n vivo animal studies. 
Phenytoin has been shown to produce significant reductions in blood pressure when infused iv in bot.h animals 
and man. Phenytoin-induced hypotension appears to be dependent on both total dose and rate of infusion. 
The maximum recommended adult human infusion rate is 40-50 mg/min and the total dose is usually limited 
to 1250-1500 mp. In a study comparing the hemodynamic effects of phenytoin and fosphenytoin in dogs, 
qualitatively and quantitatively similar changes in CV parameters were seen: both drugs produced comparable 
decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. When the CV effects of fosphenytoin (21 mg/kg PE) 
1ntusion over 15-30 min were compared with those s1:ien after infusion of an equimolar dose of phenytoin over 
30 min, the maximum effects were nearly identi1;al and were observed at comparable plasma levels of 
phenytoin (Figures 1.4-6). The rapidity of fosphen·f!oin infusion (within the range tested) appeared to affect 
the onset but not the maximu'Tl re>ponse. At times when plasma levels of both fosphem;toin and phenytoin 
(formed from fosphenytoin) were high, effects were not greater than those seen at crJmparable levels of 
phenytoin alone; therefore, it did not appear that fon~enytoin had any significant hemorJynamic effects of its 
own. When higher equimolar doses (40 mg/kg PE) w~re rapidly infused (over 2 min). the magnitude of the 
changes in CV parameters produced by fosphenytoin appeared to be somewhat greate1r than those seen with 
phenytom (Figures 1.1-J). However, 3 of the phenytoin-treated animals (ie, the most sensitive to CV effects) 
died within 4 mm of infusion onset following mark&:! reductions in MAP and HR, while, all 6 fosphenytoin dogs 
recovered; so the means depicted in the figures may be misleading. Although the CV changes produced by 
fosphenytoin seemed to correlalF with plasma leve\s of phenytoin, and similar peak total phenytoin 
concentrations were achieved after phenytoin or fosphenytoin administratio•1. it is possible that the 
59 displacement effect describeq.i11 the preceding paragraph resulted in higher maximal free phenytoin levels 
following rapid fosphenytoin infusion. which might have contributed to any increased response observed. In 
addition, formaldehyde formation could have added to the CV effects seen after rapid infusion of fosphenytoin. 
Formaldehyde has been shown to decrease the rate and contractility of isolated rat atria in vitro, and 
cardiodepression has been reported in rats infused with 0.12 mmol/kg/min formaldehyde (Strubel! et al, J 
Toxicol Clin Toxicol 28:221-33.'90). The rate of fosphenytoin ir'usion in the dog study was 0.08 mmol/l<g/min. 
However, the theoretical maximal rate of exposure to formaldehyde clinically, based on the proposed maximal 
rate of fosphenytoin administration (225 mg/min), would be 0.01 mmol/kg/min (50 kg BW). Fosphenytoin 
exhibited intrinsic activity only in one in vitro assay: the prodrug inhibited developed tension in a guinea pig 
left atrial preparation with a potency equivalent to that of phenytoin. Fosphenytoin was inactive in isolated right 
guinea pig atria, however. This in vitro effect is unexplained but unlikely to be of any clinical importance. 
The toxicological profile of fosphenytoin was essentially the same as that of phenytoin. The acute toxicity of 
fosphenytoin was equiva1ent to that of phenytoin when the two drugs were administered by iv infusion (30 
min) to mice, rats, rabbils, and dogs (Table 111.1). However, phenytoin was more toxic than fosphenytoin after 
single iv bolus administration to rats, probably due to a more gradual rise in phenytoin levels when 
fosphenytoin was given. When compared on an equimolar basis, im fosphenytoin produced more acute 
systemic toxicity than phenytoin in rats and dogs, presumably due to better absorption by this route (Table 
111.2). Fosphenytoin produced less injection site irritation than phenytoin by both the iv and im routes. 
Unfortunately, the only multiple dose toxicity studies that included a phenytoin positive control were the 3 
month im rat and dog toxicity studies. Because of its lower bioavailability by the im route, phenytoin was less 
toxic than an equimolar dose of fosphenytoin, except with regard to injection site irritation. Toxicokinetic 
studies indicated that equivalent phenytoin exposures (AUCs) were achieved after iv or im administration of 
fosphenytoin to rats and dogs (Tables 11.5 and 11.6). Peak phenytoin levels following im administration were 
about the same as those seen with iv administration in dogs and were about 112 iv peak levels in rats. 
Fosphenytoin was not measured in these high dose toxicokinetic studies. At a lower dose ( 1 O mg/kg PE), 
fosphenytoin exposures were equivalent following iv and im administration to dogs, but peak fosphenytoin 
levels were about 10-fold higher after iv administration (Table 11.3). Therefore, possible intrinsic effects of 
fosphenytoin or effects related to systemic formaldehyde may not have been adequately assessed ir. im 
toxicity studies. Effects on serum hepatic enzymes and liver weights observed in multidose studies in rats and 
dogs are known effects of phenyto1n in animals and are consistent with microsomal enzyme induction. 
Microscopic changes in the liver were attributed to increased cellular glycogen content secondary to 
phenytoin-induced hyperglycemia. Phenytoin causes hyperglycem1c' in animals and humans by inhibiting the 
insulin response to glucose stimulation. 
The in vivo hydrolysis of fosphenytoin produces 1 mole each of formaldehyde and phosphate for each mole 
or prodrug. No attempt to measure blood formaldehyde levels was made in any of the preclinical studies, but 
the pharmacokinetics of fonmdldehyde alld its major metabOlite formate were modeled using data from a 
published report in which formaldehyde was administered iv to monkeys, and formaldehyde and formate 
concentrations resulting from first order input of 0 1 mmol/kg of formaldehyde were simulated (Figures IV. 3 
& IV.4) This was considered to be the theoretical maximum human dose of formaldehyde, based on the 
complete conversion of an iv (bolus) fosphenytoin dose of 2100 mg (5.17 mmol or 0.1 mmol/kg using 50 kg 
BW). (The proposed MHD of fosphenytoin is 30 mg/kg at 225 mg/min.) Peak formaldehyde levels were 
predicted to be approximately 0.18 mmoVL, with concentrations declining to background levels (0.027-0.068 
mmoVL) within 20 min (formaldehyde is rapidly eliminated, with a t1/2 of 1 5 min in monkeys). Qualitative and 
quantitative similarities in formaldehyde metabolism hetween monkeys and humans suggest that these 
findings could be extrapolated to humans, but the actual data on which the PK model was based are very 
limited, ie, blood levels measured in 1 monkey. The toxicity of formaldehyde has been extensively examined, 
but inhalation has been the route of exposure in most studies. Effects were generally confined to the nasal 
and gastric ep1thelia after inhalation and oral administration of formaldehyde. Following a single iv injection, 
the median lethal dose of formaldehyde in rats was reported to be 87 mg/kg. The chronic toxicity of iv 
formaldehyde has apparently not been investigated. Formaldehyde is genotoxic in a variety of systems, and 
both chrome and subchromc inhalation exposures to high formaldehyde concentrations (15 ppm 6 hid) have 
resulted in the 1nducllon of squamous cell carcinomas in the nasal cavity of rats. However, despite the 
widespread exposure of humans to formaldehyde, epidemiological studies have not demonstrated that it 
60 represents a significantcancerrjf)\ to man (Heck et al, Critical Reviews in TiJxicology 20:397-426,'90). OSHA 
(Third Annual Report on Carcinogens, USOHHS Public Health Service,'83) has set permissible formaldehyde 
exposure levels at 3 ppm as an 8 hr time weighted average and 1 O ppm as a maximum peak concentration 
for 30 min in an 8 hr period, but there are no good estimates of acceptable plasma formaldehyde levels. It has 
been reported (J Piotrowski, Exposure Tests for Organic Compounds in Industrial Toxicology,'77) that workers 
exposed to formaldehyde at a concentration of 5.4 ppm (presumably 8-h TWA, but not stated) developed 
maximal blood levels of 0.13 mmoVL (ie, similar to predicted peak leveis after fosphenytoin). However, 
occupational exposure patterns may be very different from the pattern of formaldehyde exposure in 
tosphenyto1n-treated patients. Formald<Jhyde is generated during normal intermediary metabolism -the body 
turns over up to 50 g/day -and there are many sources of environmental exposure. Assuming that the 
simulations used by the sponsor are reasonably accurate, the formaldehyde formed from fosphenytoin would 
not be expected to overwhelm the body's detoxification capacity, and any elevatiOn in blood levels would likely 
be transient; however, clinical data are needed to verify the model (see original IND review of this issue). 
Intravenous administration of high concentrations of phosphate can result in toxicity due to reduction of Ca" 
1n the circulation and precipitation of calcium phosphate in tissues. This potential risk was not addressed by 
the sponsor. Although it is unlikely that the amount of ~hosphate which would be contributed by fosphenytoin 
administration (max -5 mmol) would raise serum concentrations to the levels which are associated with such 
effects (3.2 mmoVL), transient or local effects are possible. No findings obviously attributable to increased 
formaldehyde or phosphate exposure were observed in the fosphenytoin acute studies or in the 4-week 
toxicity studies at iv bolus doses up to 5 (rats) and 1.5 (dogs) times the maximum human dose (mg/kg basis). 
The maior pathway for metabolism of formaldehyde involves oxidation to formate and incorporation into 
biological macromolecules via tetrahydrofolate-dependent one-carbon synthetic pathways. Since forma\e 
accumulation is thought to be responsible for the known toxic effects of high dose methanol exposure (ie, 
severe metabolic acidosis and ocular toxicity), formate toxicity also represents a potential concern with 
fosphenyto1n administration and may be more relevant to short-term use. Hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase and 
catalase metabolize methanol to formaldehyde, then a glutathione-mediated pathway involving formaldehyde 
dehydrogenase rapidly metabolizes formaldehyde to formic acid. The accumulation of methanol-derived 
formate to toxie levels is primarily influenced by the rate of formate metabolism, which depends on the activity 
of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, methenyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, and the cosubstrate 
tetrahydrofolate. Following MeOH administration, formate has been shown to accumulate in the blood of 
primates but not of rodents or other nonprimates, and this is thought to account for a species difference in 
susceptibility to MeOH poisoning. Tissue tolate levels are thought to be key determinants of susceptibility to 
neuro-ocular toxicity following exposure to methanol. Primates have lower total liver folate concentrations, 
slower formate metabolism, and are thus more sensitive to methanol-induced toxicity compared to resistant 
species such as rodents. This interaction of formate and folate may be especially important in view of the fact 
that phenytom and other AEDs have been shown to interfere with folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. 
Folate depletion due to chronic AED therapy or other causes could increase formate levels during 
fosphenytoin administration. Furthermore, because of species differences in formate metabolism, the 
preclinical toxicity studies of fosphenytoin in rats and dogs are probably not appropriate for evaluating possible 
toxic effects related to the metabolism of the prodrug to formate. However, neuro-ocular toxicity in methanol­
and formate-poisoned monkeys (Martin-Amat et al, Arch Ophthalmol 95:184 7-1850, '77; Martin-Amat et al, TAP 
45:201-208,'78) and in met'lanol-poisoned humans (Mahieu et al, Human Toxicol 8:135-137,'89; McMartin 
et al, Am J Med 68:414-418,'80) is reportedly associated with marked elevations in blood formate 
concentrations (>7-10 mM) for prolonged periods of lime (often> 24 hr). In a folate-reduced rat model of 
methanol toxicity (Murray et al, Arch Ophthalmol 109:1012-1016,'91), exposure to blood formate 
concentrations of 8-12 mmol/L for more than 12 hr was required to produce changes in ERG and 
ultrastructural damage to the retina and optic nerve following administration of methanol (4 g1kg ip followed 
by 2 g/kg every 12 hr for 60 hr); formate levels up to 3 mmoVL were not toxic in this model (Louis-Ferdinand, 
personal communication). Formate has also been shown to be embryotoxic and dysmorphogenic to 
developing mouse and rat embryos in vitro at concentrations >1 O mM (Dorman et al, Teratology 52:30-40,'95). 
In the PK simulations described above, maximal formate levels after admtnistration of a 2100 mg dose of 
fosphenyto1n were not predicted to exceed the range of background concentrab:ms (0.1-0.56 mM). Based on 
these proiected levels, formate formed from fosphenytoin should not constitute r significant hazard. However, 
while plasma formate levels were measured in 4 volunteers following admrnistratior. of fosphenytoin and did 
61 not increase signiflcantiy aboviz ,those observed in a placebo group or baseline levels (all -0.5 mmol/L). the 
dose and infusion rate used in this study (1200 ;ng over 30 min) were well below the maximum values in the 
proposed dosing recommendations (30 mg/kg at 2.25 rr111min); therefore, additional human data are needed. 
Note to clinical f!ViBwer. Because the safety data rela1ed to formaldehyde and phosphate are so limited, a 
request that the sponsor measure blood levels of formaldehyde and/or formate and assess any changes in 
calcium concentration or acid-base equilibrium following administration of fosphenytoin to humans at the 
maximum recommended dose should be considered. 
Developmental toxicity seen in rats given fosphenytoin is consistent with that previously reported with 
phenytoin; however, no direct comparisons were made in the current reproductive toxicology studies. Segment 
I studies were conducted using im administration. As noted above, toxicokinetic studies indicated that similar 
phenytoin exposures (AUCs) were achieved after iV or im administration of fosphenytoiri, but the question of 
im fosphenytoin bioavailability has not been adequately addressed. In the female Segment I study, maternal 
and reproductive toxicity were evidenced at 75 and 150 mg/kg by decreased maternal l ·Jdy •veignt gain, 
altered estrous cycles, and delayed parturition. Developmental toxicity, including tllratogenic an:! functional 
effects (decreased growth, increased intrauterine and postnatal death, cardiar, and digit anomalies, 
chromodacryorrhea, and circling), occurred primarily at 150 mg/kg, although 1 brain malformation seen at 
the LO (16.6 mg/kg) may have been treatment-induced and there were effects on growth at the MO. In a rat 
iv teratology study, dP.velopmental toxicity (growth retardation, chromodacryorrhea, increased locomotor 
activity, circling) was seen at 100 mg/kg along with overt maternal toxicity (neurotoxicity, decreased weight 
gain. dystocia). In an iv Segment Ill study, decreased pup survival and growth and offspring behavioral 
changes (hyperactivity) were observed at doses as low as 50 mg/kg, with maternal toxicity over the same 
dose range. The developmental effects of fosphenytoin were very similar to those reported in the literature 
following administration of phenytoin to rats, and they occurred at maternal plasma phenytoin levels 
comparable to those associated with developmentally toxic doses of phenytoin (ie. therapeutic levels or 
greater). The appearance of neurotoxicity (lethargy, ataxia, and imbalance) has previously been reported 
at plasma phenytoin concentrations <!JO ug/ml, which is consistent with the levels observed in the present 
study following neurotoxoc doses of fosphenytoin. Embryolethality, IUGR, and defects encompassing the 
cardiovascular, urogenital, craniofacial, and skeletal systems have been variably demonstrated in mice, 
rats, and rabbits exposed to phenytoin in urero. Cardiac malformations similar to those seen in HO fetuses 
in the rat Segment I study with fosphenytoin are typical of the fetal hydantoin syndrome in humans as well 
as those previously reported in !>henytoin-exposed rat fetuses. The incidence of ectrodactyly was also 
increased in HO fosphenytoin treated fetuses in this study, and digit malformations such as adactyly and 
digital phalangeal hypoplasia have been reported in rodents and humans following prenatal exposure to 
phenyto1n. Decreased postne.ial viability and growth, chromodacryorrhea. increased locomotor activity. and 
circling behavior have also been reported in rats after prenatal phenytoin exposure (Vorhees, Teratology 
35:287-303,'87). Thus, studies examining the reproductive and developmental effects of fosphenytom 
confirm previous findings with phenytoin, but do not indicate any additional toxicity resulting from 
administration of the prOdrug. 
Fosphenytoin wa! clastogenic in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells in vitro but negative in in vitro mutagenicity 
a3says and in the mouse micronucleus test in vivo. The sponsor postulated that the clastogenic effect was 
due to the generation of formaldehyde in vitro, since the effect was seen in the metabolic activaticr assay 
only Phenytoin was reportedly not clastogenic in previous studies with CHO cells, while formaldehyde 
has been reported to induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro in CHO cells at concentrations as low as 
5 ug/ml. As mentioned above, formaldehyde is genotoxic in a variety of in vitro assays, eg, increased mutation 
frequencies in Chinese hamster V79 cells were induced by formaldehyde at 0.3-1 mM concentrations; but no 
m vivo mutagenicity has been reported. Attempts to measure formaldehyde in cultures treated with 
fosphenytom were unsuccessful. Addition of fonnaldehyde dehydrogenase to the SS is a possible approach 
to addressing this question. AlltY.lUgh one could assume that conversion to phenytoin would take place in the 
presence of SS. the extent of fosphenytoin hydrolysis in vitro was not measured in any of the genotoxic1ty 
assays. It seems likely that the clastogenicity of fosphenytoin is due •o formaldehyde formation, but this has 
not been supported by data and could not be stated in the labeling Without additional worl<. 
62 Labeling .. 
The Carcinogenicity and Pregnancy sections of the labeling are inaccurate and/or inadequate. Despite the 
findings in Chinese llamster lung cells, the statement is made that fosphenytoin was neither mutagenic nor 
clastogenic. The prilgnancy category should be D, based on the known • or at least strongly suspected -
hu'Tlan developmental toxicity of phenytoin; and since phenytoin has a pregnancy warning, fosphenytoin 
warrants the same. The warning needs to be .updated or rewritten by the sponsor so that the information 
reflects the current scientific consensus regarding the effects of phenytoin on human development. Where 
adequate data are available, risk estimates and factors affecting risk should be included. The fosphenytoin 
animal findings, which are giVen 1 sentence in the proposed labeling, should be described in more detail. 
There are also some minor errors in the Mechanism of Action section. Suggested changes are as follows: 
Mecho.nism of Action 
In the second paragraph, replace the first three sentences with the following (in italics; sponsor's 
reference numbers retained): 
After intravenous (IV) administration to mice, fosphenytoin blocked the tonic phase of maximal 
electroshock seizures at doses tllat are equivalent (on a molar basis) to those effective for phenytoin. 
In addition to its ability to suppress maximal electroshock seizures in mice and rats', phenytoin 
exhibits anticonvulsant activity against kindled focal and secondarily generalized seizures in rats', 
audiogenic tonic-clonic seizures in mice'. and generalized seizures produced by electricat stimulation 
of the brainstem in rats•. The cellular mechanisms of phenytoin ... 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Replace the second sentence in proposed text with the following: 
The carcinogenic potential ot fosphenytoin is not known. Structural chromosome aberration frequency 
in cultured V79 Chinese hamster lung cells was increased by exposure to fosphenytoin 
concentrations ~ 1000 ug/ml in tne presence of metabolic activation. No evidence of mutagenicity was 
observed in bacteria or Chinese hamster lung cells in vitro. and n0 increase in micronucteus formation 
occurred after administration to mice in vivo. 
Add the following dosage information to the last sentence: 
... following administration of fosphenytoin during mating, gestation, anri lactation at doses of 75 c>~d 
150 mg/kg/day, or approximately 40% and 80%, respectively, of the maximum twman daily dose 
(MHDD; 30 mg/kg) on a mglm2 basis. 
Pregnancy -Category D; see Wamings. 
Add tile following sentence at the beginning of the first paragraph of the current, or updated, Dilan tin 
Usage in Pregnancy warning: 
Although there are no studies of fosphen}'loin in pregnant women, epidemiological data indicate that 
prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse 
developmental outcomes. 
63 ---- --U!l.!l!J". In Pregnancy: A number of reports suggests an association betw6an the use of 
ahn.1
11ep1leptic drugs by women with epilepsy and a higher incidence of birth defects in 
c ' dren bom to these women. Data are more eX:ensive with respect to phenytcin and 
phenoba~ital, but tlu!'9.are also the most commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs: less 
systematiC or anecdOtal reports suggest a possible similar associati."1n with the use of all 
known antiepileptic drugs. 
The reports suggesting a higher Incidence of birth defects in children of drug-treated 
epileptic women cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite cause and effect 
relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in obtaining adequate data on 
drug taratoganlcity in humans; genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more 
important than drug therapy in leading to birth defer.ls. The great majority of mothers on 
anliepileptic medication deliver normal infants. It is important lo note that anUaplleptic 
drugs should not be discontinued in patients in who.n the drug is administered to preveni 
major -;alzu1 :.1s, because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epllepticus with 
attendant hypoxia and threat to fife. In individual cases where the severity and frequency 
of the seizure disorder are such that the removal o! medication does not pose a serious 
threat to the patlant, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to end during 
pregnancy, although ii cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do 
not pose soma hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. The prescribing physician will 
wish lo weigh these considerations in trea.o· >g or counseling epileptic women of childbear­
ing potential. 
In addition to the reports of increased incidence of congenital malformation such as cleft 
lip/palate and heart malformations in children of women receiving phenytoln and other 
antiepileptic drugs. there have more recently been reports of a fetal hydantoin syndrome. 
This consists of prenatal growth deficiency. microcephaly, and manta deficiency in chil­
dren bom to mothers who have received phenytoin. barbiturates, alcohol, or trimetha­
dione. However, these features are all interrelated and are frequently associated With 
intrauterine growth retardation from other causes. 
There have been isolated reports of malignancies. including neuroblastoma, in children 
whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. 
An increase in seizure frequency during pregnancy occurs in a high proportion of patients, 
because of altered phenytoin absorption or metabolism. Periodic measurement of serum 
phenytoln levels is particularly valuable in the management of a pregnant epHeptic patient 
as a guide lo an appropriate adjustment of dosage. However, postpartum restoration of 
the original dosage will probably be indicated. 
Neonatal coagulation defects have been reported within the first 24 hours in babies born 
to epileptic mothers receiving phenobarbital ancllor phenytoin. Vitamin K has been shown 
to prevent or correct this defect and has been recommended to be given to the mother 
before delivery and the neo-iate after birth. 
Add the following paragraph after the human pregnancy information (sponso(s reference number) 
Fosphe11ytoin demonstrated developmenral rox;city, including structural and behavioral 
terarogenicity, in rats. When fosphenytom was administered to femav.i rats prior to and dunng 
mating, pregnancy, and lactation (25. 75. or 150 mg/kg/day), increased frequencies of 
ma/formation, death, and functional impa"ment were observed among the offspring of dams receiving 
150 mg/kg/day, or ap,woximately 80% of the maximum human daily dose (MHDO; 30 mg/kg) on a 
mglm2 basis. This dose produced peak maternal plasma phenytoin concentrations approximately 2-4 
times human therapeutic levels (10-20 uglm/) Offs;cring growth was reduced by doses of 75 
mg/kg/day (40% of MHDD on a mglm2 basis) or greater, and ma!emal toxicity was evident over the 
same dose range. \Mien pregnant rats were g1Ven lospheaytoin (10. 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) during the 
period of embryonic organogenes1s, growth retardation <1nd abnonnal postnatal function were 
observed in offspring exposed to 100 mg/kg/day (50% of MHDD on a mg/m'2 basis). Overt maternal 
toxicity was aiso associated with this dose. When female rats received fosphenytoin during the last 
third of pregnancy and throughout /aeration (25. 50, or 100 mg/kg/day), decreased offspring 
viability and growth and alterations m off>pring behavior were observed at doses of 50 
mg/kg/day (3096 of MHDD on a mg/m2 bas1sl or greater. Maternal toxicity was noted over the 
same dose range. The developmental effects of fosphenytoin in rats were similar to U10se which 
have been reponed following admm1stration of phenytoin to rats>.

·\1653-010 
Categor1: 
Anticonvulsant; prodrug for phenytoin. 
Sunrnary: 
It was nted out in our team meeting for this new drug that the in vivo 
hydroly~.• of, ·9653 occurs in 2 steps, producing one mole of formaldehyde 
for each mole of prodrug. In the initial clinical Phase I trial, the top dose 
of 2250 mg would produce 5.5 111110les of HCHO. The possible hazard from this 
burden will ue discussed from several different veiwpoints below. All 
calculations are gross approximations, based on available information. 
1. OSHA has adopted a p~rmissible exposure level for toxic effects of 
formaldehyde other than cancer of 3 ppm as an 8 hour time weighted 
average, anu 10 ppm maximum peak concentration fer 30 minutes in an 8 
hour period (Third Annual Report on Carcinogens, USDHHS Public Health · 
Service, September, 1\183, page 73). It has been repRrted that workers 
exposed to formaldehyde at a concentration of 7 mg/nrJ developed blood 
levels of 0.6 -4.0 mg/1. The durat ;on of exposurr; was not given 
(J.Piotrowski, Exposure Tests for Organic Compaounds in Industrial 
Toxicology, Gant Printin!I Office, DC, 1977, p. 122). [lm3 = 1000 l; wt. 
of air= 1.2!13 gms/l at ooc + 760 mm Hg;_therefore 7 mg/m3 e 7 
mgll «~!13 kg = 5.4 mg/kg • 5.4 ppm in a irj 
Since 5.4 ppm of HCHO~ a maximum of 4 n1g/l in blood, the 10 ppm maximum 
allowed by OSHA would-7 approximate: i.t 7 .4 mg HCH0/1 iter or 0.25 meg 
HCH0/1 in blood. This figure shoula more or less represent the maximal 
allowable blood level of HCHO accordinf to OSHA. If we then assume that 
the 5.5 111110les of HcHo that are split rom the prodrug all appear in the 
circulation (ave. volume 5 liters) the concentration would be 33 mg/1 or 
1. 1 me /1 or a roximatel 4 fold hi her than the OSHA level allowed. 
owever, t s s a very cru e es 1ma e since t e ata are not rea 1 y 
available for taking the time factor allowed under the OSHA limit into 
consideration. 
2. There is a great deal of information in the literature that suggests that it is formic acid that is repsonsible for the ocular toxicity and 
acidosis seen following acute methanol poisoning (methanol~ 
formaldehyde~ formate). This toxicity would be of greater concern wh~n 
dealing with a drug to be used acutely than would potential 
carcinogenicity. Although a role for HC~O has not been clearly ruled 
out, experiments in monkeys suggest that the resultant formate levels are 
of more concern. I 
f 
r . .. ··---·-. .... :,, .... - -
In a model fn rhesus 11e>nkeys for llllthanol ocular toxtcfty and metabolic 
acidosis, formate blood and CSF levels of 7 to 34 meq/l were associated 
with optic disc44il1111a, morphological alterations in optic nerve and 
swelling of olfyodendroglfal cytoplasm (Martfn -Amat, Hayreh, Baumtach 
et al, Arch Ophthalmol., 95, 1847-50, 1851-58, 1859-61; Martin-Amit, et.al., TAP, 45, 201-208-;-1978). Pretreatlllt!nt wfth folate increased the 
metabolfsm of l'Or111te and decreased the toxicfty (McMartin et al, JPET, 
201, 564-572, 1977). In the propct~~ clinical tr1al, ff we a;sume the 
~ meq of HCHO goes to 5.5 meq of.formate, with a blood concentration of 
1.1 meq/1, there 1s a minfllllm of a 7-f'old safet* factor before ocular 
toxicity occurred in the 1110nkey (which is thoug t to metabolize HCHO like 
the human). 
3. It has been reported that the mechanism for ocular toxicity caused by 
methanol ts the inhibition of cytochrome oxfdase by formate (Nicholls, 
BBRC, 67, 610-616, 1975). Si~ce cytochrome oxidise activity is low in 
white matter, ft has been sug~ested that fts actfvfty may be critical in 
that tissue. The Ki values 'determined for formate Inhibition of 
cytachrome oxidise are between 5 and 30 m M (above reference plus 
Martin-Aiii&t, Arch Ophtnol., 95, 1647-50, 1977). Based on this data, 
blood levels of formate of 1:1' m M would be somewhat lower then those 
expected to produce toxicity. 
~. In dogs and cats administered JS mg/kg (1.2 meq/kg) of formaldehyde by 
i.v. infusfon, a blood HCHO concentration of 25 mg/1 (0.83 meq/1) was 
produced wnich declined to about 1 my/1 by l ho~r after the infusion. i4 
x as much HCHO was in erythrocytes as in plasma). The P'j~ plasma · concentration of formate, however, wa~ 144 mg/1 (3. 1 meq at the end of 
the infusion, which declined with a TJ/2 of 1.5 hours. Toxicity was 
not addressed (G. Malorne; et al, Naunyn -Schmiedeb~rgs A.E.P.P., 250, 
419-436, 1965). These data would suggest that peak levels of the ~ 
?Ossibly 1110re toxic metabolite, formate, might be approximated as follows 
for top dose in the clinical trial: 
5 .5 meq of HCHO ( 155 mg) = 3 '".'.;/kg in a 50 kg person. If 35 mg/kg 
of i.v. HCHO ~144 mg/1 of formate, 3 mg/kg or HCHO may result in 
peak blood levels of formate of 12 mg or 0.26 meq/1. (This is 
assuming comparable relative blood fevles to body weight in humans 
and animals. Actually, dogs may have slfghtly larger blood 
volume/kg of body weight than humans, so the estimate for humans is 
possfbly on the low side. The assumption for comparable metabolism 
is also made) • 
This figur~is considerably lower than the Ki for formate inhibition of 
cytochrome oxidase and it is about 25-30 fold lower than the loweH 
levels of formate associated with ocular toxlcfty in monkeys (see numbers 
Z and 3 above). If instead, we examine the blood HCHO concentration 
using these data, an i.v. dose of prodrug that yields 5.5 mmoles of HCHO 
(0. 11 11!1110les/kg) would be expected to result in a peak blood 
concentration of HCHO of o.oa mmoles/liter, or 1/3 of the maximal 
allowable HCHO exposure according to oSRA. 
Evaluation and Reco1mM!ndations: 
The above approximations are extremely crude, but they do provide some data 
for evaluating the risk involved from a drug which will be used acutely that 
is metabolized to pruduce a mole of formal~ehyde for every mole of drug. · 1. 
I 
I . . ·--.... -. -
Based on OSHA lfmfts for exposure to formaldehyde, the guestfmate is that the 
top dose of prodrug planned Jn the rising dose trial (2250 mg) would result in 
anywhere from 1/3 of-tottimes the maximal allowable blood level of 
formaldehyde. If we· cssume that formate is responsible for the expected acute 
toxfcty (occular and actdosfs), there may be anywhere between i 7 fold and a 
30 fold safety factor, based or. toxicity observed in monkeys and blood levels 
of formate measured after t.v. administration of HCHO to dogs. If we believe 
that formate toxicity occurs through cytochrome oxtdase inhibitfon, there is 
at least a small margfn of safety based o.n the Ki. 
In any case, ft fs a close call, and there are a couple of precautions that 
might be considered. Monitoring of blood formic actd, blood pH, bicarbonate 
and pCOz is recommended. Sfnce folinfc acfd pretreatment hastens the 
elimination rate, a sapplement of 2 mg, p.o., might be given the day before 
the trtal. However, ff it 1s considered that this fs an appropriate time to 
determine whether or not forruate levels in blood are detectable (since fn 
practice there would not be time to give folinic acid) I would reco11111end 
careful monitoring for formate levels at all doses before proceeding to the 
next hfghe1 dose. SRO is Hay 4, so sponsor should be phoned.

156 IMPORTANT NOTE ... 
A previous Division of Biopharmaceutics reviewer requested that the Human 
Phannacokinetics and Bioavailability portion of the NDA be written with fosphenytoin doSCli 
and administtation rates expressed in phenytoin equivalents. Since the molecular weight of 
fosphenytoin is I.5X the molecular weight of phenytoin, phenytoin equivalents were 
calculated by multiplying the dose or adminsttation rate of fosphenytoin by 0.67. 
Not all of the NDA has fosphenytoin doses and rates expressed in terms of phenytoin 
equivalents. Fosphenytoin was initially developed b! and Parke-Davis 
did not convert t studies to express fosphenytoin doses and rates in phenytoin 
equivalents. 
The studies conducted after Parke-Davis' acquisition of fosphenytoin arc the most 
critical in evaluating the application. Thus, they constitute the majority of the Synopsis and 
Summary. In order to provide consistency between photocopied portions of the NOA and 
portions of the review constructed de novo by the reviewer, doses and rates of fosphenytoin 
will be expressed in phenytoin equivalents in all portions of this review prior to the 
individual study reports. The convention used in the individual study reports ( Appendbc 2 ) 
varies according to that used in the NOA and is detailed below. 
The following studies were conducted by doses and rates are expressed 
WITIIOUT conversion to phenytoin equivalents: 98201, 98202, 98205, 98206, 98207, 
98210, and 98211. Studies 98213, 98214, 98215, 98216, 98218, 98220, and 98224 have 
doses and rates of fosphenytoin expressed as phenytoin equivalents. 
During site visits by the Division of Scier.tific Investigations, it was determined that 
plasma concentration measurements of fosphenytoin from studies conducted by Parke-Davis 
were inaccurate due to an error in the weighing of standards. This error did not affect 
dosing of fosphenytoin. Parke-Davis has since determined that the accuracy of plasma 
concentration measurements of fosphenytoin from studies is uncertain. A description 
of these inaccuracies is given in the "Response to EIRs identified in 483 Forms" section of 
this review ( p.to). The errors in fosphenytoin concentrations have NOT been documented 
in the individual study reports ( Appendix 2 ) . The values have little bearing on the 
interpretation of studies -the specie of clinical interest is generally plasma phenytoin, not 
plasma fosphenytoin. The errors arc accounted for in all portions of this review prior to the 
individual study reports ( Appendix 2 ). 
3 Synops~~ ... 
Fosphenytoin is a phosphate ester prodrug of phenytoin dc:veloped as an alternative 
for parenteral phenytoin. Only one fosphenytoin formulation ( the to-be-marketed 
formulation ) was studied clinically. Since fosphenytoin is a pher ytoin prodrug and no new 
therapeutic claims beyond those approved for parenteral. phenytoir: are being made, proof-of 
efficacy studies were not conducted. Rather, the development pre gram hopes to establish 
that fosphenytoin and phenytoin are bioequivalent sources of phenytoin. 
Study 98224 demonstrates that using the 90% confidence ir1terval approach a.1d the 
log 80 -125 % C. I. criteria, 1200 mg of IV fosphenytoin at 150 mg/min is bioequivalent to 
1200 mg IV phenytoin at 50 mg/min in terms of maximal free pht:nytoin concentration 
observed (Cmax) and area under the free concentration/time curve from t = 0 to the least 
quantifiable concentration (AUCo.n.nc>· A desired indication for :'osphenytoin is treatment 
of acute status epilepticus. Because rapid attainment of sufficient phenytoin plasma 
concentration is critical in treatment t•f ~tatus epilepticus, analyses were perfonned to 
compare cumulative AUC over time. Using the forementioned confidence interval approach, 
cumulative AUC1.., pb• following administration of 1200 mg of fosp'tenytoin at 150 mg/min is 
bioequivalent to the cumulative AUC1,,,.,.. following 1200 mg of phenytoin at 50 mg/min 
from 30 minutes onward. At doses of 1200 mg and rates of 50 and 100 mg/min, 
fosphenytoin is equivalent to 1200 mg phenytoin dosed at 50 mg/rr.in in terms of total 
AUC1noe p:it but not Cmax, ... ,.... 
Fosphenytoin exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics: as dose and rate of administration 
are mcre.ased, clearance increases. Fosphenytoin is highly protein bound, and its non-linear 
clearance is hypothesiud to result from protein binding c.:insiderdtions: as dose and rate of 
administration incr~ase, protein binding saturates and greater concentrations of free drug are 
available to be cleared. Independent of dose and rate of administra '.ion fosphenytoin is a 
short-lived specie; terminal elimination half-life of the drug is appnximately 15 min and, 
regardless of dose or rate of administration, fo~phenyt:>in is rarely quantifiable 5 hrs post­
dosing. The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin i! con.;1stent •llld essentially complete. 
Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin is readily absorbed when ad:nlllistered IM. Average 
bioavailability of phenytoin from 250 mg of IM fosphenytoin is 101 %. 
Study 98207 examined the disposition of fosphenytoin in renal failure and hepati<'.ally 
compromised patients. Fosphenytoin clearance is more than 2-fold as great in cirrhosis 
patients and about l. 8-fold as great in renal failure patients as in hetlthy volunteers. This is 
consistent with decreases in piasma protein concentrations in these patients reducing 
fosphenytoin binding and increasing the concentration of fosphenytoin available to be cleared. 
Because treatment of status epilepticus often includes concomitant administration of 
phenytoin and diazeparn, a drug interaction study of fosphe~ytoin w:.th diazepam was 
performed. Neither drug affertcd the pharmacokinetics of the other. However, submaximal 
doses of fosphenytoin and diazepam wert used in the study. 
4 . . . The analyucal methodology presented throughout the NOA was a validated 
assay. However, commercially available fluoresence immunoassays for phenytoin are 
routinely used to monitor phenytoin plasma concentrations. Cross-reactivity of these assays 
to fosphenytoin occurs. 
Differences in fosphenytoin disposition between age, gender, race or any other sub­
group were not observed and there is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacoldnetics due 
to differences in fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. 
Recommendation: 
The Human Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability pcrtion of New Drug Application 
20-450 meets the requirements of the Division of Pharmaceutical Evaluation I, Office cf 
Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics. Our !abeling revisions have been included in 
the comprehensive copy of labeling provided as Appt"ndix 1 of this review. Please note the 
"Comments to the Medical Officer" below. 
Comments to the Medical Officer: 
1. Study 98207, Conversion Of Cl-982 Io Phenytojn In Patients \17jth Renal Or 
He.gatjc Disease -A Pilot Study, was performed at low dose and low rate of 
fosphenytoin ( 250 mg al 8.3 mg I min ), and did 1101. measure free phenytoia. The 
use of low dose and low rate fosphenytoin is not optimal beu..1.1se the conditions with 
greatest potential for maximal deviation from the non:i are high dose and high rate. 
Failure to measure free phenytoin is problematic because it is free phenytoin which 
would be best correlated with efficacy and toxicity, Although the I'!'.sults obtainec.J do 
allow the sponsor to label that fosphenytoi11 r.learance is enhanced in patients with 
renal or hepatic disease, they are of ~1ttle value in advising a clinician on how to 
administer high dose and high rate fosphenytoin ( as woulC: be recommended in status 
epilepticu:; ) to individuals who are hepatically or renally ::ompromised. 
This study does demonstrate that neither renal nor hepatic disease have marked 
effects on the extent of cl"'nversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
2. Study 98211, Evaluation Of The Pharroacokjnetic Interaction Between Dianpam 
and CI-982· In Healthy Male Volunteers, was performed at submilllimal dose and rate 
of fosphenytoin ( 750 mg at 50 mg I min ) and submaximal dose of diazeparn ( 10 mg 
at S mg I min). Diazeparn, in status epilepticus, can be administered at doses up io 
30 mg I 30 min. Although a drug interaction was not observed in this study, the 
conditions with greatest potential for maximal deviation from the norm ( maximal 
dose and rate ) were not studied.

Fosphenytoin sodium (hereaflcr refemd to as fosphenytoin) is a prodrug of the 
anticonvulsant phenytoin, int"""ed for parenteral administr.uion. Fosphcnytoin is 
rapidly and completely convl!l'ted to phenytoin in vivo. The pharmacological effects 
of phenytoin derived from fosphenytoin are essentially the same as those of parenteral 
phenytoin. The anticonwlsant effects of phenytoin have not been observed with 
fosphenytoin prior to conversion to phenytoin. 
2.J.2. Scientific Rationale 
Parenteral phenytoin is used for the acute treatment and control of seizures in patients 
with status epilepticus, for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures in patients with 
epilepsy or in neurosur:gical patients, and as a substitute for oral pbenytoin when oral 
administration is not feasible. The current parenteral fonnulation is prepared in a 
vehicle of 40% propylene glycol and 10% ethanol adjusted to pH 12 with sodium 
hydroxide, and can be administered either intravenously or intramuscularly. 
Intravenous administration of phenytoin often produces local pain and burning and has 
also been associated with hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and severe tissue 
necrosis following extravasation. Intramuscular administration of phenytoin is not 
widely used because its absoi:ption is erratic and unreliable, it crymlliu:s at the 
htjection site, and it also produces local reactions. 
Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin is freely soluble in aqueous solutions and is 
fonnulated in TRIS buffer at a pH of 8.6 to 9.0. Fosphenytoin is rapidly and 
completely converted to pbenytcin in vivo. Parke-Davis developed fosphenytoin as an 
alternative to parenteral pbenytoin based on the assumption that its fonnulation 
without organic oolvents at a lower pH would result in better injection- or Infusion­
site tolerance and fewer of the complications associated with parenteral phenytoin 
administration. Tne development program focused on demonstrating bioequivalence 
between fosphenytoin ana phenytoin and the safety of fosphenytoin. Since 
fosphenytoin is a pbenytoin prodrug and no new therapeutic claims are being made 
beyond those ~y approved for parenteral phenytoin, proof-of-efficacy studies 
were not conducted. •• 
2.3.3. Potential Clinical Benefits 
Fosphenytoin is rapidly and complctcly. convened to phenytoin. With IV 
administratior. of equimolar lmding doses at the proper rate, fospbenytoin produces 
plasma concemrations of unbound phenytoin that are equivalent to those of IV 
Dilantin. Fospb.enytoin administered IM is readily absorbed and is fully bioavailabl.e. 
Fosphenytoin achieves thezapeutic plasma phenytoin concenttations with the following 
clinical benefits: 
• Fosphenytoin is sig.llfi.cantly better tolerued at the injection or i.'lfusion site than 
parenteral Dilantin. 
• Inttavenous administration of fosphenytoin has fewer complications than parenteral 
Dilantin, including decreases in infusion rate because of local irritation or 
hypotension, changes in the IV site, and complications from infilttation. 
• Fosphenytoin can be mixed with normal saline or 5 'Jli dextrose in water and 
administered without an in-line filter. 
• Fosphenytoin offers JM administration as a viable alternative route. 
2.3.4. Intended Use 
This New Drug Application (NDA) supports the short-term (up to 14 days) use of 
fosphenytoin for the acute treatment and control of seizures in patients with status 
epilepticus, for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures in patients with epilepsy or in 
neurosurgical patients, and as a substitute for onl phenytoin when oral administration 
is not feasible. Bioequivalence 
~. 
It is imperative to read IMPORTANT NOTE on p.3bcforc reading the following. 
As stated in the Introduction, the sponsor did not perform proof-of-efficacy studies 
with fosphenytoin, and desires that the drug be approved on the basi~ of biocquivalence with 
phenytoin. 
Because phenytoin is highly ( • 90% ) protein bound in vivo, free phenytoin is the 
specie of clinical importance. Studies 98220 and 98224 arc crossover studies comparing 
plasma free phenytoin concentrations following IV administration of fosphcnytoin and 
Dilantin.

Study 98224 demonstrates that, using standard bioequivalence criteria on free 
phcnytoin data, 1200 mg IV fosphenytoin at 150 mg I min is bioequivalent to 1200 mg IV 
Dilantin at 50 mg I min based on AUC and Cmax. Dissimilarly, at the 100 mg/min rate a.rid 
using free phcnytoin data, fosphenytoin and Dilalltin are equivalent for AUC but not 
equivalent for Cmax.

13 One of the desired indictions for fosµhenytoin is acute status epilipticus. Efficacy in 
this disorder is presumably dtte to rapid attainment of high concentrations of plasma free 
phenytoin. Therefore, free phenytoin AUC, 0• TLDC > may not be a measure of relevant 
exposure, and the sponsor was requested to calculate, across the first 2 hours JX'St-initiation 
of dosing, the ratio of cumulative free phenytoin AUC from fosphenytoin administration to 
that from phenytoin administration. At both the 100 and 150 mg/min infusion rates, the 90% 
confidence interval for Cumulative AUC falls within the 80 -125% range from about 30 
minutes onward. 
Studies 98220 and 98224 are the only investigations which attempt to show 
bioequivalence of free phenytoin from fo51 !ienytoin and Dilantin. They provide a scientific 
basis for dosing recommendations when maximal dose I infusion rate is desired ( eg. status 
epilepticus ) . 
Fosphenytoin Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma fosphenytoin concentrations increase with increasing dose and infusion rate 
and then decline with a terminal t1n of approximately 0.25 hr independent of dose and 
infusion rate. 
Fosphenytoin clearance is dependent upon both dose and infusion rate. Fosphenytoin 
is highly bound to plasma albumin ( approximately 95 3 bound at Cmax following high dose 
I high rate administration ), and the changes in clearance are hypothesized to be a result of 
nonlinear prot.:in binding: as dose and infusion rate increase, higher plasma fosphenytoin 
concentrations are attained, protein binding saturates, more free fosphenytoin is available to 
be metabolized, and fosphenytoin clearance is enhanced. The figure below illustrates the 
changes in clearance observed with changes in dosing regimen. 600

Dose, and Infusion Rate Following Intravenous 
Administration of Fosphenytoin to Healthy Subjects 
The effect of the above mentioned changes in clearance on the concentration-time 
profile are not easily summarized. No structure exists which allows for the change in 
clearance to be used to describe changes occuring "early" in the concentration-time profile. 
What is meant by "early" is prior to the terminal linear phase of elimination. The sponsor 
has shown that concentration-dependent changes in clearance are accompanied by 
proportional changes in fosphenytoi11 volume of distribution during the terminal linear phase 
of metabolism ( Vd..,. varies from 4.3L when 100 mg is infused at 3.3 mg I min to 10.~ L 
when 1200 mg is infused at 150 mg I min ). These Yd changes are consistent with a protein 
binding interaction model: as concentration increases free fraction increases and drug leaves 
plasma. The combination of increased clearance with increased Yd.,.. result in a constant 
elimination tin· 
Independent of dose, route or rate of administration, fosphenyotin is a short lived 
specie. The total number of individuals receiving serial sampling in studies 98213, 14, 15, 
15 16, 18, 20 and 24 was 124 ... Qf these 124 only 7 ( < 6%) had detectable fosphenytoin 
plasma concentrations at 5 or more hours post-initiation of administration. 
Based upon equal AUC of total phenytoin from IV phenytoin and from fosphenytoin, 
it appears that conversion of fosphenytoin is essentially complete. 
Special Populations 
A study with renal failure patients and hepatically compromised patients was 
performed. Before examinini the first table below (Table 3.), please note that the values 
listed for Cmax, AUC, Cl and Vd require adjustment --the values for Cmax and AUC can 
be determined by multiplying the table values by 0. 753. The values for Cl and Vd can be 
determined by dividing the table values by 0. 753. The values for Tmax, lambda,. and t112 do 
not require adjustment. The second table below ( Table 7.) is for phenytoin and no 
correction factor is required.

Using the corrected values, fosphenytoin clearance is more than 2-fold as great in 
cirrhosis patients and about 1.8-fold as great in renal failure patient£ than in healthy 
volunteers; however, it should be noted than the number of patients in each group of this 
study is small. Based on these data plasma concentration monitoring for patients with renal 
and hepatic di!!CaSe is recommended in labeling. 
Visual inspection of fosphenytoin concentration-time profiles docs not show 
differences across age, gender, race or any other sub-group. This is consistent with the fact 
that phosphatase activity is extensive and differences between individuals are likely to result 
in little or no difference in the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is consistent and essentially complete. 
There is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacokinetics due to differences in 
fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. 
17 Drug interactions .. 
Standard treatment for status epilepticus at many institutions includes concomitant 
administration of IV diazepam and IV phenytoin. Therefore, the sponsor penorrned a drug 
interaction study examining the eff~t of concomitant administration of fosphenytoin and 
diazepam on the phannacokinetic profiles of fosphenytoin, diazepam and phenytoin derived 
from fosphenytoin. No differencr.s in the kinetics of fosphenytoin, phenytoin or diazepam 
occurred. However, the doses of fosphenytoin and diazepam used in the study were 
submaximal: 750 mg of fosphenytoin was administered, labeling is for up to 20 mg/kg ( 
1400 mg in a 70 ki, individual ). Ten mg of diazepam was administered, labeling is for 
doses up to 30 mg. Thus, conditions likely to show an interaction ( maximium dose of both 
agents ) were not examined. 
The metabolism of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is accomplished by phosphatases. Since 
phosphatases are generally not responsible for xenobiotic drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic 
drug interactions between fosphenytoin and agents which are not phosphate pro-drugs are 
unlikely. Given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases, it is unlikely that drug 
interactions between fosphenytoin and other phosphatase-converted pro-drugs would be 
significant. 
IM administration 
Because phenytoin is not usually administered IM, fosphenytoin IM was compared to 
phenytoin PO and phenytoin IV. 
Average absolute bioavailability of phenytoin derived from a maintenance dose ( 25u 
mg ) of IM fosphenytoin administered to healthy volunteers is 101 % ( Study 98206 ). 
In epilepsy patients being maintained on PO Dilantin, substitution of equimolar IM 
fosphenytoin for PO Dilantin results in an increa.o;e in Cmax1,..,._,... ( 38% ). AUC1,..,....,..... 
( 24% ). and trough,.,.......,.... ( 16% ) ( study 98213 ). This observed increase in Cmax may 
be due to differences in dosing frequency: PO Dilantin was administered QID while IM 
fosphenytoin was given QD. 
Formulation 
Only one fosphenytoin formulation ( the to-be-marketed formulation ) was studied 
clinically.

Response to EIRs identified in 483 Fonns ... 
Following site inspections for the 98214, 98218 and 98224 studies, the Division of 
Scienti1ic Investigations issued multiple Form 483 to Parke-Davis. A review of the EIRs 
detailed in these 483 is provided as Appendix 5. We find that two of the EIRs need be 
addressed. The first is b~ntified as 1. in Appendix 5 and is reproduced below. 
1. Repor.ted fosphenytoin concentrations were in error since 
the water content of the fosphenytoin reference standard 
was not taken into account in calculations. 
The water content of the f osphenytoin sodium reference material 
was reported to be 22.5%. The salt form represented only 77.5% 
of the weight of the undried powder. The firm did not dry the 
powder on the grounds that the material was unstable with respect 
to heat. Therefore, the reported concentrations of fosphenytoin 
in plasma are in error, and need to be corrected. Similarly, 
some uf the derived pharmacokinetic parameters for fosphenytoin 
(Cmax, AUC, l':L, Vd) require correction. 
In response to the identification of this deficienry, Parke-Davis audited the NDA to 
determine if errors in tne r.alculation of fosphenytoin concentrations occured in studies other 
than 98214, 9S218 and 98224. A portion of their conclusions is presented on the following 
page. 
20 Parke Davis-gene1'Clled studies 
As noted in the October 19, 1995, submission, fosphcnytoin concenttations and 
estimates of fosphenytoin Cmax, AUC, CL and Vd in clinical trials conducted by 
Parke-Davis may be corrected by applying a correction factor of0.753. Fosphenytoin 
free fraction, tmax, elimination rate and half life estimates are unaffected as their 
estimation· does not depend on the absolute value of concenttations used in their 
derivation. Therefore, parameters documenting the rate of fospbenytoin conversion to 
phenytoin arc not affected. Further, phenytoin and free phenytoin concenttations, 
whether derived from Dilantin or fosphenytoin, are unaffected and thus the 
bioequivalency of fosphenytoin and phenytoin as presented in the pending NOA are not 
affected. 
Jtnerated srudies 
Our submission of October 19, 1995, indicated that we were attempting to determine if 
the fosphenytoin concentrations reported in the initial studies generated by 
were also in error. We have since determined that these concentrations in the 
clinical studies are most likely in error. We have determined the lot number and water 
content of fosphenytoin reference standard used in Protoeols 982-007 (renal and hepatic 
disease) and 982-011 (diazepam interaction). Our findings indicate that it is likely that 
fosphenytoin concenttations and parameters in these reportS can be corrected by 
applying the same correction factor used in Parke-Davis studies. Since these reports 
were prepared by _ we have not modified the original repons, but have added 
appropriate information to the cover page. Lot numbers, and thus the water content, of 
fosphenytoin reference ~tandards used in other studies cannot be unequivocally 
determined at this time. We have also added information identifying this potential 
problem to the cover pages of these reports. These early studies document phenytoin 
pharmacokinetics following low fosphenytoin doses (Studies 982-1,3), the absolute 
bioavailability of phenytoin following intravenous and inttamuscular fosphenytoin 
dosing (Studies 982-2,5,6, 10), the effects of hepatic and renal insufficiency on 
fosphenytoin conversion to phenytoin (Study 982-7), and a dia7.cpam.-phenytoin drug­
drug interaction study following fosphenytoin administration (Study 982-11). These 
studies are intended to address questions of rate and extent of fosphenytoin conversion 
to phenytein. Parameters used to reflect these processes (fosphenytoin half-life and 
phenytoin AUC, Cmax, and tmax) are unaffected. Therefore, the conclusions from 
these studies are not affected by our inability to accurately modify the fosphenytoin 
concentrations in these early studies. 
21 . . . The errors in fosphenytoin concentrations have NOT been accounted for in the 
1nd1V1d~ study repo.rts ( Appeddix 2 ). The values have little bearing on the interpretation 
of studies ~-the specie of clinical interest is generally plasma phenytoin, not plasma 
fosphenyto1n. 
The second EIR of significance is identified a,s 3. in Appendix S an<! is reproduced 
below. · 
3. Failure to use the appropriate matrix to prepare QC 
samples for validating stability in storage and reliability of the ultraf iltration step (assays of free 
phenytoin in plasma ultraf iltrate) and for validating stability in frozen urine. 
The assay for phenytoin in sample plasma ultraf iltrate included 
the following stages: frozen storage, thawing, possible 
refreezing and rett1awing, ul traf il tration, dilution, extraction, 
and chromatography. In the case of the QC samples, used both for 
validating stability in storage and monitoring daily performance 
of the assay, the stages of frozen storage, thawing, and 
freeze/thaw cycles were conducted after ultraf iltration, out of 
the sequence for study samples. Thus, the possibilities that 
phenytoin stability was different in PUF vs. plasma, that the 
binding proteins were unstable, and that the binding equilibria 
between free and protein-bound phenytoin disproportionated during 
frozen storage, thawing, or freeze/thaw cycles, were not 
investigated. The recovery of free phenytoin during the ultraf iltration stage was not established. The within-day and 
between-day variability of the ultrafiltration stage was not 
considered. The reproducibility of the ultrafiltration stage was 
not monitored during the assay of subject samples, because 
plasma-based QC samples were not ultrafiltered with each run. 
QC samples for the assay of phenytoin in PUF should have been 
prepared in fresh whole plasma. The firm replied that phenytoin 
stability in whole plasma was demonstrated, and contended that this established stability of phenytoin measul:ed in PUF. The 
co~siderations outlined in the previous par~graph (differences in 
stability, stability of binding proteins, disproportionation, 
recovery, ultrafiltration variability) were not addressed. There is literature cvi~epce that plasma proteins do not degrade with multiple 
freeze/thaw cycles, and there is also literature evidence that plasma phenytoin can be stored 
frozen for lengthy periods of time without degradation of phcnytoin. The NDA provides 
evidence that fosphenytoin is stable w'1en stored frozen in plasma. However, because of the 
improper handling of the standards, we cannot categorically rule out the possibility that 
differences in stability of fosphcnytoin, phenytoin and/or binding proteins, dLl occur between 
the samples assayed in studies 98214, 98218 and 98224. We believe that such differences 
likely did not occur, but this belief is not based upon empirical evidence from the studies 
themselves.

54 STUDY: A dose ranging tolmnce study ofCI-982 in healthy volynteers· A sjngle center study 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: 982-01 ( 9653-86-01 ) 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00024 
STUDY DESIGN: This was a single blind, dose-ranging study with randomized placebo control. 
The drug was administered by iv infusions over 30 minutes. The dose administered was: 150 mg 
(n=5), 300 mg (n=4), 600 mg (n = 4), and 1200 mg (n=3). The maximum infusion rate was 40 
mg/min. Dlood was sampled up to 72 hours after the initiation of the infusion. 
DOSAGE FORM: See Formulation Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. 
SAFETY F -: SUL TS: No adverse experiences were reported at the 300 and 600 mg dose. Minor 
CNS adverse reactions including lightheadedness, headache and nystagmus were reported at the 
600 and 1200 mg doses. None of the subjects prematurely discontinued the study. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The phannacokinetic results are summarized in Table 1 
below. Fosphenytoin was rapidly converted to phenytoin with a half-life of approximately 7.7 
minutes. Fosphenytoin appeared to display linear kinctic.i in this concentration range. This 
result is consistent with later studies because the highest dosage in this study (1200 mg 
fosphenytoin at a rate of 40 mg/min= 800 mg phenytoin equivalents at a rate of27 mg/mL) is 
lower than the dosages at which nonlinearities have been observed. Phenytoin kinetics were 
consistent with those previously reported. Thus, at the relatively low doses used in this study it 
does not appear that fosphenytoin has a large effect on phenytoir. phannacokinetics. Subtle 
changes in phenytoin phannacokinetics would not have been Jeie<.ted in this type of study. 
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy vo!unterrs, fosphenytcin is safely administered at the highest level 
studied (1200 mg given over 30 minutes). It is rapidly collvtrted to phenytoin.

healthy male volunteers 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: 982-02 ( 9653-86-02 ) 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00025 
STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, open-label, two treatment crossover. The 250 mg 
phenytoin and 375 mg fosphenytoin doses were administered by iv infusions over 30 minutes. 
Twenty six blood samples w~e obtained per treatment up to 120 hours after drug infusion. Total 
drug concentration in the pllwna was measured at all time points, total concentration in th" blood 
was measured at six of the .:ollection times points, and unbound concentration in the plasma was 
measured at two time points ( at the end ofthe infusion and 30 minutes after the end of the 
infusion). Treatments were separated by two weeks. 
SUBJECTS: Healthy male volunteers ( n=l2 ). 
DOSAGE FORM: See Formulation Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical MethodJ Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti· 
coagulant in this study, and the temperature at which ultrafiltration was performed is not clear 
from the study report. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions were observed in this study. Fosphenytoin 
injection caused less injection site irritation than did phenytoin injection. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The bioavailability of phenytoin after iv fosphenytoin 
administration compared to after iv phenytoin administration was 99.2% ± 0.031 (because of the 
low variability the two dosages are actually bioequivalent in terms of AUC; Table 3 ). The 
concentration time profiles were similar but not superimposable at early time points (Figure l }. 
The unbm.:nd fraction of phenytoin was highest immediately after the fosphenytoin infusion ( 
Table l, this result is consistent with fosphenytoin displacing phenytoin from plasma proteins. 
The effect is quite small because of the relatively small fosphenytoin dose used in this study). 
The blood to plasma ratio for fosphenytoin was approximately 0. 5 for 5 of the six time points 
measured ( Table 2 ). At the latest time point ( 3 hr ) the ratio ·:ncreased to approximately 2. 
This unexpected result is likely due to analytical errors caused by the ve1]' low fosphenytoin 
concentrations at this time point. As described in the analytical section above, the results of this 
part of the study are in question due to the use of heparin as the anticoaguiant. 
Bioavailability would have been better determined by a comparison of unbound AUCs 
instead of total AU Cs. This is because bioavailability calculations are based on the assumption 
that clearance does not ~iffer in the two treatments that are being compared. In this case, 
fosphenytoin can displar.e phenytoin from plasma proteins thereby increasing fu and total 
phenytoin clearance. Unbound clearance would not have been affected by this phenomenon and 
thus unbound AUC comparison would have been a better measure ofbioavailability. However, 
because fosphenytoin is relatively short-lived in the plasma, and because the fu of phenytoin was 
only increa~ by approximately I% due to fosphenytoin this effect should have had only a very 
Si small influence on phenytoin AtJC. The fact that the phenytoin concentration/time profiles were 
very similar for most of the time period also helps suppon the validity of the bioavailability 
conclusions made in this study. 
CONCLUSIONS: Fosphenytoin is completely convened to phenytoin after intravenous 
administration. Fosphenytoin does not significantly distribute into red blood cells.

coagulant in Study 98205. EDTA was used as an anti-coagulant and ultrafiltration performed 
at J7° C in Study 98213. 
SAFETY RESULTS: 98205 --Parenteral fosphenytoin was well tolerated by the 
patients. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, 
neurological status ( except nystagmus ), and the electrocardiogram were observed following 
either IM or IV treatment. 
98213 -There were no clinically significant differences in the 
type and frequency of adverse events between fosphenytoin·and Dilantin treatment groups, 
and the adverse event profile was similar to that expected with phenytoin therapy. PHARMACOKINETIC REStJLTS: 98205 (single dose fosphenytoin) --The data 
are presented on the following 3 pages ( Figures 1 and 2; Table 1 ), and show that, as 
expected, IV administration produces a steeper rise in the concentration time profile than IM 
administration. 
98213 ( multiple dose fosphenytoin) --The data 
are presented on pp/JS-b~ Figure 3, Table 2 ). For at least the first 4 hrs post­
administration, free concentrations of phenytoin following IM fosphenytoin administration are 
considerably greater than those following PO Dilantin administration ( Figure 3 ). This is 
consistent with a protein binding interaction: when fosphenytoin is present phenytoin is 
displaced and free phenytoin concentrations increase. It is also coHsistent with the total 
phenytoin data: total phenytoin is more bioavailable from IM fosphenytoin than from PO 
Dilantin ( Figure 3, Table 2 ). This increase in total phenytoin concentrations results in the 
increased free phenytoin concentrations noted.

. CONCLUSIONS: Substitutit>rt of equimolar IM fosphenytoin for PO Dilantin results in an 
increase in Cmax,,.._,_ ( 38% ) and AUC:,,..- ( 24%) (study 98213 ). The increase 
in Cmax may be due to differences in closing frequency: PO Dilantin was administered QID 
while IM fosphenytoin was given QD. 
The effect of substitution of IV fosphenytoin for PO Dilantin on Cmax of free 
phenytoin can be inferred. IM administration of fosphenytoin results in higher Cma.x,-,..;. 
than PO administration of phenytoin, and IV administration ;,f fosphenytoin results in higher 
Cmax,...,... than IM administration of fosphenytoin. Thus, IV administration of fosphenytoin 
is likely produces an even greater increase in Cma.x,....,- than does IM administration of 
fosphenytoin. This increase in Cmax,,i....- would be expected to result in an increase in 
Cmax,__. Also, IV administration results in greater Cmax1 ,. ,_than does IM 
administration. Based upon this increased plasma fosphenytoin causing displacemen~ of 
phenytoin protein binding, Cmax,,.. p11ca,_ should be higher following IV administration of

STIJDY NUMBER: 982-06 (9653-86-06) 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00028 
STIJDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, open-!abei two treatment crossover. Fosphenytoin ( 
250 mg ) was injected into the gluteus maximus muscle over approximately 30 seconds. Six 
volunteers received 2 simultaneous 2.5 mL injections and 6 volunteers received a single 5 mL 
injection. Phenytoin ( 250 mg ) was administered via an iv infusion over 10 minutes. Twenty six 
blood samples were obtained per treatment up to 120 hours after drug infusion. Only total 
fosphenytoin and phenytoin concentrations in the plasma was measured. Treatments were 
separated by two weeks. 
SUBJECTS: Healthy male volunteers (n=l2). 
DOSAGE FORM: See Formulation Summary: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytica! Mi,ithods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagularit in this study. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions were observed in this study. IM fosphenytoin 
injection caused less injection site irritation than did IV phenytoin injection. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic results of this study are summarized 
in Tables I · 3. The plasma concentration time curves for phenytoin and fosphenytoin are given 
in Figures 1 -3. The elimination half-life for fosphenytoin after IM injection averaged 44 
minutes ( Table I ), considerably longer that the I 5 minute half-life typically observed after IV 
fosphenytoin injection. This result suggests that flip-flop kinetics are occurring (i.e. terminal 
rate reflects absorption from muscle tissue ). The Cmax was higher and the Tmax was earlier 
when the dose was administered by 2 IM injections compared to a single IM injection { Table 3 
). 
The bioavailability of phenytoin from IM fosphenytoin (compared to IV phenytoin) was 
101.2 :!: 1.6% (Table 2 ). Bioavailability was not affected by whether the drug was given as one 
or two injections, although the rate of absorption was faster after two injections ( Table 3 ). Not 
surprisingly, phenytoin Cmax was lower and the Tmax was later after IM fosphenytoin injection 
compared to IV phenytoin infusion ( Table 2, Figure 2 ). 
CONCLUSION: Fosphenytoin is completely converted to phenytoin after intramuscular 
injection. Fosphenyt.oin absorption from muscle is fairly smooth and appears to follow simple 
first order kinetics with a half-life of approximately 0. 75 hr. Thus, IM fosphenytoin appears to 
be a reasonable form of maintenance therapy.

STUDY DE.SIGN: Single center, open label study with screening, baseline, treatment, and 
poststudy periods. F.ach individual received 250 mg phenytOin equivalents of fo~phenytoin 
IV administered over 30 min. It should be noted that the protocol allowed patients to 
continue ongoing therapy during the trial. Documentation of ongoing therapy was not 
provided.

Values in the above table are mean + SEM. Renal failure patients required 
maintenance hcmodialysis, hepatic patients had: 1. liver biopsy evidence of cirrhosis, 2. a 
total serum bilirubin level less than 4 mg%, 3. a creatinine clearance rate of at least 60 ml I 
min. DOSAGE FORM: see Focuwlation Summary: Appendix 3 
ASSAY: see Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. 
PROTOCOL VARIATIONS: Volunteers' #1 ( healthy ) and #2 ( healthy ) plasma sample 
extracts were incorrectly processed and therefore omitted. Volunteer #7 ( renal failure ) was 
also omitted due to "ChromatographiC interferences". Volunteer #13 received only a 24 
minute infusion, and was therefore not included in Cmax or Tmax analyses. Volunteers #4 ( 
hepatic ), #12 ( renal ), #13 ( renal ), and #14 ( renal ), received modified, or no, treatment 
with their ongoing concomitant therapies. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No adverse clinical events were reported and no clinically significant 
changes were observed in the physical examinations, clinical laboratory parameters, clinical 
observations, or electrocardiograms. 
PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Demographic infonnation was summarized for each group 
(renal, hepatic, and hepatic) separately. Differences among 
groups were assessed using a one-way ANOVA model for 
continuous data a11d Fisher's Exact Text for categorical 
data. 
77 ~. 
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmaxl and the time of the 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmaxl were detennined by 
observation. 
The terminal or •apparent" disposition rate constant (.l.nl 
was calculated as the slope of the tenninal portion of t~e 
log-linear plasma concentration versus time curve. 
The terminal or "apparent" disposition half-life (t112l was 
calculated by: 
ln 2 
t112 .. 
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 
(AUCo-l was calculated by the trapezoidal rule up to the 
last quantifiable concentration (AUCo+Tl plus the residual 
area calculated as the ratio of the final plasma 
concentration divided by .l.n.

p < 0.05 ) is not reached in nearly all of the comparisons made above. However, the null 
hypothesis of no difference is inappropriate as differences would be expected based upon the 
protein binding nature of the drug and decreases in plasma protein which accompany rer,al 
and hepatic diseases. The study is insufficiently powered ( 3 - 4 in each group ) to allow for 
the chosen statistical approach to be utilized, and trends. are clearly observable. 
CONCLUSIONS: The dose of fosr-henytoin administered in this study was 250 mg 
phenytoin equivalents at 8.33 mg equivalents I min.. The sponsor has labeled the drug for 
administration at doses as large as 20 mg/kg at 150 mg/min. Clearly, the study fails to 
encompass the condition where changes in drug disposition are most easily observed and 
most clinically serious: following high dose and rate of administration. Further, free 
phenytoin concentrations were not measured in the study. Since free phenytoin is the specie 
of interest, and serum protein concentrations are altered by renal and hepatic disease ( as 
would be expected these alterations were seen in the current study --see Table on p. ), 
this severely limits the ability to interpret the effect of renal and hepatic disease on the 
disposition of free phenytoin from fosphenytoin. 
Fosphenytoir1 clearance is more than 2-fold greater in cirrhosis patients than in healthy 
volunteers, and over 1.5-fold greater in renal failure patients.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a randol'l'jzed, open-label study in epileptic patients on chronic oral 
phenytoin monutherapy. At separate injection sites in the same arm, each patient received 128 
mg phenytoin equivalents of labelled fosphenytoin and 130 mg phenytoin equivalents of!abelled 
phenytoin simultaneously. Blood was sampled at 25 time points up to 96 hours after drug 
administration. Urine was collected just prior to the infusions and from O -1, 1 -24, 24 -48, 48 
-72 ..ad 72 -96 hours. Labelled and unlabeled phenytoin and fosphenytoin concentrations were 
measured in the plasma and urine via satisfactory HPLC and GCIMS methodologies. The 
phenytoin metabolite S-( 4-hydro;cyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) was also measured in 
the urine. 
SUBJECTS: Epileptic males on chronic oral pbenytoin monotherapy (n=6}. 
DOSAGE FORM: 13C-labelled fosphenytoin disodium (229.4 mg/3.2 mL, Lot #Z88-5-5) and 
"N-uc labelled phenytoi.-: sodium (189.9 mg/3.2 mL. Lot #Z88-5-5). see also Formulation 
Summarv: Appendix 3. 
ASSAY: See Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. 
SAFETY RESULTS: No major adverse reactions v.er~ c>!>served in this study. 
PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic results of this study are summarized 
in Tables I -2. The pharmacokinetic parhllleters determined in these patients are very consistent 
with what was found in healthy volunteers. The AUC ratio of uC-phenytoin/1'N-uC-phenytoin 
(i.e. AUC of phenytoin from fosphenytoin injection divided by Al.JC of phenytoin from 
phenytoin injection) was 0.96 with a 95% confidence interval for bioequivalence being 0.92 to 
1.00. Thus, the bioavailability offosphenytoin is virtually unity. 
No fosphenytoin was detected in the urine. However, slightly more p~enytoin was 
detected in the urine during the first I hour after fosphenytoin administration compared to after 
phenytoin adrn:nistration ( Table 3 ). This indicates that it is possible that a very small amount 
of fosphenytoin ( approximately I o/o of the dose ) may be exc:eted in the urine, where it is 
subsequently hydrolyzed to phenytoin. The recovery ofp-HPPH was higher aft.,, phenytoin 
administration than after fosphenytoin administration ( Table 2 ), but trus diifert nee was small 
and not statistically significant. 
CONCLUSION: This was an excellent m«1thod for determining bi<>avai!ability because 
intrasubject variability was completely eliminated. An intravenous dose of fospitenytoin was 
virtually completely convened to phenytoin in patients who were on chronic oral phenytoin 
therapy.

RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 744-00031. 
STUDY DESIGN: single center, randomized, nonblind, 3-way crossover study in healthy 
males. Solutions were infused undiluted by Harvard Syringe Pumps into indwelling catheters 
in the same arm. Treatments were separated by at least 13 days. The treatments were: 
A) fosphenytoin ( 750 mg at 50 mg I min ) 
B) diazepam ( 10 mg/2 ml/5 min ) followed 10 minutes later by fosphenytoin ( 750 
mgat50mg/min) 
C) diazepam ( 10 mg/2 ml/5 min) 
SUBJECTS: The values below arc approximate --11 individuals entered the study, but only

DOSAGE FOR.M: see Fonnulation Summary: Appendix 3 
ASSAY: see Analytical Methods Summary: Appendix 4. Heparin was used as an anti­
coagulant in this study. Free fractions were determined by spiking y•ith radiolabel and 
ultracentrifugation was perfonned at room temperature. 
PROTOCOL VARIATICJNS: There were no protocol vmations. There were 2 dropouts. 
Subject #6 withdrew from the study after completing his first treatment ( treatment B -­
diazepam and fosphenytoin ) following diagnosis of underlying borderline hypenension by 
hispersonal '>hysician. Subject #10 was withdrawn from the study after participating in 
88 treatments B and A ( treatlllfllt B -diazepam and fosphenytoin and treatment A -­
fosphenytoin alone ) because of a vasovagal episode during treatment A. Subjects 6 and 10 
were included in the safety analysis but not in PK analysis. 
SAFETY RESULTS: One subject ( #10) experienced a vasovagal syncopal episode which 
included hypotension and bradycardia during Treatment A ( fosphenytoin alone ) . These 
events required discontinuation of the study drug. This subject had previously completed 
treatment B ( diazeparn and fosphenytoin ) without significant effects on heart rate, EC<.: 
intervals, or blood pressure. Follow-up evaluation of this episode, which included a 24 hour 
Holter monitor recording and a more extensive medical history, n:vealed no cardiologic 
abnormalities, but did detail a previously unreported episode of syncope during an 
intravenous drug study. In the investigator's clinical judgement, this episode was therefore 
related to the intravenous infusion but not to fosphenytoin. Ten of the 11 subjects who 
entered the study reported adverse clinical events in at least one treatment phase. These 
events are summarized below.

0 c; CONCLUSIONS: Co-administartion of fosphenytoin ( 7SO mg/IS ml/IS min ) and diazepam 
( lO mg/2 ml/S min ) resurre8 in plasma concentrations of fosphenytoin, phenytoin and 
diazepam similar to those observed when fosphenytoin or diazepam was administered alone. 
It should be noted that fosphenytoin was not administered at maximum dose and rate. The 
sponsor's labeling of fosphenytoin allows for doses up to 20 mg/lcg ( in a 70 kg individual 
this equals 1400 mg) and rates up to 22S mg/min. Th~ the dose was approximately SO% 
of the labeled maximum, and the rate was approximately 2S% of the labeled maximum. 
Similarly, Valium was not administered at maximum dose. The dose of Valium used was 
only 33% of the labeled maximum of 30 mg. Thus, conditions which have the greatest 
potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction ( maximum dose and rate of 
both co-administered agents ) were not addressed in the study. ~ --. RR 7 44-00086 iv

SYNOPSIS 
I.lllf A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RISING SINGLE­
DOSE STUDY OF THE PHARMACOKINETIC AND TOLERANCE PROFILES OF INTRAVENOUS 
FOSPHENYTOIN SODIUM (Cl-982) ADHINISTEREO AT·FIVE DIFFERENT INFUSION 
RATES TO HEALTHY SUBJECTS (PROTOCOL 982-18-0) 
INVESTIGATOR 
Cl-982 ANALYSTCSl 
OBJECTIVES To evaluate, in healthy subjects, the safety and tolerance 
of escalating sitgle doses and infusion rates of intravenously (IV) 
administered fosphenytoin compared with placebo and to define the 
pharmacokinetics of fosphenytoin and phenytoin following IV 
administration of fosphenytoin 
STUDY DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way 
crossover, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic study 
DRUG TREATMENT Following a randomized, four-way crossover design, 
subjects received single IV infusion doses of fosphenytoin or placebo at 
weekly intervals. The first group received 600, 1200, or 1800 mg 
fosphenytoin at 18.75 mg/min (equivalent to 400, 800, or 1200 mg 
phenytoin at 12.5 mg phenytoin/min) or placebo (identical volume of 
fosphenytoin vehicle administered at the same rate as the fosphenytoin 
dose). Subsequent groups received these saMe doses of fosphenytoin and 
placebo at 37.5, 75, 150, and 225 mg/min (equivalent to 25, 50, 100, and 
150 mg phenytoin/min). Escalation to the next dose and/or infusion rate 
was contingent on the absence of significant adverse events at the 
previous dose or rate. 
SUBJECT CHABACTERlSTICS ANQ QISPOSITIQH Twenty-one men ranging in age 
from 19 to 43 years (mean 26) participated in this study. Twenty 
subjects completed the study; one subject withdrew &or personal reasons. 
PHARMACOKINEJltS In general, fosphenytoin plasma concentration~ 
increased with dose and infusion rate, peaked near the end of infusion, 
ar.d then declined with a t\ of approximattly 0.25 hour. Mean 
fosphenytoin AUC(O-... ) values decreased with increasing infusion rate; 
but increased with increasing dose, although less than expected for a 
drug with linear pharmacoklnetlcs. Wh~n higher plasma fosphenytoin 
concentrations were achieved with increasing infusion rates, more free 
fosphenytoin was available for conversion to phenytoin resulting in 
increased fosphenytoin clearance. 
Tota 1 phenytoin and free phenytoin pharmacoki net ics were nonlinear. 
Mean total phenytoin Cmax ~alues increased \p~roximately proportionally 
with incr~ases in dose. AUC(O-... ) values increased at a greater than 
dose-prr.portional rate; mean AUC(O-•' values increased approximately 
O:\Cl.C\RR\7440008e.A 97 4 Of ~ 
284~9 CERE9YX RR 744-00086 v 
..... 
five-fold over the three-fold rar.ge of doses. While Cmax and AUC(O-..,) 
values increased with dose, they did not increase with increased rates, 
providing further evidence that extent of fosphenytoin conversion to 
phenytoin was independent of fosphenytoi.n infusion rate. 
Fosphenytoin displaced phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites 
resulting in a phenytoin free fraction that increased with increasing 
plasma fosphenytoin concentration. Displacement was greatest after 
administration of 1200 mg phenytoin equivalents fosphenytoin, leading to 
increases in phenytoin free fraction during the first hour after the 
start of infusion. During the first hour, similar free phenytoin Cmax 
values were seen at 12.E to 50 mg phenytoin equivalents/min, whereas 
higher free phenytoin Cmax values temporally related to increased free 
fraction were observed at 100 and 150 mg :,he:>'ttoin equivalents/min. 
Following conversion of fosphenytoin to phu~ytoin, free fraction, and 
plasma free phenytoin concentrations were siMilar at all infusion rates. 
Free phenytoin concentration-time profiles after administration of 
1200 mg phenytoin equivalents fosphenytoin at the two highest rates were 
similar to those historically observed following administration of 
1200 mg Dilantin at 50 mg/min. 
Renal phenytoin and free phenytoin clearances were independent of dose 
and infusion rate. Less than 2% of dose was excreted as phenytoin. 
Thus, transient alterations in phenytoin free fraction did not affect 
overall renal clearance of phenytoin. 
SAF[;TY Over a 11, 8~ of fosphenytoi n-treated subjects experien;. ·:.~ 
adverse bYents compared with 15% of placebo-treated subjects. A total 
of 220 adverse events occurred following fosphenytoin treatment; most 
were mild in intensity and attributed to drug treatment. In general, 
the overall frequency of adverse events increased with fosphenytoin 
dose. Dizziness was the most frequently reported adverse event 
following fosphenytoin treatment. Other than mild nystagmus observed at 
800 and 1200 mg phenytoin equi\•alents of fosphenytoin, significant drug­
related changes were not observed in clinical laboratory parameters, 
physical examinations, electrocardiograms, or vital signs. No deaths or 
serious adverse events occurred, and no subject withdrew from the study 
as the result of an adverse event. 
CONCLUSIONS Fosphenytoin is rapidly converted to phenytoin; rate and 
extent of conversion ~re independent of dose and infusion rate. 
Fosphenytoin displaces phenytoin from plasma proteins, especially at 
infusion rates greater than SO mg phenytoin equivalents/min, resulting 
:n increased free phenytoin c:oncentrations for approximately 30 minutes 
after the start of infusion. Free phenytoin concentration-time profiles 
similar to those of parenteral phenytoin can be obtained by selecting 
the proper fosphenytoin infusion rate. Fosphenytoin doses of 400 to 
1200 mg phenytoin equivalents at r~tes of 25 to 150 mg phenytoin 
equivalents/min are acceptably tolerated. However, as with Dilantin and 
other antiepileptic drugs, dizziness, paresthesia, and other CNS 
symptoms are often reported.

concenuadons generally occurred 30 minutes eadict than mmma! total phenytoin 
conccotralions. Despite disp.lacement of pheaytoin from plapn• pmte:i.Ds by 
fnsphenytoin, mean free phcmytoin Cmax following fosphmytoin was 35 $ less than 
that following Dilantin, with the mean marimum dift'ereace occuning at the eud of 
infusion. After conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin, plasma free phenytoin 
c:oncmtrations we.re similar for both treatmalts. At a molar cquivalmt dose and ratt 
compacable tire and total phenytoiu AUC values were oblahled following 
... fosphenytoiD and Dilantin. 
SAFETY The natu1'e and fnquency of advenc events we.re similar after fosphen)'tl 
and Dilantin; few adverse events occurred following placebo. The most frequent 
adverse events aft.er fosphenytoin and Dil•DtiJI ~ nystagmus, djzzjMSs, and 
tinnitus. Injection-site symproms (inflammation, pain, and reaction) we.re experieni 
by fewer subjects following fosphenytoin (33$) than DiJantin (839'). There were 
dealhs, serious advene events, or withdrawals due to advene events. No clinicaD 
significant changes occum:d in clinical laboratoiy parameters, physical examjnario 
electrocanliognuns, or vital signs. -
CONCLUSIONS A molar equivaleot dose of fosphenytoiD administeml at SO m 
pbcnytoin equivalents/min produces comparable free and total phenytoin AUC .a 
but slightly lower and delayed maximal free and total pheaytoin conc:enuatioDs

OBJECTIVE To com~ the phannacoldnetics of phenytoin following single doaes 
of intravenously administeted fosphenytoin and Dilantin, and to evaluate the safety 
and tolerance of fosphenytoin compued with Dilantin and p~ 
STIJDY DESIGN Randomized, double-bliod, 3-way crossover, pbarmacokinetic and 
tolerance study 
DRUG TREATMENT :Each subject received 1200 mg DUanrin, a molar equivalent 
dose of fosphenytoin, and placebo; each trealment was sepuated by a I-week washout 
period. Fosphenytoin was infused at 50 mg phenytoin equivalentslmin (TS mg/min) 
and Dilantin at 50 mg/min. Subjects were randomized so that only 2 subjects 
received each treatment (fospbenytoin, Dilantin, or placebo) at any one time. 
SUBJECT CBARACTERISTICS AND DISPOSmON Twelve men ranging in age 
. from 18 to 49 years (median 30) entered and completed this study. 
PBARMACO.KlNE'llCS .Plasma fospbenytoin, total pbenytoin, and free pbenytoin 
CODCelltruions were quantified using validated liquid chromatographic methods. 
Plasma fosphenytoin concentrations peaked near the end of the infusion. Rapid 
conversion of fospbeaytoin to pbenytoin was apparent from the short mean 
fospbenytoin tV.Z value of 0.29 hour. For the first hour after dOsing, total pbenytoin 
concentntimb iollowillg fosphenytoin were lower than those following Dilllltin due to 
the time required· for conversion of fospbenytoin to pbenytoin. Mean pbenytoin 
A UC(o-tJdc) values followillg fospbenytoin were approximately 8 S less than those 
following Dilantin, probably due to differmces in total phenytoin c:learance as a 
function of plasma pbenytoin concentration rather than incomplete conversion of 
fospbenytoio to pbenytoin. 
Free pbenytoin tmax values after fospbenytoin were influenced by fospbenytoio 
displac:c:oent of pbenytoin from plasma proteins as maximal free phenytoin

'.30 The above figures ue~$trate that, at the 150 mg/min rate of fosphenytoin, AUC of 
free phenytoin from fosphcnytoin reaches that of free phenytoin from Dilantin at 
approximately 8 min. post-start-of-infusion., rises above that of Dilantin, and then falls to be 
approximately equal to that of Dilantin within 30 minutes post-start-of-infusion. This 
approximate equality is then maintained over the remainder of the time course. At 100 
mg/min fosphenytoin, cumulative AUC of free phenytoin takes approximately 1.5 hrs. to 
reach the 80 -125 % band. · 
As forementioned, the cumulative AUC from fosphenytoin is greater than that from 
Dilan tin for approximately 10 -20 minutes. However, examination of the concentration-time 
profiles ( Panel D --page IJ7) shows that the reason for the increased AUC is because 
fosphcnytoin delivers free phcnytoin more rapidly than Dilantin, and not because Cmax is 
increased. An additional point is that the differences in cumulative AUC between the 100 
and 150 mg rates is due to the first 15 minutes post-initiation-of-infusion. From that point 
onward, the differences between the 100 and 150 mg/min infusion rates are minimal. 
These analysis' show that, at 100 -ISO mg/min, free phenytoin from fosphenytoin 
closely approximates, but docs not duplicate, free phenytoin from Dilantin at 50 mg/min. 
CONCLUSIONS: The concentration-time profile of free phenytoin from 1200 mg of 
fosphenytoin administered at 100 or 150 mg/min is comparable to that following 1200 mg of 
phcnytoin administered at 50 mg/min. The 150 mg/min rate meets equivalence criteria for 
Cmax and AUC, whereas the 100 mg/min rate meets criteria for AUC oniy. 
If cumulative AUC is examined, the 150 mg/min rate meets equivalence criteria from 
30 minutes onward, the 100 mg/min rate from 90 minutes onward. At time periods longer 
than 90 minutes the A UC of free phenytoin from fosphcnytoin at either administration rate 
are equivalent to free phenytoin from 50 mg/min Dilantin. 
'31 STUDY: Pharmacpkjnetic meta Malysjs of fosoheoytpjn clinical trials ... .. . 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR-X 764-02114 
OBJECTIVE: To compare systemic exposure of phenytoin, 11 after dosing fosphenytoin and 
Dilantin•, 2) between patients and healthy subjects, 3) between arterial and venous phenytoin, 
and 4) the effects of age, gender, and race on the pharmacoki11etic profiie of fosphenytoin. 
STIJDY DESIGN: The data from clinical studies 982-13 to 982-16 and healthy volunteer 
studies 982-18, 982-20 and 982-24 were utilized. 
1) Phenytoin population phannacokinctics was carried out using a nonlinear mixed effect 
model to evaluate the effects of dosing regimen, body weight, time, age, gender, and serum 
albu1ain concentration on phenytoin clearance and distribution in a linear pharmacolcinetic 
model. The studies 982-14 and 982-15 used in the analysis were from routine therapeutic 
drug monitoring. Only samples collected more than 6 hours 11..fter fospbenytoin administration 
were used (to avoid cross reactivity with immunoassay). 
2) Graphical analysis of patient/subject differences were made by subsetting free phenytoin, 
total phenytoin and fosphenytoin concentralion time profiles by dose and infusion rate and 
visually inspecting for patterns and/or differences among patients and hr.althy subjects. All 
the above studies were included. 
3) Comparison of arterial and venous plasma concentrations for fo~phenytoin, total phenytoin 
and free phenytoin were made in 6 neurosurgery patients. Plots were visually inspected for 
trends. 
4) Patient sub-populations were graphically analyzed by subsetting plasma concentration 
profiles by route of administration and then further subsetting by age, gender, and race and 
visually inspecting for patterns and/or differences among patients. 
RESULTS: 
1) A linear phannacolcin~c modcl served as a suitable alternative to the generally applicable 
non-linear model given the restrictions in the range of doses and pl~ma phenytoin 
concentrations available from these clinical trials. 
Consistent with previous clinical experience, phenytoin clearance and volume of 
distribution exhibit a direct relationship with weight. Mean trough phenytoin levels decline 
over time (Fig 1) and this is also reflected in the individual. plots (Fig 2). Modeling suggests 
this decline in mean plasma phenytoin concentration i~ most likely explained in terms of an 
increase in phenytoin clearance in those patients remaining in the studies for more than just a 
few days rather than a tendency for patients with intrinsically high clearance to remain in the 
study longer (Fig 2 and Bayes estimates). 
Modeling for difference in extent of systemic availability suggests that fosphenytoin 
delivers 15 9' less phenytoin than Dilantin, however, this may be due to model 
misspecification uf the i. m. dosage. 
2) Graphical presentation of free phenytoin, total phenytoin, and fosphenytoin concentration­
time profiles by dose/infusion rate does not suggest the presence of sub-populations or 
specific individuals for which these levels are atypical. 
3) Graphical comparison of plasma arterial and venous concentration time profiles for free 
phenytoin, total phenytoin and fosphenytoin do not shew any differences. ... 
4) Graphical analysis of patie!nt sub-populations did not suggest the presence of 
sub-populations or specific individuals for which fosphenytoin concentration time profiles 
were atypical (Fig 3). 
CONCLUSIONS: The observed trend for concentrations to drop within individuals suggests 
a time dependent increase in clearance in phenytoirt clearance which has been observed 
previously in febrile patients and trauma patients. This does not appear to be related to 
fosphenytoin administration. The observation that intravenous fosphenytoin is 15 % less 
bioavailable than Dilantin is not of concern bccau~-the improved fit of the data to the model 
including this bioavailability term is moderate. No further unusual trends where observed. 
Visual inspection of plasma arterial and venous concentration-time profiles for 
fosphenytoin show no obvious differences which is consistent with the fact that phcnytoin is a 
low extraction ratio drug. 
Visual inspection of fosphenytoin concentration time profiles does not show any 
apparent differences across age, gender, race or in any of the sub-groups. This is consistent 
with the fact that phosphatase activity is extensive and differences in individuals is unlikely to 
make much difference in the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
The conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin is consistent and essentially complete. 
There is no evidence of atypical phenytoin pharmacok.inetics due to differences in 
fosphenytoin disposition between individuals. RR-X 764-0211'° 28

STUDY: Characterization offo5pheovtoin and pbenvtojn human plasma pmtejn binding jn vitro 
RESEARCH REPORT NUMBER: RR 764-02124 
OBJECTIVES: To determine the protein binding characteristics of fosphenytoin and phenytoin 
using standard in vitro methodologies. 
STUDY DESIGN: Plasma samples were spiked with fosphenytoin (up to 800 µglmL) and 
phenytoin ( up to 80 µglmL ) and total and unbound drug ceincentrations were determined via 
ultrafiltration and HPLC. NONMEM was used to fit the data to a variety ofbjnding models. 
RESULTS: The following pertinent conclusions can be made (see Figures 1 • S ): 
l. F osphenytoin binding is best described by a model which incorporates 2 saturable binding 
sites. F osphenytoin binds to the site of highest affinity with a binding constant of approximately 
I. I µglmL, suggesting that this is the approximate unbound plasma concentration above which 
nonlinear binding may be observed. The second site has a much lower affinity ( Kd > I 00 µglmL 
) suggesting that binding at this site will b"' linear at typical in vivo plasma fosphenytoin 
::oncentrations. 
2. Phenytoin binding is best described by a model which incorporates 1 saturable binding site 
and I linear binding site. The affinity constant for the saturable binding site is approximately 30 
µglmL. 
3. r· osphenytoin ( at free con~entrations above approximately 1. O µglmL or total concentrations 
above approximately 75 µg/mL ) is capable of displacing phenytoin from the high affinity 
binding sights whereas phenytoin ( at total concentrations below 80 µg/mL ) docs not 
significantly displace fosphenytoin. 
4. These results are qualitatively consistent with the results of in vivo studies. However, 
quantitatively there are some inconsistencies. These inconsistencies are likely due to 
deficiencies in the in vivo studies ( including the performance of ultrafiltration at non­
physiological temperatures, the use of heparin as the anticoagulant, and the use of contaminated 
radiolabeled drugs ).

Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products 
At the request of HFD-120, the Division of Scientific 
Investigations initiated audits of three pharmacokinetics and 
bioequivalency studies. These audits were expedited due to the 
User Fee status of this NOA. 
The clinical portion of study 982-014 was performed at the 
University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN. The clinical portions of 
studies 982-018 and 982-024 were performed a 
The analytical portions of all three 
studies were performed at I 
the inspections, Forms 483 (attached) were issued. 
evaluation of these findings is as follows: Following 
Our 
1. Reported fosphenytoin concentrations were in error since 
the water content of the fospher.ytoin reference standard 
was not taken into account in calculations.

protein-binding, unbound phenytoin, and percentage unbound 
phenytoin, be reviewed for corroboration independent of the data 
evaluated here. 
In light ot the nonlinear kinetics ·for fosphenytoin and 
phenytoin, a dosing error up to 5' combined with analytical errors up to 10' may need to be considered when interpreting 
pharmacokinetics. 
After you have reviewed the material, we request that this 
transmittal memo be appended to the original NOA submission.

Insufficient information is provided regarding the test 
methods for water solubility and partition coefficient. 
DEFICIENT. For water solubility informa.tion such as the 
methodology used (e.g., undersaturation/oversatc;ration), the 
study site, the temperature at which the solubility was 
determined and the HPLC method should be provided. For the 
partition coefficient information such a.s the test 
methodology, the study site, concentration at which the 
study was performed ( 2 different ones net!ded) and the HPLC 
method should be provided. 
Although not necessary, the photolytic degradation of 
Fosphenytoin Sodium was determined. The conclusion (page 
17, 1st sentence in second paragraphl should be revised to 
indicate that photolysis is not a primary removal mechanism 
of Fosphenytoin Sodium from the environment. DEFICIENT. 
Fosphenytoin Sodium is aerobically biodegraded in the 
aquatic·compartment to Phenytoin. Phenytoin does not 
biodegrade in the aquatic compartment and does not to absorb 
~o soil. The company states that Hydroxyphenytoin 
aerobically biodegrades rapidly in the aquatic compartment 
and that jt has been proven/demonstrated to completely 
degrade to co,. The data provided does not support these 
statements. DEFICIENT. (See Attachments 4 and 5)

REMARKS/COMMENTS: JUN - 7 1995 
Phenytoin starting material is synthesized under DMI . which is currently under review and 
contains some major deficiencies. In genera!, the deficiencies in the NOA appear to be minor, 
however some control issues need to be resolved. Fer one intermediate in the fosphenytoin 
synthesis, there is no data to show that it is not present as an impurity in the drug 
substance. The proposed impurity limits for the drug product need to be evaluated. 
CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Establishment Evaluations, Microbiology and Environmental Assessment are still pending as is 
Methods Validation (this cannot be initiated until we obtain a satisfactory response to questions 
about possible impurities in the n.d.s., see Item :; of draft letter]. Due to these issues, and 
manufacturing deficiencies in both the NOA and DMF lhe NOA is Not Approvable for 
Chemistry at this time.

(foaphenytoin sodium) 
Injection 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) as the national charter 
for protection, restoration, and enhancement of the environment. 
NEPA establishes policy, sets goals (section 101), and provides 
procedures (section 102) for carrying out the policy. 
Environmental information is to be available to the public and 
the decisionmaker before decisions are made about actions that 
may significantly affect the quality of the human environment; 
FDA actions are to be supported by accurate scientific analyses; 
and environmental documents are to concentrate on timely and 
significant issues, not to amass needless detail. 
The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research has carefully considered the potential environmental 
impact of this action and has concluded that this action will not 
have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment 
and that an environmental impact statement therefore will not be 
prepared. 
In support of their new drug application for Cerebyx®, Warner­
Lambert Company has conducted a number of environmental studies 
and prepared an environmental assessment in accordance with 21 
CFR 25.3la(a) (attached) which evaluates the potential 
environmental impacts of the manufacture, use and disposal of the 
product. 
Fosphenytoin sodium is a synthetic drug which is administered as 
an injectable solution in the treatment and control of seizures 
in patients with status epilepticus. The drug substance will be 
manufactured at Parke-Davis Holland Chemi~al Facility, Holland, 
Michigan. The drug product will be manufactured at Parke-Davis 
Rochester Facility, Rochester, Michigan. The finished drug 
product will be used in hospitals and clinics. .. 
Fosphenytoin sodium is a pr~drug which is rapidly and completely 
converted to phenytoin in vivo. Patient excretions contain a 
small percentage of the dose as phenytoin (<St), some dihydrodiol 
phenytoin ("7-llt) and the major metabolite 5-(4-hydroxyphi!nyl) -
5-phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) (-67-88%). small amounts of 
fosphenytoin sodium may enter the environment due to manufacture. 
Chemical and physical test results indicate that fosphenytoln 
sodium, phenytoin and, the major metabolite, p-HPPH will most 
likely be restricted to the aquatic environment. 
Hydrolysis of fosphenytoin and phenytoin and photolysis of 
fosphenytoin sodium is expected to be slow under environmental 
conditions. Fospnenytoin is rapidly biotransformed to phenytoin 
under biodegradation test conditions, phenytoin is not chemically 
converted and p-HPPH can be complet~ly biodegraded, although the 
biodegradation is not rapid. 
As fosphenytoin and the major metabolites are expected to persist 
in the aquatic environment for some time, the toxicity of 
fosphenytoin sodium, phenytoin and p-HPPH to aquatic organisms 
was characterized. Acute static toxicity studies in water fleas 
(Daphnia magna) indicate that the drug substance is generally not 
toxic to aquatic organisms at concentrations of at least 5 orders 
of magnitude greater than the maximum expected environmental 
concentration (MEEC) . 
Microbial inhibition studies indicate that environmental 
microorganisms are not inhibited at concentrations of at least 7 
orders of magnitude greater than the maximum expected 
environmental concentration (MEEC) . 
Disposal of the drug may result from out of specification lots, 
discarding of unused or expired product, and user disposal of 
empty or partly used product and packaging. Returned drug 
product will be disposed of at a licensed incineration facility. 
Out-of-specification drug product and drug substance will be 
reprocessed or disposed of at a licensed incineration facility. 
At U.S. hospitals and clinics, empty or partially empty packages 
will be disposed according to hospital/clinic regulations. 
The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has concluded that 
the product can be manufactured, used and disposed of without any 
expected adverse environmental effects. Precautions taken at the sites of manufacture of the bulk product and its final 
formulation are expected to minimize occupational exposures and 
environmental release. Adverse effects are not anticipated upon 
endangered or threatened species or upon property listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

Solid waste is generated in the bulk pharmaceutical production at the Holland plant in 
2 forms. Waste cabs from process solution filtration, and mixed wastewater 
filtntion. The former solids are isolated from Niagaxa (stacked plate) pressi.re filters, 
and are pr..marily activated caibon and diatomaceous eatth filter aid from decolorizing 
operations. The latter type is a product of process wastewater filtntion. Suspmded 
solids present in the wasteWatcr are removed after pH adjustment by passing the water 
through a rotary pxecoat filter. Slndge from the wastewater is peeled off the filter 
along with diatomaceous earth filter aid. Both of these sludges are combined in 
roll-off Lopp>rs and disposed of in a bazaxdous waste landfill.

Off-specification (including rejected) and excess Fosphenytoin sodium will be 
containerized and stored in the Haz.ardous Waste Storage Shed prior to transport to a 
licensed hazardous waste incinerator. Storage of this waste shall not exceed 90 days 
from initial placement in the storage shed. All waste shipments shall be properly 
manifested using Michigan Department of Natural Resources UnifOim Manifests. 
:Manifest copies will be kept and submitted as required by Michigan Public Act 64. 
6.8. Materials F.mittecl into tbe Air in Rochester, Michigan 012 
Air-borne particulates may be generated during the fOimulation process, although such 
an occurrence is unUJcr:Jy. Bulk Fosphenytoin sodium powder is weighed-out in the 
Drug & Chemical Dispensing area prior to delivery to the bulk fOimulation room. 
The Drug & Chemical area is equipped with several in-line HEPA filtering systems 
capable of 99 % particulate removal efficiencies prior to discharge to the ambient 
atmJsphere. In the bulk fOimulation room, Fosphenytoin sndinm is added dim:tly to 
the injection solution containing; water for injection; buffet sn!ntioas; and 
trometbamine. The rewl.ting mixtim is agitated to completely mix the ingredients. 
The miTing occurs in an enclosed fomiulation tank, thus mjnimjzing potential air 
releases. Vapor pressures of all ingredients are very low and none are expected to 
vapori7.e during handHng and mi:ring. Nevertheless, application of air emission 
permit.s has been gmnted for HBPA filters in Drug and Chemical Dispensing and 
solution manufacturing areas. The numbers authorizing agencies, requirements, and 
other pertinent infomiation are mmmarized in Appendix 6. All employees working 
with Fosphenytoin Injection production will adhcte to Warner-Lambert's Safe 
Handling Guideline for Fosphenytoin sodium (Appendix 7) which require the use of 
personal protective equipment. Additionally, Tndumja! Hygiene monitoring will be 
conducted to verify that wmker exposures to all Fosphenytoin Injection ingredients 
are below Occupational Bxposure Guidelines (OBGs). 
6.9. Compliance With Regulatory Statues and Fmisc!on Standards 
The Holland, Michigan, Puke-Davis facility maintains compliance with the following 
fedenil, state, and 1ocail regulations. Tue in.crease in waste generation and emissions 
due tCI Fosphenytoin sodium production will be negligible and will not adversely 
impact our ability to comply with these rules.

assumes that all the Fospbenytoin prodnced will be sold and used by parir:nts, and that 
none will be left uusoJd, 11m1wl by patients, or will expire or be rewmed for disposal 
outside sewage treatment systems, and (2) It assumes that all of the Fosphenytoin

systems. Patient metabolism will obviously reduce the quantity of Fosphenytoin 
sodium reaching the enviroumeut, as will discharge into piivate septic systems.

phenytoin (Appendix 8), it is expcct.ed that Fospbenytoin sodium to be largeiy 
meiabolized to bydroxylated phenytoin. The major metabolite, S-(4-hydroxyphenyl)· 
S-phenylhydantoin (p-BPPB) excreted in urine,~ for 67% to 88% of 
administered dose. The other urinary m:tabolite is dihydrodiol phenytoin which only 
accounted for about 7% to 11,:; of the dose. Less than S'Jr. of the dose is expected to 
be excreted in urine as unchanged phenytoin. Acc:ordingl.y, data were developed on 
Fospbenytoin, phenytoin and p-hydroxyphenytoin (BPPH).

7.6. Sorption/Desorption 
The propensity for human drug substances to be tr..nsported from disposal sites is 
determined by factors contributing to their distribution, mobility, and persistenre in 
the environment. Partitioning between solid and aqueous phases influences mobility 
by controlling sorption and leaching rates. A measure of a compound's tendency to 
sorb and desorb readily can predict the ultimate disposition of residues as either 
bound to soil/sludge, or as fuely soluble matcrlal. 
FosphenytOin sodium, phenytoin, and hydroxyphenytoin were studied to determine 
their soiption and desorption prtll.erties following the FDA Environmental Assessment 
Technical Assistana: Handbook Section 3.08. Three soil types were used with both 
reagent water to mimic "soft• water, and 0.01 M Caeli to approximate "hard" water. 
For Fosphenytoin sodium, 11 a solution to soil ratio of S: 1, results showed that the 
mean percent sc~ for all 3 soil types ranged from 19.o,; to 42.4" in CaCI.i and 
from 8.68" to 29.9,; in magent water. When desorption was tested, none of the 
sorbed Fosphalytoin sodi11m could be removed from reagent water or CaCJ.i. This 
indicated that FosphenytOin sodium was strongly bound to the 3 types of soils tested, 
but the low desorption was probably due co rapid degtadation or.cun:ing in the 
sampl~. Since radiolabeled Fosphenytoin sodium was not aw.ilable for this study,

7. 7. Photolysis 
Fosphenytoin soclinm was studied to drtennine ita potelltial for photolysis following 
the FDA Environmental Aswsmeztt Techniciil A•si~ Handbook Section 3.10. 
Photolysis as a pathway for degradation a·n be important from an cnviroomental 
perspective since most phannaceuticals will enter the cmvi.-nnment in a dissolved 
form, whether from disclwge from the site of production or from patic:nt use. 
Photolysis occurs when a dissolved compound ablOlbs light and degrades through 
energy transfer. 024 
Photolysis was investigated al 3 pHs, 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 for a 30-day period. Results 
demonstrated that Fospbenytoin sndjnm i~ rcla!i.vcly resistant to photolym. The 
half-lives were determined w be 112 days 11 pB 5, 193days11 pH 7, and 86 days 11 
pH 9. Correlation coefficieuts ranged from 0.586 to 0.654 and are consistent with 
half lives 3 to 6 times longer than the experimental period. These data indicat.c, that 
photolysis in aqueous solution is i10t a primary removal mtdianism for Fosphenytoin 
sodium in the environment.

7.8. Biodegradation in Water 
Biodegradation is a process by which organic chemicals may be significantly reduced 
in their structural complexity in the environment through biological means. 
Knowledge of the potential for biodegradation of a chemical is often crittcal in the 
assessment of environmental exposure and impact of the chemical. 1be objective of 
the study was to determine the potential for biodegradation of Fosphenytoin sodium 
under standard labotatory conditions. 'Ibe biodegndation studies were conducted 
according to modified methods and procedures based in part on the information 
published in the FDA Technical Assistance Handbook, Section 3.11. 
A~robic biodegradation studies in water were performed with Fosphenytoin sodium, 
[14C..)>henytoin and (14C]hydroxyphenytoin. Test flasks were incubated It 22°C in 025 
the dark to minimi:r.e the potential for photolysis, and inocuJated with a bacterial 
population obtained from a publicly owned sewage treatment plant. The study design 
was a batch activated s'11dge simulation in which activated sludge was m:noved from a 
local waste water treatment worla and used in a concenttation similar to that found in 
most treat. ,wet plants, 3,000 mg solids per liter of solution. ('lbc study design 
recommended in the haDdbook is based on a solids concentrations several orders of 
magnitude lower). The studies were conducted in tripllcasr: with glm:ose as a positive 
reference c:nntrol, and negative blank controls. The quantity of carbon dioxide 
(14CQV released as a result of microbial degradation in the sludge/water was 
measured. HPLC m.eamrements were pelfmmed periodiclllly to determine whether 
paltial degradation of Fos:>henytoin sodium, bad occurred. 
From the Fosphenytoin sodium flasks, the cumulative C~ collected over 28 days was 
negligible relative to the~ initially applied. Volatile organic products also were 
not detected from these flasks. From the glucose flasks, greater than 609' of the 
dosed radioactivity was collec:ted as C~. While these results showed no evidence for 
the complete biodegtadation of Fosphenytoin sodium to CIIbon dioxide, analysis of 
the test solutions containing Fosphenytoin sodium were performed using BPLC 
U:INDAICl·982\REG332RA.EA2 Fosphenytoin Sodium

throughout tbe study. Results of these analyses indicated complete bioO'ansfor:mation 
to phenytoin occurred in the first day. 
1be complete final report on the aerobic aquatic biodegradation of Fosphenytoin 
sodium, Study Number 10320-1093-6136-731, Report Number 94-6-S349 is anach~ 
as Appendix 20. 
From the [14C]phenytoin flasks, the cumulative 14CC>i collected over 42 days was 
r.ogligible relative to the dose initiaJJy applied. 14C-volatile organic products also 
were not detected from these flasks. From the 14C-glucose flasks, greater than 60$ 
of the dosed radioactivity was collected as 14CC>i. Analysis of the teSt solutions 
containing [14C]phenytoin were perfolDlcd using HPI.C-RAM throughout the study 
and indicated that no chemical conversion occurred during the study.

Number 10320-0394-6142-731, Report Number 94-6-5337 is attached as 
Appendix 21. 026 
From the [14C]hydroxyphenytoin fia.sb, the cumulative 14CC>i collected over 42 days 
was approximately 10$ of the dose initially applied. 14C-Volatile cnganic products 
were not detected from these flasks. From the 14C-glucose flasks, greater than 60$ 
of the dosed radioactivity was collectrd as 14CC>i. 'Ibese results demonstrated 
conclusively that the complete biodegl:adation of [14C]hydroxyphenytoin to carl>on 
dioxide can occur using organisms commonly found in publicly owned treatment 
plants. However, this bioclqradalion is not rapid. Analysis of the test solutions 
containing [14C]hydroxypbmytoin we.re performed using HPLC-RAM throughout the 
study and indicated that approximately 30'5 of the applied test substance bad degraded 
to more polar products. 'l111is cbancterization of polarity was made by comparison of 
HPI.C P.tmtion times.

The environmental distribution of Fosphenytoin sodium should plac:e in the aquatic 
phase. The low vapor pressure demonstrates that the atmospheric companment will 
not be significantly affected by release of Fosphenytoin. With the extremely low 
solids level of sewage treatment plants, Fosphenytoin and its degradation products 027 
will be pmsent primarily in the hydraulic phase. The ultimate fate of Fospbenytoin is 
detennined in part by the metabolism in patients and the biodegradation in water. 
Metabolism data indicates that Fosphenytoin is completely modified by patients to the 
hydroxy derivative, hydroxyphenytoin. Biodegradation data shows that 
hydroxyphenytoin will easily liegrade when exposed to common bacteria indigenous to 
sewage treatment plants. 'Ibmefore, fosphenytoin and its degradation products will 
not persist in the environment. 
8. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF RELEASED SUBSTANCFS 
Production, use and discharge of Fosphenytoin sndium into the environment will pose 
no adverse effect on humans, animals, plants or eavinmmcntJJJ.y significant 
oigamsnu.. All organisms tested indiaited that no threat to any of them BR' possible 
at concentrations at or near those caJcnlated to occur upon approval of this NDA. 
As a measme of the tMicity of any chemical, the determination of the lowest 
concentration that inhibits microbial growth is import'1Dt because of possible 
ramifications if that concentration is exceeded in the eavimnmeDt. 1bree microbial 
growth inh.ibition studies were conducted according to die methods and pnx:edures 
pub!ishe<l in the FDA Trdmical Auistance Handbook, Section 4.02. The microbial 
inhibitmy concentrations (MIC1) of Fospllcnytoin sodium, phenytoin and 
hydroxyphenytoin were ddmnin!'11 for each of S species. For all 3 compounds, 
preliminary tests using concerurmons of 0.1 to 1000 ppm (0.1 mg/L to 1000 mg/L) 
showed no effects to all S species invcstigattd at all coDCelltrations testro including 
1000 mglL. Based on the results of thti preliminary exposure, definitive lc$tS were 
not conducted. The MICs reported were defined as the lowest concentrations of the&: 
materials that completely inhibited the growth of the test oigallism.

The acute toxicities (concentration at which SO% of the orr.."'nisms are affected or 
ECso> of Fospbenytoin sodium, phenytoin and hydroxyphenytoin to Daphnia magna 
(,1 freshwater invertebrate), were investigated. 1bis organism is often tested and 
considered to be 1 of the most le"•irive aquatic species available for stanaardized 
aquatic studies. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was cfetennined as

During the Daphnia magna acute toxicity study with Fosphenyt.oin sodjnm, 
immobi1inrion or subleth:d effects were observed among c!aphnids exposed to several 
of the measured concentrations (0% at 23, 48 and 94 mg/L, 10'5 at 190 mg/L, 75'5 
at 380 mg/L, and 100% at 7t$J mg/L) following 24-hours of exposure. After 
48-hours' exposure, 75% were immobiliz.ed at 190 mg/L, 95% at 380 mg/L, and 
100'5 at the highest conc:eattation, 7t$J mg/L. No immobilization was observed at 
lower concentrations or in the control solations (some emdc behavior was noted at 
94 mg/L). The outcome of the study wu a ai!adated 48-hour BCso for c!aphnids

The nmowest mugin of safety for Fosphenytoin sodium is based on the NOEC fuf 
Daphnia magna (the most aensitive species tested) and is c:alr.ulaied by dividing ...-........... "'""'.....,.. 48 mg/L by,_ (the mjm=- e•1iec:tec1 c:oncentration based on 
distribution of all Fospbalytoin over the entire United States). This caJcularion 
results in a safety mugin of 1,067,000. Similar safety margins for phenytoin and 
hydroxyphenytoin uaing the NOBCa dcmmiW'd ~· The safety 
margin for pbenytoin is 500,000 and for hydroxypbenytoin, 609,000. 
Based on the documented rapid degradation pathways and the large safety margins 
(greater than 100,000), Fc;;phenytoin sodium has been shown to have no effect on the

extemal aquatic environment. Fosphenytoin sodium was shown to degrade in water 
with a half life of less than 1 day under microbially populated conditions similar to 
those seen in wastewater treatment plants. 1bis clearly demonsuatcs that 
Fosphenytoin snd»un will not persist in the envUonment. Furtbennore, Fosphenytoin 
sodium was shown to have no effect on a wide variety of micioo1gaoisms at 
conccntntions as high as 1000 mg/L. Tbc Leso to Dapbnia magna was determined 
to be 170 mg/L and the no observed effect conc:entntion was cala•btecf to be 
48 mg/L. This lowest risk concent:ratbn is more than 1,000,000 times higher than 
that which would occur if all the produced Fosphenytoin were used and clischatged 
over the entire Unitecf States. 
Metabolism data produced by Parlee-Davis jrvHcatt!.C that the entiie quantity of 
Fosphenytoin sodium taken by patients is excreted as hydroxypbmytoin. 
Hydroxyphenytoin has been proven to biodegrade to more polar compounds and 
ultimately to cubon dimidc. Furthermore, DO toxicity was observed for 
hydruxyphenytoin at the limit of solubility. Therefore, degradation pathways were 
determined for the parent drug submnce Fnsphrnytoin, and the ultimately discharged 
metabolite, hydroxyphenytoin. Tbc intermediate in dqp'adarion, phenytoin, which is 
fonned in vivo tnin•iently, was not obaerved to degrade under the labot2lory 
conditions employed. Nonetheless, no environmental. effects weic obaerved at 
concentrations within 100,000-fold of the predicted environmental concentration. 
9. USE OF RFSOURCFS AND ENERGY 
In 1993, the Holland, Michigan llJ.UIUfactming site used 19,643,113 kilowatts of 
electricity and 34.62 x 1010 BTU of steam to produce 1,085,153 kg cf drug 
substmces. lbtdifth--year produ;:tion estimate for Fosphi!nytoin is pounds 
(11,253 kg) and xqn:sents an ir.c:rease of 1.04,;, on 11 q basis. 
The production of Fosphenytoin sodium represents Jes,.d'11a&-0f the total 
pham.aceutical production at the Rochester facility. The pxopoaed action will not 
alter land use since production will tab place on pmiiiw cmreatly owned by 
Parke-Davis and utilized for the manufacture of phaxmaceutical products. 1be use of

REMARKS/COMMENTS: 
Several minor amendments were submitted after completion of Review #2. Change in expiration da!e from 
18 months to 24 months (01-JAN-se amendment)will require adjustment of the post-approval stability protocol. 
Site inspections are complete and a copy of the EER is attached. OM. was revised on 18-SEP-95 and 
is satisfactory for use of phenytoin in synth.!Sis of fosphenytoin. Methods Validation is not complete. 
CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Recommend APPROVABLE for Chemistry. The firm should increase stability sterility testing to ensure the 
product remains sterile through a 24 month expiration date [Draft letter attached] and correct microbiology 
defic1enc1es. Letter to ~ponsor should contain standard methods validation paragraph.

The 05-SEP-95 amendment contained additional copies of the sponsor's Methods Validation package and 
sample identification (lot ffs etc). Methods validation was performed by the DOA laboratory in St. Louis and 
by the Detroit District laboratory. Both analysts were able lo reproduce the methods and found them generally 
satisfactory with some comments [see review notes]. 
CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Methods validation is completed and methods validation paragraph in action letter is not necessary. The NOA

Attention: Irwin G. Martin. Ph.D 
2800 Plymouth Road, P.O. Box 1047 
Ann Arbor, Ml 48106-1047 
Dear Dr. Martin: Food and Drug Adm1nrstrat;on 
Rockville MD 20857 
SEP I 2 1994 
Reference is made to your new drug ;opplication submitted under section 505(b) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Fosphenytoin Sodium Injection (Cerebyx®). 
Or. the basis of our initial review of your New Drug Application referred to above. 
received on July 15, 1994 and acknowledged on July 28, 1994, we have determined that 
the application is not acceptable for filing under 21 CFR 314.101 (d)(3). 
The application is incomplete beca..ise it does not on its face contain information required 
under section 505(b) and 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5). 
Clinical Safety Data: 
1. Inadequate studies to show that the product will be safe for use under the 
conditions of use recommended in the proposed labeling. 
The application contains reports of only 4 patients with status epilepticus who 
have been treated with fosphenytoin at rates of infusion at or above 225 mg/min. 
Experience in normals at this dose and rate combination is also limited; although 
the application does not supply a precise number, preliminary review estimates 
that no more than 20 normals may have been so exposed. 
Accordingly, the information submitted is inadequate to permit a substantive 
assessment of whether or not fosphenytoin will be safe for use when administered 
under the conditions of use recommended in the Dosage and Administration 
Section of the proposed labeling which recommends, for the treatment of Status 
Epilepticus, that an intravenous dose of 22.5 to 30 mglkg given "At least 150 
mg/min up to 225 mg/min" be administered as a single dose. Additionally, the 
section recommends, for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures, that an IM NOA 20-450 2 
or IV administration of 15 to 30 mg/kg fosphenytoin be given "up to 225 mg/min" 
as a single dose. 
2. Lack of tests and/or reports on tests to show that the drug will be safe ior use; a 
lack of information on the plasma concentrations of formaldehyde: 
The application does not provide re'lorts on the concentration of formaldehyde 
formed in plasma during the administration of your product when used as 
recommended in product labeling. Formaldehyde is a toxir, and is formed during 
the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin. 
Your firm has been advised repeatedly for the need to provide this information, 
and has, nevertheless, failed to do so. 
·Ne note that your NOA SUMMARY;NDA Overview subsection (Item 2.2, page 
106) discusses this and states that a complete discussion of this issue could be 
found unaer NOA Item 5, section 5.5.4.6, Tab 55. Our preliminary review of the 
cited reference to clinical data (RR 744-00024, Study 9653-86-01) reveals, 
however, that NO data res"arding formate levels in human trials is included in the 
cited study report. 
Environmental Assessment 
Although not reasons for this Refuse to File Action, our environmental assessment staff 
has completed a preliminary review of your EA and has asked that the following 
comments be forwarded. 
1. General issues: 
a. The drug substance and drug product are incorrectly identified throughout 
the environmental assessment (e.g., the drug substance is identified as 
Fosphenyto1n instead of the sodium salt). Please correct the 
environmental assessment (pages 3-28) to reflect the correct termim,logy. 
b. The information in the Environmental Assessment is releasable under the 
Freedom of Information Act. Any proprietary information should be 
provided in Appendices and be clearly marked as confidential. Some of 
the information included in your environmental assessment may be 
confidential (e.g., the list of raw materials used in the synthesis of 
Fosphenytoin Sodium or the fifth year production estimates). If you wish 
you may move this information to an app•:mdix and provide only summary 
information in the actual environmental assessment. NOA 20-450 3 
c. A flow diagram for the synthesis of the drug substance and the 
manufacturing process for the drug product was provided by FAX on 
August 22, 1994. Please provide an official copy to the file. 
2. Please describe the locations where the drug pwduct is expected to be Llsed 
(Section IV}. 
3. What is the disposition of returned or expired drug product and rejected drug 
substance (Section IV)? 
4. The Identification of Chemical Substance (Section V) should be revised to incluoe: 
a. The correct Chemit.al Name; i.e., the sodium salt; 
b. An appropriate synonym (i.e., sodium salt) with a reference (IUPAC, USAN, 
etc.,); 
c. A structural formula; 
d. A list of the additives used or lack thereof; and 
e A list of the impurities or lack thereof. 
5. A Materiai Safety Data She"'t for Fosphenytoin Sodium should be provided 
(Section V). 
6. Incomplete information (except for HEPA/air handling at Rochester) is provided 
regarding the introduction of substances in the environment, specifically the 
controls, effect of compliance with current emissions requirements, and estimate 
oi the quantities and concentrations of substances expected to enter the 
environment (Section VI). 
a. For ai•. liquid and solids emissions originating at both the Holland and 
Rochester facilities the following should be provided: 
1. Emission permit numbers, authorizing Agencies and permit 
expiration dates; 
11. Applicable emission requirements (both qualitative and quantitative); 
111. An estimate, through use of calculations or direct measure. of the 
possible quantities and concentrations of substances expected to 
enter the environment (i';fth year production estimatGs); and NOA 20-450 
IV. Effect of the quantities/concentrations (from 6.a.iii.) on meeting both 
the qualitative and quantitative emission requirements. 
Inclusion of actual permits is not required. For ease of review it is 
preferred that this information be presented in a table format. 
Any of the requested information that is not applicable to a specific 
permit/emission (e.g., permit expiration date, quantitative emission 
requirement) should be clearly indicated/explained. 
If Warner Lambert does not have direct control (permits) over the waste 
disposal (e.g., solid waste), the contractors and/or facilities involved 
should be identified. 4 
b. There are three air permits pending approval at the Holland facility for this 
product. Please update the status of these permits and indicate when 
approval is expected. 
c. A discussion of the disposal of solid waste generated by the production of 
the material at the Holland facility should be included. 
d. On pages 10 and 11 the expected environmental concentrations should be 
identified as "maximum" not "minimum". 
7. Citation of and a statement of compliance with any appropriate Federal, State and 
Local occupational exposure requirements should be provided (Section VI). 
8. The following are in regards to the fate of the emitted substances in the 
environment (Section VII) 
a. The estimated percent excreted as phenytoin and hydroxyphenytoin should 
be provided if available. 
b. No information was provided regarding hydrolytic stability or dissociation 
constants for the compounds of interest. 
c. For the water solubility determination, a complete test report which includes 
information such as the methodology used, study site, temperature at 
which the solubility was determined and the HPLC method should be 
provided. If the HPLC method is the one included in the NOA it need only 
be referenced by number. NOA 20-450 5 
d. For the partition coefficient determination a complete test report which 
includes information such as the test methodo:ogy, the study site, 
concentrations at which the study was performed !Note: FDA methodology 
requires that 2 different concentrations be used) and the HPLC method 
should be provided. If the HPLC method is the one included in the NOA 
it need only be referenced by number. 
e. The conclusion regarding the aquatic photolytic degradation of 
Fosphenytoin Sodium (page 17, last sentence in second paragraph) should 
be revised to indicate that photolysis is not a primary removal mechanism 
of Fosphenytoin from the environment. 
f. You have indicated that aerobic aquatic biodegradation of 
Hydroxyphenytoin is rapid and that it has been proven/demonstrated to 
completely degrade to CO, (pages 17 and 21) The data provided does not 
support these conclusions. The appropriate statements should be revised 
to state that the data indicates that this biodegradation will occur, but that 
it is not rapid. 
9. Please revise Section XI to state that based on the data you believe that there will 
be no impact on the environment (or similar wording). 
10. You state that no consultan~s were used (Section XII), but have used the services 
of at least . _ Please revise as 
needed. The Curricula vitae cited were not included in Appendix 26. 
Within 30 days of the date of this letter, you may request in writing an informal 
conference about FD.ti's refusal to file the application. To file this application over FDA's 
protest, you must avail yourself of tn1::; :nformal conference. 
Should questions arise regarding this application, please contact Mr. Robbin 
Nighswander, Project Manager, at (301) 594-2777.

SYNOPSIS: 
Background: Ganciclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analog that inhibits replication of human 
herpes viruses. Intravenous ganciclovir is approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis in 
AIDS patic-nts and for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant patients. The oral 
formulation is indicated as an alternative to the intravenous formulation for maintenance 
therapy of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients, including patients with AIDS, in 
whom retinitis is stable following appropriate induction therapy and for whom the risk of a 
more rapid progression is balanced by the benefit associated with avoiding daily infusions. 
The maintenaDce dose for oral ganciclovir is 1000 mg t.i.d. with food. A.lternativ~ly, a 
regimen of 500 mg q3h 6 times a day with food, while awake, may be used. 
' - -. I 
The absolute bioavailability of ganciclovir after oral administration is low ( -53 to 9%). 
Plasma protein binding for ganciclovir is low (1to2%). Approximately 903 of an orally 
administered dose of ganciclovir is excreted unchanged in urine and feces within 5 days of 
administration. When administered orally, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokineti~ up to a 
total daily dose of 4glday. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomen:lar filtration and 
active t'1bular secretion is the major route of elimination of gancidovir. The average half life 
following intravenr>us and oral ganciclovir is approximately 3.5 and 5 hours, respectively. 
Summary: This document contains reviews of two bioe4uivalence studies suhmitted as a 
supplement to NDA 20460. The cu"rrent formulation for oral ganciclovir, which has been 
arproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admini~tration, is a 250 mg hard gelatin capsutz. In 
order to increase the convenience of dosing with oral ganciclovir, a 500 mg capsule 
formulation has been developed. Both formulations comain tl1c same ingredients in the same 
proportions and use the same type of hard gelatin capsule. The only differences between the

Study GANS2638 was a pivotal study conducted to determine the bioequivalence under steady 
state conditions of the 500 mg capsule formulation (at a dose of 1000 mg q8h) of ganeiclovir to 
the 250 mg capsule formulation (at a dose of 1000 mg q8h). This was a single center, open 
label, randomized, two way crossover study in 14 RN-positive male subjects. Assessment of 
bioequivalence was done using 90% confidence limits for the pbarmacokinetic parameters 
AUCo-1 and C_.. AUC.... and c_ passed the criteria for bioequivalence. The statistical 
analysis indicated that the T.,.. for the reference (250 mg capsule) was significantly longer than 
for the test (500 mg capsule).

Study GANS2686 was initiated as a result of the discovery of :i new crystal fonn~f _ 
ganciclovir in both the 250 mg and 500 mg capsules. The discovery was made after the 
approvai of the 250 mg capsule NOA. Some r.apsule lots for which the hydrated Phase U 
crystal form of ganciclovir converts to the Phase rn crystal form over time show a decrease in 
dissolution rale under ambient storage conditions. The trend of dissolution slowing under 
ambient storage co:1ditions has not been observed for lots without the Phase III crysta~ form. 
The 'cudy was con.!•!cted to determine the bioequivalence of four treatments (A, B, C and D) 
of •.nal ganciclovir having different dissolution characteristics, storage conditions and crystal 
form compositions. Treatment A was the reference and B. C and D were the test treatments. 
·,·he scudy was performed under steady state conditions, at a dose of 1000 mg q8h. This was a 
single center. open label, randomized, four way crossover study in 24 HIV-positive subjects. 
A~scssrnent of bioequivalence was done using 903 confidence limits for the pharmacokinetic 
parameters, AUCo.8, and Cm,.. The 903 confidence intervals showed that AU~8 and C.,..

Dissolution Method and Specification for Ganciclovir 500 mg Capsules: The recommended 
dissolution method for the ganciclovir 500 mg capsules utilizes 
. 
This method is the same as that for the approved 250 mg capsule. Th~ 
proposed specification for ganciclovir 500 mg is Q= dissolved in 45 minutes. The 
specification proposed is than the current specification for the 250 mg capsule of 
Q = diss(>lved in 45 minutes. 
The applicant has based this specification (Q = in 45 minutes) primarily on results 
from bioequivalence srudy GANS 2686 which showed that 500 mg capsules with dissolution 
rate 01 n 45 minutes were bioequivalent to the currently marketed 250 mg capsules. 
However. review of the dissolution data for the lots used in the bioavailability studies and for

( 4 
the stability lots suggest that Q = in 45 minutes would be appropriate. 
Conclusions: For the pivotal biocquivalence study, GANS2638, the test treaunent (500 mg) 
passed the criteria for bioequivalence. For GANS2686, test treatments B and C p~setI the 
criteria for bioequivalence, however, treatment D did not. (For treatment D, AU~ passed the 
criteria for bioequivalence, but C.,.. did not). Treatment D also exhibited the slowest 
dissolution characteristics. Tiie storage conditions (elevated temperature and high relative 
humidity) and the predominance of Phase III crystals for Treatment D may be a reason for the 
poor dissolution characteristics for this treatment. The test product in the pivotal study GANS 
2638 was from the same batch as the test product for Treatment D in GAN2686. In the pivotal 
study GANS 2638, the capsules were stored at 25"C and ambient RH (as opposed to study 
GANS 2686 where the storage conditions were 4<J'C and 75% RH). In the pivotal study 
GANS 2638, both C.... and AU~ for the test product met the biocquivaleoce criteria. -The 
results from this study suggest that tlJc 500 mg ganciclovir capsules should not be stored at 
conditions greater than that of ambient temperature and relative humidity (this conclusion was 
also made by the chemistry reviewer). 
Labeling: Tiie proposed labeling revisions are acceptable. 
Note: An Intra-division CPB briefing was held on October 31, 1997. 
Attendees: Dr. John Lazor, Dr. Janice Jenkins, Dr. Dennis Bashaw, Dr. Frank Pelsor, Dr. 
Furuni Ajayi, Ms. Terrie Cresem:i 
Based on the discussions at the briefing, the following comments were addressed to the 
applicant. 
COMMENTS TO APPLICANT: 
l. Based on the dissolution data (release data) for the 500 mg capsule lots used in the two 
bioavailability studies (GANS 2638 and GANS 2686) and the data for the stability lots (12514-
1, 12516-1. 1195001, 1195051, 1195091). we feel that a dissolution specification of Q ~ · 
~ in 45 minmes would be appropriate for the 500 mg ganciclovir capsules. (This specification is 
also the current interim dissolution specification for the 250 mil ganciclovir capsules). 
2. The dis"ilut1on data for the 3 regislration batches (1500571. 1500581. 1500591) stored at 
ambient conditions with and without desiccant suggest that the presence of desiccant in the 
container prevems slowing of the dissolution profile (which is observed under conditions where 
·.10 desiccant is present). We feel that the dissolution data for batches stored with desiccant 
meet the requirements ofQ= in 45 minutes (even after storage for 12 months). 
3. Treatments C and D (from Study GANS 2686) have ~imilar polymorphic c~mposition 
(predominantly Phase Ill crystals). Therefore. the presence of Phase Ill crystals does not -· ( 5 
explain the slowing of di5solution for treatment D. We feel that the slowing of di.~solution may 
be associated with the hard gelatin shell of the capsules, and we would Iir.e you to study the 
dissolution profiles for the four study treatments from Study GANS 2686, in particular 
treatment D with and without enzymes (two-tier dissolution testing). Since your lnitifll test 
medium is watr.r, we would like for you to perform the two-tier dissolution test in water. 
Also, we would like you to perform the two-tier dissoluiion test using llllOther mediwn such as 
O. IN HCl/pepsin or pH 6.8 buffer/pancreatin. 
Note: A teleconference was held with applicant on November 20, 1997 to discuss the above 
issues (as weli as other issues related to CMC). There was agreement between the applicant 
and the agency regarding setting the dissolution ~pecification for the 500 mg ganciclovir 
capsules at Q= dissolved in 45 minutes. Following the teleconference, the applicant 
submitted dissolution data for capsules from treatments C and D (from Study GANS 2686) 
using two-tier dissolution testing with O. IN HCl/pepsin as the medium. ThCse data (attached as 
Appendix 4) were generated to investigate how much of the dissolution is due to 
capsule fill versus capsule shell effects. These data suggest that for treatment C,, the 
dissolution is faster in 0. lN HCl/pepsin compared to water or 0. lN HCL alone suggesting that 
in this case the dissolution slowing was primarily due to the capsule shell effects. For treatment 
C, the proposed dissolution specification of Q '= in 45 minutes is met when dissolution is 
performed in simulated gastric fluid medium. However, for treatment D, the dissolution rate 
in simulated gastric fluid is moderately faster than in 0. lN HCL, but about the same as it is in 
water. For treatment D, the proposed dissolution specification of Q = in 45 minutes is not 
met even when dissolution is performed in simulated gastric fluid medium. This suggests that 
the dissolution slowing in this case may be attributable to capsule fill effects. 
Recommendation: The applicant has adequately addressed the requirements of the Division of 
Pharmaceutical Evaluation III for approval of the 500 mg ganciclovir capsules as an additional 
dosage form. _ • • •

Enrollment: Of 24 subjects enrolled, 21 completed the study. 
Protocol violations: Entry criteria were met by <Jll subjects. 
Withdrawals: Three sub1ects terminated the study early, 2 for adverse events (facial swelling-see 
Premature Terminations. below) and 1 tor personat reasons. 
E. Safety results 
2 ( Deaths. There were no deaths. 
Serious Adverse Events. There were no serious adverse events. 
Premature terminations. Two subjects are described as having had severe facial swelling, each after 
receiving 2 of the 4 regimens. Because of concern that facial swelling might relate to study drug, the 
Principle Investigator prematurely terminated both subjects from the study. • ' 
In both instances, facial swelling was identified during evaluation ririor to dosing at the third dosing 
period. One subject had received Regimens Band C, and the other, Regimens A and B during the first 
two dosing periods. 
Comment: In contro:led trials, facial ~welling is not an event that has been found to 
relate to GCV therapy. In this study, the GCV treatment in Period 2 in both cases 
involved the 500 mg capsule dosing form; the capsules were, however, from a different 
drug lot in each case. facial swelling was not reported in these subjects while on GCV 
therapy, but after 3 days following the last GCV dose in the previous dosing period. 
Thus, facial swelling, if related t:> GCV therapy in this case, would presumably relate 
specifically to the 500 mg dosing form, and is a relatively delayed event. 
The Applicant was asked to provide additional information and to comment on faci<:! 
swelling in these two subjects. The Applicant notes that Subject 833 had had a history 
of facial rashes and dry skin, and that facial swelling was accompanied by rash in this 
instance. A causative relationship to study drug was not established or ruled out, and 
a rechallenge was not attempted. Subject 844 had unilateral facial swelling, with a 
raised area on the buccal mucosa; four days later following the application of warm 
compresses, "oral drainage (pus)" was reported for this subject. 
It seems unlikely that facial swelling in these subjects is related to GCV treatment. 
F. Pharmacokinetics results. Please see Dr. Sekar's review. 
labelling Comments: Please see Chemistry and Biopharmaceutics reviews for comments. No 
modifications to the propose labelling need to be made based on the clinical review of the Application. 
Conclusions: In St .. dy GANS 2686, two subjects who had received the 500 mg dosage form of GCV 
were discontinued from the study because of severe facial swelling. No such adverse event was 
described in Study GANS 2636. It is considered unlikely that fa<:ial swelling is related to treatment 
with the 500 mg dosage form of GCV. No other safety concerns were identified. 
Recommendation: It is recommended that this Supplemental Application be approved.

REQUEST FOR CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
ASSESSMENT FOR GANCICLOVIR CAPSUl..ES, 500 MG 
(SUPPLEMENT TO NDA 21>-460) 
. .-
Pursuant lo Tiiie 21 CFR 25.24(c)(2), Syntex (U.S.A.) Inc., 3401 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, California, 
94304 requests a categorical exclusion from the requirement for the preparation of an environmental 
assessment for Ganciclovir Capsules, 500 mg. Under 21 CFR § 25.24(c)(2), a supplement to an 
NOA may be categorically excluded from the preparation of an Environmental Assessmc !lt "if the 
drug product will not be administered at higher dosage levels, for longer duration, of for different 
indications than were previously in effect and if data available to the agency do not establish that, at 
the expected levels of exposure, the substance may be toxic to organisms in the environment.• 
A 250 mg capsule formulation for oral administration of ganciclovir is cui:rently approved (NOA 20-
460) in the United States under the name Cytovene® (ganciclovir capsules). It was originally 
indicated for prevention of CMV disease in individuals with advanced HIV infection at risk of 
developing CMV disease, and also as an altematille to the IV formulation for maintenance treatment 
of CMV retinitis in immunocornpromised individuals, including individuals with AIDS. A supplement to 
NOA 20-460 for ihe additional indication of the prevention of CMV disease in solid organ transplant 
. recipients was approved by the FDA in November 1996 (Supplement #SE1-006). 
This Request for Categorical Exclusion from an Environmental Assessment Report is submitted 
in support of a supplement to NOA 20-450 for Ganciclovir Capsules, 500 mg. In this 
supplement, the only changes are increasing the ganciclOvir capsule dosage strength from 250 
mg to 500 mg, and the size anci color of the gelatin capsule. The proposed capsule is a #0 two­
piece hard gelatin capsule consisting of an opaque green body and yellow cap. It contains 
FD&C Blue #2, Yellow Iron Oxide, Titanium OXide, and Gelatin (the same ingredients as are ·' 
found in the 250 mg capsule). Although the dosage strength of the proposed 500 mg capsules 
is greater than the approved 250 mg capsules, the daily do.o;age of ganciclovir will not increase 
as fewer capsules will be administered; nor will the drug be administered for longer durations or 
for dilferent indications than already approved. Thus, the proposed action is not e~ected to 
result in an increase of production of ganciclovir and is therefore not expected to increase the 
amount of ganciclovir and its metabolites entering the environment through product use.
