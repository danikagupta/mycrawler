Abstract: The marine microorganism Planococcus sp.VITP21 from Kumta costal region of Karnataka, India 
was used as biosorbent for the sorpt ion of acidic industrial dye, Black TSB (BT). The adsorbent efficiency of 
the dye was studied by varying the different parameters such as pH, initial dye concentration, initial salt (NaCl) 
concentration and initial Cr (III) concentration. The isotherm stud ies were performed by agitating 0.5 gm (wet 
weight) of biomass with 50 ml of dye solution with different concentration (10 – 40 mg/l). The parameters were 
analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. On comparison, Freundlich was fo und 
best fitted with regression coefficient value of .99 and the maximum biosorption capacity was found to be 9.6 
mg/gm.  The FT -IR and SEM were also used for characterizing the biosorption process by Planococcus  sp. 
VITP21. The results showed that marine b iosorbent, Planococcus  sp. VITP21 has very good potential for 
removing acidic dye from aqueous solution under different operating conditions .

Introduction  
A huge amount of dyes containing waste water are generated from textile, paper, cosmetic, 
pharmaceutical or leather industry. These industrial effluents when released into the environment lead  to 
pollution and  affect human health1. The dye in corporated industrial effluents are one of the hardest wastewaters 
to be treated because of their high chemical and biological oxygen demand  2. The amount of dyestuff and dye 
intermediate production of the entire world is estimated to be about 7.108 kg per  annum3. Water effluents 
containing dyes have a very hazardous impact on environment and thus causing chronic and acute d iseases  4. 
Dyes  with unfavourable compound  like chlorides and aromatic compounds affect the photosynthetic ability by 
decreasing the li ght penetration power and also cause toxic ity to different aquatic life4. Different classes of dyes 
are used in industries namely anionic, cationic , reactive and direct dyes.  Anionic dyes are water soluble and 
bind covalently to the materials  and hence the y cannot b e removed easily by conventional treatment 
techniques5. They also differ from the other class es of dyes  because of their stable nature against heat, light, 
biodegradation and oxidizing agents5. Thus the  receiving water is destroyed and contaminat ed, urging for 
alternate treatment method s6. The conventional or physico chemical methods of dye removal are of low 
efficiency  and high operational cost but methods like adsorption and bio sorption has proved to be effective  
with high  adsorption capacity7.  Among the  various adsorbents available, activated carbons are one of the most 
competent methods  but the main disadvantage of using activated carbon is that it is not cost effective8. Bio 
sorption differs from adsorption in the way that the adsorbent mate rial being used is living or dead 
microorganism or its derivatives. Many biomasses were reported for biosorption such as Aspergillus niger9, 
Aspergillus foetidus10, Phanerochaete chrysosporium11 and Rhizopus arrhizus12. However biosorption by 
marine bacter ia have not been reported extensively though they have wider application for bioremediation of

dye effluent rich in NaCl. Henceforth in the present study an investigation was performed for biosorption of 
anionic industrial dye , Black TSB from aqueous solut ion by using marine bacteria, Planococcus  sp.VITP21  
under different operating conditions . 
Experimental  
Biosorbent  
 
Marine bacteria, Planococcus sp. VITP2113, an isolate from Kumta coast of Karnataka, India  was used 
as adsorbent in the present study.  Bacte rial culture  was grown for 24 hours in Luria Bertani media under 
optimal condition (35ºC , 7 pH, 120 rpm and 4 % w/v NaCl) , centrifuged  at 10000 rpm  for 15 minute and the 
biomass (pellet ) was used as biosorbent material . 0.5 gm (wet weight) of biosorbent was used in all t he studies  
for biosorption  of dye .  
 
Dye solution preparation  
 
 The acidic industrial dye , Black  TSB (Able Advanced Chemicals, Taiwan) was purchased from local 
shop and used for the present investigation.  The aqueous solution of dye  was prepared by dissolving 1 000 mg 
of appropriate dye in 1 litre of distilled water and used as stock solution for all the experiments.  
 
 Batch biosorption  experiment  
 
 The batch adsorption studies w ere carried out by treating 50  ml of dye solution with 500  mg (we t 
weight) of biomass in Erlenmeyer flask for 2 2 hours  of incubation at 120 rpm and 298 K  in an orbital shaker  for 
all the experiments.  The effect of pH on biosorption was  studied at 3, 5 , 7 and 9 pH  with initial dye 
concentration of 40 mg/l.  The effect of initial dye concentration (10 to 40 mg/l)  on biosorption and adsorption 
isotherm study for different initial dye concentration (10 to 4 0 mg/l) was carried out . The study on effect of 
different salt concentration  (2, 4, 6 and 8 % (w/v) NaCl) on biosorption of 40 mg/l of dye concentration  by 
biosorbent was investigated.  Cr (III) salt effect on biosorption of anionic dyes was studied in the presence of 
different doses of chromium ( 50,100,150 and 200 mg/l) for the removal of 40  mg/l of dye. Further a ll the 
experiments were carried out at pH 3 and pH was  adjusted using 0.1 N HCl and NaOH solutions, prior to 
addition of bio sorbent . U-2800 Spectrophotometer was used to determine the maximum wavelength for Black 
TSB and the wavelength was observed to be at 493nm for Black TSB14. The initial and  final absorbance was 
estimated  at 493nm,  after samples  were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15  minutes . The percentage  removal  of 
dye and amount  of dye  adsorbed (in mg/g)  were calculated using the following relationships:     
Percent Removal  = 
  
Amount adsorbed (q e) = 
  
Where C o and C e are the initial and the final dye concentration  (mg/l) respectively, m is the mass of biosorbent 
(mg/l).   
Scanning electron microscopy and FT-IR analysis  
 The morphology of t he surface  of biomass of Planococcus sp.VITP21 (biosorbent) before and after 
adsorption of dye were investigated15 using the scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS model).  FT-IR 
analysis  was done in a range of 500 -4000  cm-1 to identify the active sites p resent on the surface of the bio 
sorbent and their interaction16. The pure biosorbent and biosorbent loaded  with dye were dried at 50ºC for a 
time period of 24 h  and mixed with KBr and  spectrum was recorded17.

Results and Discussion  
Biosorption experim ent  
Effect of pH  
 pH is a n important factor  to increase the rate of sorption of industrial  dye, Black TSB  from the aqueous 
solution . The investigation on the effect of initial pH on biosorption was performed for pH 3 , 5, 7  and 9 with th e 
initial dye conc entration of 4 0 mg/l  (Figure  1). The resu lts showed that the maximum r emoval was 76 % at pH 
3 and from pH 5 to pH 9, remo val efficiency decreased from 7 5 to 69 % at equilibrium time of  22 hours. The 
possible reason for the effectiveness of the lower pH in the dye biosorption onto Planococcus sp.VITP21 
biosorbent m ay be due to the fact that at lower pH , more protons will be available for the protonation of the 
adsorbent surface which resulted in  increasing the electrostatic interaction between the positively  charged 
adsorbent sites and the negatively charged anionic dyes 18.

biosorbent, Planococcus  sp. VITP21 at 2980K. Condition: Time - 22 hours, agitation rate -120 rpm  
Effect of Initial dye concentration  
 
Figure 2:  Effect of initial dye concentration (10 - 50 mg/l) on biosorption of Black TSB by biosorbent, 
Planococcus  sp. VITP21 at 2980K. Condition: Time - 22 hours, pH 3, agitation speed -120rpm.    
The ef fect of initial dye concentration (10 to 40 mg/l) on biosorption of Black TSB is shown in figure  2. 
The amount of dye adsorbed per amount of adsorbent  (qe) value increased wit h increa se in dye concentration  
(10 to 40 mg/l) from 0.81  to 3.04 mg/g .  The adsorption capacities of biosorbent  increased because of an 
increase in the driving force associated with concentration gradient with an increase in initial dye 
concentrati on19, 20.        
Effect of different salt  concentration  
 The effect of var ying initial s alt concentration ( NaCl ) on percentage removal of dye was carried out by 
adding  different NaCl  concentration (2%, 4%, 6% and 8% (w/v )) to 40 mg/l of dye solution , Black T SB (Figure 
3). The experiment al results revealed that  the percent removal increased from 78 to 88% with the increasing salt 
concentration  (2 to 8% w/v) . The increas e in biosorption  under saline condition may be due to increase in ionic 
strength and the electrostatic interaction  16, 21.  Sangeetha Subramanian  et al /Int.J. ChemTech Res.2014,6(11),pp 4755 -4763. 4758

aqueous solution by biosorbent, Planococcus sp. VITP21 at 2980K. Condition: Time - 22 hours, pH 3, 
agitation speed - 120 rpm.  
Effect of different  chromium (III) concentration  
 
Figure 4 : Effect of init ial Chromium (III) concentration (50 -200 mg/l) on biosorption of Black TSB dye 
(40 mg/l) by biosorbent, Planococcus  sp. VITP21 at 2980K. Condition: Time - 22 hours, pH 3.  
The effect of different Cr (III) concentration (50,100,150  and 200 mg/l) on bio sorpt ion of B lack T SB 
dye (40 mg/l)  was carried out. The results show ed that the bio sorption decreased from 77% to 69% with 
increasing chromium (III) concentration  from 50  to 200  mg/l (Figure 4). The decrease in biosorption capacity in 
the presence of Cr (III) ions may be due to higher affinity of these ions on the dye binding sites of adsorbent 
material16.  
Adsorption isotherm studies   
Langmuir adsorption isotherm

VITP21 at 2980K. Condition  : Time - 22 hours, pH 3.  Sangeetha Subramanian  et al /Int.J. ChemTech Res.2014,6(11),pp 4755 -4763. 4759 
 
The theory of Langmuir  assumes the formation of saturated monolayer of adsorbate molecules on a 
surface  of adsorbent with no transmigration across the plane of the surface  and with constant adsorptio n 
energy23. The linearized  form for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm  is: 
 
Where C e is the solute concent ration (mg/ l) at equilibrium, q e is the amount of adsorbate which has 
been adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g), b is the Langmuir constant related to t he bi osorption energy ( l/mg), Q m is 
the maximum sorption capacity with complete monolayer coverage (mg/g).   The linear plot  of Ce/qe vs Ce  
shows that the adsorption of Black TSB  obeys Langmuir adsorption model with the R2 value of 9.6 (Figure 5). 
Qm (9.6 mg/g) and  b (0.05 l/mg) were  determined from the slope and the intercept of the plot and comparative 
adsorption capacity (Q m) of different biosorbents is given in table 1. The analysis of the Langmuir equation is 
done by estimating a dimensionless equilibrium pa rameter R L which is given by the expression  24,  
  
. The value of  RL is greater than zero and less than one, the adsorption is considered as f avourable  and if R L is 
equal to  1, linear adsorption takes place . Irreversible adsorption and unfavour able adsorption take place 
respectively when RL is equal to 0  and greater  than 1.The R L value for the B lack TSB is 0.34, which is between 
0 and 1 that refers the process as favourable 14, 25, 26 .

VITP21 at 2980K. Condition : Time - 22 hours, pH 3.  
For the study of heterogeneous  surface energy systems30, the Freundlich adsorption isotherm is used. 
The Freundlich equation assumes that concentration of dye on the surface of adsorbent will increase 
continuously as long as there is an increase in the dye concentration in the interaction medium31. The linearized 
form for the Freundlich isotherm is:  Sangeetha Subramanian  et al /Int.J. ChemTech Res.2014,6(11),pp 4755 -4763. 4760 
 
 
Where, Kf (l/mg) is the Freundlich constant and is re lated to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent4. 1/n is the 
measure of adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity and with the value ranging between 0 and 1 is said to 
be favourable6. K f and n is determined from the linear plot (R2  = 0.99) of log q e versus log C e (Figure 6 ). In the 
present study, K f  is  0.489 l/mg and 1/n is 0.8 which indicates a favourable adsorption. All the values are in 
accordance with the reported literature32. 
4.5.3 Temkin adsorption isotherm  
 
Figure 7: Temkin isotherm of bi osorption of Black TSB (10 - 40 mg/l) by biosorbent, Planococcus  
sp.VITP21 at 2980K. Condition : Time -22 hours, pH 3.  
The Temkin adsorption isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption increases linearly on a surface30 
and t he adsorption is assumed to be ch aracterized by uniformly distributed binding energies, up to some binding 
energy which is maxi mum33. The linearized form of Temkin   adsorption isotherms is :  
, where
 ,   At is the Temkin isotherm  equilibrium binding constant ( l/g), bt 
is the  Temkin constant related to heat of sorption (J/mol) , R is  universal gas constant (8.314J/mol  K), T (K) is 
absolute temperature .  The plot of q e versus ln C e  (R2 = 0.987) is used for calculating constant At  and B  (Figure 
7). The value of B is 1.381 J/mol  and A t is 0.89 l/gm  and the values obtained are in accordance with the 
litera ture 33, 34 and this shows that the adsorption is fitting well in T emkin isotherm . A positive value of b t 
(1794.04) indicates that the adsorption process is exothermi c35.

Figure 9: FTIR spectrum of (a) unadsorbed biosorbent, Planococcus  sp.VITP21 and (b) Black TSB 
adsorbed biosorbent, Planococcus  sp.VITP 21 
The SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) imaging revealed the morphological changes due to 
biosorption of Black TSB on the surface of biosorbent, Planococcus sp.VITP2136. Before adsorption, the 
spherical shaped clusters of cells were observed (Figure 8(a)) but after the adsorption, the surface completely 
flattened due to adsorption of Black TSB dye (figure 8(b)) as reported in the literature37. 
The FT -IR spectrum of unadsorbed and adsorbed biosorbent, Planococcus  sp.VITP21 with dyes, Black 
TSB was performe d to understand the possible biosorbent -dye interaction (Figure 9). Table 2 shows the 
corresponding functional group of IR frequencies. The shift in the band region 3352.28, 2964.59, 2875.86, 
1631.78 and 1068.56 indicates the stretching vibration of differ ent functional group, N -H, O -H, CH 3, C=O and 
C-O due to interaction with the dye (17, 39 and 40). P=O, P -O-C and P -OH stretching was also observed in the 
region of 933.5538.
