11  Burke and Montevecchi, 2009.Marine birds, also known as seabirds, are a loosely 
defined group of birds that differ greatly from their 
terrestrial relatives. These birds spend a significant 
amount of time, often nearly their whole lives, at sea 
or in coastal marine environments.1 Bird species from 
nine orders (Procellariiformes, Sphenisciformes, 
Gaviiformes, Podicipidiformes, Anseriformes, 
Phaethontiformes, Charadriiformes, Pelecaniformes 
and Suliformes) are considered marine birds. 
Shorebirds, those living in the coastal littoral zone, 
are typically not called marine birds.2 Despite the fact 
that these birds account for such a small proportion of 
all bird species, approximately 3.5 per cent,3 their role 
in marine ecosystems and environmental monitoring 
of those ecosystems is critically important.4 
Marine birds have adapted several unique features 
for life in the marine environment that set them 
apart from passerines and other birds that make 
their homes on land. Their life histories, behaviour 
and physiology are different from their terrestrial 
relatives, although these factors also vary between 
families of marine birds.5 Unlike passerines, marine 
birds are long-lived and reach sexual maturity at a 
later age. They also have lower reproductive rates, 
meaning they have small clutch sizes or lay few 
eggs.6 Except for a few groups, such as cormorants, 
marine birds have also evolved “waterproof” plumage 
that allows them to forage and dive in the marine 
environment in ways other groups of birds cannot.7 
Species of marine birds can dive to different depths, 
depending on their weight and other physiological factors, which allows them to exploit different niches 
within the marine environment.8 Marine birds also 
have salt glands that enable them to drink saltwater 
and excrete the salt later.9 Behaviourally, marine 
birds differ from other groups because they nest in 
colonies with other birds. This colonial lifestyle allows 
birds to mitigate some of the risks of predation and to 
interact socially to mate and to pass on information 
regarding food availability.10 Marine birds can fly long 
distances for migration and feeding. However, during 
breeding, marine birds are restricted because they are 
central place foragers and must return to the colony 
to feed their offspring.11

15  Zwolicki, et al., 2012.Despite their diversity, the ecological services 
provided by marine birds are very similar. As top 
trophic level consumers,12 marine birds facilitate  
energy and nutrient transfer from the lower trophic 
levels and among different environments.13 Each year, 
marine birds eat approximately 70 to 100 million 
tonnes of food globally, most of which is zooplankton 
and fish.14 Since marine birds feed at sea and spend time in colonies on land, these birds transfer 
nutrients from sea to land in the form of guano. 
This helps to enrich soils, eventually increasing 
biodiversity as well as primary and secondary 
production. These processes are particularly well 
studied and important in arctic and Antarctic 
ecosystems, where this transfer of nutrients is 
invaluable.15

24  Votier and Sherley, 2017.In addition to enriching soils, marine birds are 
also an important source of information for many 
scientists. As top predators, marine birds are often 
used as indicators of pollution, environmental 
change and other issues further down the food 
chain. Compared to other marine organisms, marine 
birds are relatively easy to observe because of their 
larger size and abundancy. These factors, along 
with the fact that they are long-lived, makes them 
an ideal study subject for some scientists.16 The low 
reproductive rates and long lifespans of marine birds 
pose a challenge for scientists because these factors 
mean that their response to environmental change 
is slow.17 In recent years, marine birds have been the 
messengers of bad news regarding climate change. 
Massive die-offs of species like the common murre 
(Uria aalge) have brought attention to the impacts 
that warming waters and the lack of ice cover in 
northern regions have on marine species.18
For a group that is known to be ecologically 
important, surprisingly little is known about the 
behaviour of marine birds and how it may be 
impacted by human activities.19 Literature focus 
on the group is still sparse, with only a few studies 
focusing on anthropogenic impacts. This may be 
due to the logistical challenges associated with 
studying these impacts. Many marine bird species 
are migratory, making it difficult to track individuals 
and determine when and where exposure to harmful 
environmental impacts may have occurred.20 
Additionally, changes in populations of marine birds 
are difficult to quantify. In tropical islands, marine 
birds breed on land and feed in the surrounding 
waters. Despite the pleasant climates, it is challenging 
to track birds to their specific colonies and collect 
quantitative data on these islands’ populations.21 
In Arctic regions, logistical issues caused by the 
remoteness and large area covered by marine birds 
has lead to patchy information regarding abundance 
and distribution.22 The issues scientists face while studying marine 
birds are especially concerning considering the many 
threats humans pose to the group. Fishing, poaching, 
habitat loss, guano collection, chemical pollution, 
marine debris, shipping, oil spills and introduced 
species are all anthropogenic impacts that threaten 
marine birds.23 Because marine birds are some of 
the most threatened avian species, with monitored 
populations worldwide declining by approximately 
70 per cent between 1950 and 2010,24 examining how 
human disturbances impact this group is now more 
important than ever. 6

37  Morandin and O’Hara, 2016; NOAA, 2015.Impacts on behaviour are one of the many ways 
in which shipping can disturb marine birds.25 
Physiology, reproductive behaviour and success, and 
population trends may be impacted in the long term,26 
while foraging success, energy stores and chick-
rearing could be impacted in the short term.27 These 
impacts’ existence is known to scientists, but they 
are generally not well understood. Basic information 
about the impacts that passing ships can have on bird 
species, such as flight reactions, distribution patterns and habitat loss, is seldom quantified, even for those 
bird species known to be sensitive to anthropogenic 
disturbances.28 Those studies that do exist typically 
examine how these activities impact marine bird 
behaviour and physiology across temporal scales, but 
often focus on a single species.29 The sections below 
discuss the various ways in which vessels impact 
marine birds, and Table 1 provides a summary of  
this information.  
OILING
Oil spills of all magnitudes occur in the marine 
environment. Large scale oil spills have huge far-
reaching impacts that often receive media attention 
and are well-documented.30 Chronic oiling is less 
noticeable as it happens slowly over time with 
smaller amounts of oil being released; however, the 
impacts may be comparable to those of large-scale 
spills.31 Oil enters the marine environment through 
several channels. Natural petroleum seeps, leaking 
shipwrecks and bilge cleaning (legal and illegal) 
contribute to chronic oiling,32 while grounding, 
collisions and allisions, and equipment failures are 
typically responsible for larger oil-spill events.33 
Marine organisms are impacted by oiling, especially 
those in areas surrounding ports, refineries, vessel routes, oil terminals and oil rigs, where the spill risk 
is high.34 Marine birds are the most prominent and 
abundant group killed or injured by oiling.35
Physiology and oiling 
Marine birds spend much of their lives foraging at 
sea and sitting on the water surface. This makes 
them particularly vulnerable to oil spills, as do some 
aspects of their physiology.36 Most marine birds 
have a special feather microstructure that traps air 
between their feathers and skin, keeping them dry 
and warm.37 Marine birds have adapted this special 
feature specifically to keep water out. When they 
encounter polluted water, which has  7
REDUCING IMPACTS FROM SHIPPING IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: A TOOLKIT FOR CANADAa different surface tension than nonpolluted water, 
the interlocking barbs, barbules and hooks that 
keep water away from the bird’s skin collapse. This 
can lead to heat loss, impacting the bird’s ability 
to thermoregulate and stay buoyant, potentially 
leading to hypothermia and death.38 Birds may 
unintentionally dive into oil slicks while searching 
for food or inhale toxic fumes, which could lead to 
lung issues.39 These physical impacts are often caused 
by heavy oils like crude oil. But lighter oils that are 
more soluble and have more volatile components 
can also be very harmful to birds. If these oils are 
inhaled, ingested via contaminated food or water or 
make contact with a bird’s skin, they can be absorbed 
and cause many non-lethal effects, including liver 
damage and reduced viability of eggs.40 These oils 
may also increase mortality rates and have long-term 
impacts on populations.41 Finally, birds may attempt 
to fly to land to dry their feathers after becoming 
oiled. A combination of drying feathers and preening 
to remove oil may be successful for some birds; 
however, birds also risk becoming poisoned  
by ingesting oil during preening.42 Flying to land to 
dry off also has consequences for marine birds. This 
time spent on land reduces the time available for 
breeding and feeding, and also increases the risks  
of predation.43
Susceptibility to oiling 
While the impacts of oiling are a threat to all marine 
birds, the life histories and feeding habitats of 
some species make them more vulnerable. Diving 
auks such as thick-billed murres ( Uria lomvia ), 
common murres and dovekies ( Alle alle) forage on 
the surface of the water, making them vulnerable to 
oiling.44 Pelagic birds are also vulnerable to this type 
of disturbance because of their life history. These 
birds are slow to mature, meaning they experience 
a long juvenile stage followed by high survivorship

50  Ibid.during adulthood and low reproductive output. This 
combination of factors can result in a slower recovery 
from oil spills.45 
In addition to certain marine bird biological factors, 
there are also behavioural factors that may make 
some species more sensitive to oiling.46 For example, 
birds like the common murre float in large groups 
called rafts. These rafts may include up to 250,000 
birds. If an oil spill occurs near a raft, the birds may 
unknowingly float into oil, which could impact many 
birds at once. This kind of occurrence is not unusual 
for common murres as their habitat often overlaps 
with busy shipping channels. Of the approximately 
30,000 dead oiled birds collected in Alaska’s Prince 
William Sound following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 
1989, around three-quarters (or more than 22,000) 
were common murres.47 Although the sensitivity 
of some species, like the common murre, to oiling 
is well-documented, limited information exists on 
the sensitivity of many other marine birds to oiling. 
Therefore, more research is necessary to determine 
the risks that oiling events pose to bird species and 
marine ecosystems as a whole.48 
Chronic oiling
Despite not knowing how sensitive many marine 
bird species are to oiling, the evidence that chronic 
oiling is occurring worldwide has been documented 
for decades. In the North Sea, nearly all of the bird 
carcasses that washed up on shore in the 1950s 
and 1960s were contaminated with mineral oil in 
some way.49 Beached bird surveys were organized 
following this discovery to bring attention to the issue 
and push managers and policymakers to intervene. 
Despite the decrease in the number of oiled birds 
being detected, chronic oiling still occurs in the 
region.50 More recently, scientists have estimated 
that approximately 300,000 seabirds are killed off 8
REDUCING IMPACTS FROM SHIPPING IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: A TOOLKIT FOR CANADAthe coast of Newfoundland each year due to chronic 
oiling.51 Additionally, there is still evidence of ships 
deliberately discharging oil and bilge waters in the 
North Sea, despite regulatory restrictions.52 While 
there are a few exceptions, for example, off the coast 
of California where natural seeps occur because 
of the geology of the area, discharge of oiled water 
from ships at sea is thought to be the main source 
of chronic oiling globally.53 Although beached

62  Schwemmer, et al., 2011.bird surveys have triggered policy responses and 
monitoring programs in many regions,54 the literature 
suggests that ship operators often still fail to comply 
with these regulations and simply discharge oil 
in remote areas or at times when enforcement is 
lacking.55 This is concerning given the lethality of 
small spills and chronic oiling,56 and the populations’ 
susceptibility to the impacts of large-scale stressors 
such as climate change.57
SHIP TRAFFIC
Flush distance measures how close a source of 
anthropogenic disturbance can get to a bird before 
they flush, or flee.58 It is often measured by scientists 
to determine how sensitive a species is to ship traffic, 
and the gathered information may be used to inform 
management and policy decisions that aim to protect 
especially sensitive species and areas.59 Several factors 
seem to impact flush distance;60 however, the subject 
is not highly studied, and existing studies have often 
focused on only one species and only at a certain 
time of the year61 or flush distance in freshwater 
environments.62 Nonetheless, flush distance is still 
likely the most studied impact that shipping has on 
the behaviour of marine birds. 
Flush distance
In their 2011 study, Schwemmer and colleagues 
explored the impacts that ship traffic has on the 
distribution of marine birds, the flush distances of 
sensitive marine bird species, the long- and short-
term impacts of flushing on habitat use and the 
habituation of marine birds in response to shipping 
traffic. To examine these impacts, the researchers 
studied species known to be sensitive to ship traffic. 
The study species included red-throated loons ( Gavia 
stellate), black-throated loons ( G. arctica ), common 
eiders ( Somateria mollissima ), long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis ), common scoters ( Melanitta 
nigra) and white-winged scoters ( M. deglandi), all 
found in regions of the German North Sea and Baltic 
Sea with highly concentrated shipping activity. By 
measuring flushing distance of these bird species, 
Schwemmer and colleagues found that the reaction 
of birds varied within and between species. Species 
found to have high levels of intraspecific variability 
in flush distance detected in the study were likely 
influenced by environmental factors and flock size. 
Individuals situated within larger flocks are likely to 
flush sooner than those in smaller flocks, as flocks 
tend to flee in response to the flight of their most 
sensitive individuals. The larger the flock size, the 
more likely it is that highly sensitive individuals  
are present.
Additionally, flock location, inside or outside of 
shipping lanes, significantly affected flush distance. 
Flocks observed in the shipping lanes had shorter 
flush distances, suggesting habituation to shipping 
traffic. Sea state also impacted flush distance, with 
distances decreasing as wave action increased for 
some of the observed common scoters and long-
tailed ducks observed. This may be because higher 
sea states make it more difficult for birds to see 
oncoming ship traffic or because it is often easier for 
marine birds to take off due to the stronger winds 9
REDUCING IMPACTS FROM SHIPPING IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: A TOOLKIT FOR CANADAthat often accompany a higher sea state. Other 
factors, like molting, may also impact flush distance. 
Temporary habitat loss occurred following flushing, 
which is likely to have energetic implications because 
of the energy necessary to flee from ship traffic and 
foraging time lost. The researchers concluded that 
more studies should be undertaken to examine the 
flush distances for other species, differences between 
seasons and the impacts that speed and noise may 
have on marine birds.63  
Changes in distribution
In addition to measuring flush distance to determine 
the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on marine 
birds, changes in distribution may also be used as 
an indicator of disturbance. For example, Agness 
and colleagues examined the impacts of shipping on 
Kittlitz’s murrelet ( Brachyramphus brevirostris ) 
in 2008 by examining how density, group size and 
behaviours are impacted by vessel disturbance. The 
authors suggest that this species may be particularly 
sensitive to disturbances due to their high wing 
loading, making the flight more energetically costly 
for many species of the Auk family. Researchers 
observed birds raising chicks and those that were not 
to determine whether the energetically demanding 
task of chick-rearing impacted the birds’ response to 
vessel activity. Although vessel traffic did impact the 
density of Kittlitz’s murrelets near shore, researchers 
found that environmental and biological factors 
overall had more influence on density, group size 
and behaviours. Researchers also found that group 
size was not influenced by vessel activity, so group 
dynamics were not impacted. Their behaviour was 
impacted on days when ship traffic was higher. When 
vessel activity was greater, researchers observed 
Kittlitz’s murrelets diving three times more than 
usual. However, this behavioural response that may 
have been intended to help the birds with energy 
recovery (lost during increased flight) would only be 
beneficial if the diving resulted in their catching prey. 
In addition, researchers observed that flight response 
also went up more than 30-fold with increased vessel 
activity, which could prove very harmful for a species 
whose flight is so energetically costly. Birds carrying 
63  Ibid.

65		Bellefleur,	et	al.,	2009.
66  Ibid.
67  Ibid.fish to feed to their young were found to continue 
to rest on the sea surface as vessels approached, 
with only 1 per cent of fish-holders fleeing from 
approaching vessels. Individuals not carrying fish had 
the greatest flight response from large vessels. Vessel 
speed and size also had impacts on these behavioural 
responses of Kittlitz’s murrelets. In particular, vessels 
approaching at fast and moderate speeds caused  
95 per cent of fish-holding birds to dive, fleeing from 
vessels, a behaviour not observed in fish-holders 
when vessels were not present.64 
Recreational boating 
Similar to Agness and colleagues’ study in 2008, in 
2009, Bellefleur and colleagues examined the impacts 
of recreational boat traffic on marbled murrelets ( B. 
marmoratus ) in the waters surrounding the Pacific 
Rim National Park Reserve in British Columbia. 
Although recreational vessel traffic is different from 
commercial shipping, some parallels can be drawn 
between them. The researchers sought to determine 
the flush distance of marbled murrelets at different 
times of day, during different seasons, at various ages 
and when boats approached at different speeds. They 
found that when approached by recreational boats, 
most of the murrelets dove to avoid the watercraft 
and resurfaced nearby. If the murrelets decided to 
fly away instead, they typically left the feeding area 
entirely.65 As was found in the study conducted  
by Agness and colleagues in 2008, the type of boat 
and its speed and approach impacted the behavioural 
response of the birds, with faster boats resulting in 
an increase in flushing behaviour.66 The marbled 
murrelets demonstrated some degree of habituation 
to vessels in areas where boat traffic was concentrated 
as flush distance decreased by approximately five 
metres, but overall flushing behaviour increased in 
these areas by around 17 per cent.67 10

77  Davies, et al., 2014.Marine mammals are negatively impacted by the 
underwater noise associated with shipping, but 
the impacts of noise on marine birds are virtually 
unknown.68 The majority of marine birds use sight to 
find prey while diving;69 however, some birds dive to 
depths where little light is available or frequently dive 
at night, which suggests that they are likely to rely 
on senses other than vision. Additionally, hearing is 
important for many birds in the air and while in their 
colonies. Emperor penguins ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) 
and king penguins ( A. patagonicus ) find their 
partners in large, noisy colonies by using distinctive 
sounds, a process that may be negatively impacted by 
nearby noise.70 Research in the high Arctic also shows 
that fish populations, such as arctic cod, are disturbed 
and displaced by vessel noise, which is problematic 
for the marine birds, such as black guillemots 
(Cepphus grylle) and northern fulmars ( Fulmarus 
glacialis), that prey upon them.71 Finally, the noise 
generated by offshore windfarms may cause marine 
birds to avoid the turbines and area surrounding them, though little is known about this behaviour or 
its possible repercussions.72
Despite the lack of research about the effects 
of acoustic disturbance caused by shipping on 
marine birds, Dooling and Therrien postulate in 
their 2012 study that the impacts are likely similar 
to how land birds and other marine vertebrates 
experience acoustic disturbance. The researchers 
note that birds in the air are known to be sensitive 
to continuous noise exposure and blast noise, both 
of which can cause physical damage to the auditory 
system. Noise above certain levels can also mask 
communication between birds. Levels that are too 
low to mask communication could still result in 
harmful behavioural and physiological impacts. 
The importance of further research specific to 
diving birds to determine whether they use sound 
to communicate, forage and avoid predators 
underwater, and how these activities may be impacted 
by anthropogenic noise, cannot be overemphasized.73
LIGHT POLLUTION
Artificial light from offshore oil and gas rigs and 
offshore wind farms are known to have negative 
impacts on marine birds.74  Shipping also causes light 
pollution in the marine environment, but its impacts 
are not as well documented in the literature. The 
studies that discuss the impacts of light from ships 
emphasize the dangers of collisions with ships or 
structures. Marine birds may become disoriented by 
marine light pollution or be attracted to artificial light when visibility is low, leading to collisions.75 These 
collisions are especially common during migration 
and in the winter.76 Comparisons may be made with 
land birds, which are negatively impacted by artificial 
light. In addition to an increased risk of predation, 
land birds are also known to reach sexual maturity 
faster, forage more intensely and extend their dawn 
song as a result of artificial light.77  11

REDUCING IMPACTS FROM SHIPPING IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: A TOOLKIT FOR CANADAFUTURE RESEARCH

101  Ibid.The studies mentioned above contribute to our knowledge of the impacts of shipping on marine birds. But they 
are not truly representative of the many natural and human-caused pressures faced by marine birds, because 
they only focus on the impacts of a single stressor on a single species. Most of these studies do not consider 
the cumulative effects of anthropogenic stressors on marine bird populations.99 Due to the lack of knowledge 
about the impacts of ship traffic on marine birds and other marine organisms, it is thought that managers 
cannot create effective spatial plans and conservation measures.100 However, because many marine birds are 
of conservation concern, future studies need to address the cumulative effects of anthropogenic impacts on 
marine birds to aid in better marine planning.10113
