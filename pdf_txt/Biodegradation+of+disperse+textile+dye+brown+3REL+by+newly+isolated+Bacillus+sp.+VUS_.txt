Abstract  
Decolorization of Disperse textile dye Brown 21, a very important commercial dye in textile industries  was investigated. A 
dye decolorizing bacterium was isolated from efflue nt collected from a GIDC, Pandesara, Surat, India. Various 
physicochemical parameters like pH, temperature, ca rbon sources and nitrogen sources were optimized fo r maximum 
decolorization of dye. Dye decolorization was obser ved in the range of pH 7.0 to 10.0. Temperature ran ges from 25˚C -
39˚C was observed as suitable temperature for dye d ecolorization. The dye was decolorized more than 90 % in aerobic 
culture conditions. The dye can be used as sole sou rce carbon and energy for cell growth. Additional c arbon source 
glucose increases the rate of dye decolorization. A ddition of urea also has increased the rate of dye decolorization. These 
results suggest that isolated bacterium, Enterobact er gergoviae, is suitable for the biological treatm ent of dye-containing 
wastewater. 
 
Keywords : Decolorization, wastewater, disperse dye,  enterobacter gergoviae , textile effluent. 
 
Introduction 
Water is considered as a rare and valuable commodit y, and only 
an minuscule part of the earth’s water reserves (ap proximately 
0.03%) constitutes the water resource that is avail able for 
human activities and considering growth of the worl d’s 
population, industry and its demand is more than th e supply 
available 1. The textile industry plays an important role in t he 
world economy as well as in our daily life. Textile  industries 
consumes huge amount of water and at the end produc e highly 
colored effluents 2. Extensive use of organic dyes in textile 
activities lead to the environmental problems 3-5. It is estimated 
that 10%-15% of the dyes are released in the enviro nment 
during the dyeing process. The two major sources of  release of 
dyes in to the environment are the effluents from t extile 
processing units and dyestuff manufacturing industr ies 3. Excess 
dyestuff in wastewater is highly objectionable beca use of 
ecological concerns 6,  health hazards and aesthetical aspects 7. 
Color is the first contaminant in the wastewater, w hich should 
be recognized and has to be removed before it disch arged in to 
the environment 8. Much research has been focused on chemical 
and physical removal of dyes from the wastewater. H owever, 
many of these technologies are cost prohibitive and  therefore 
are not viable option for treating large waste stre ams 3,4. 
Biological processes represent eco-friendly and cos t competitive 
alternatives to abiotic treatments 8,9,10 . Many laboratories have 
investigated the capacity of bacteria, fungi, and a lgae in 
removing the color of dyes. However, it is difficul t to keep them 
in functional form in the activated sludge systems,  due to their 
special nutritional requirements and environmental conditions. 
Moreover, bacterial degradation is much faster than  fungal 
degradation of textile dyeing effluents 7. The ability of microorganisms to carryout dye decolorization has r ecently 
received much attention. Microbial decolorization o f dyes is a 
cost effective method from removing them from the 
wastewater 1, 11 . Textile industry is among the most important 
industrial sector where disperse dyes are frequentl y used for 
dyeing of polyester fabrics 12,13 . The goals of present study were 
to isolate efficient dye decolorizing bacteria and optimize 
various parameters for dye decolorization. For this  study 
Disperse Brown 21 dye was used as a model dye.  
 
Material and Methods  
Disperse dye and chemicals: Disperse Brown 21 dye was 
procured from local market in Surat, India. The var ious 
chemicals used in this study were of analytical gra de and 
procured from Hi-Media Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. 
 
Isolation and identification of microbial culture: Highly 
colored textile effluent from a dyeing unit, in the  GIDC, 
Pandesara, Surat, India, was collected for isolatio n of dye 
decolorizing bacteria. The pH of effluent was 7.5. The effluent 
was collected in airtight sterile plastic container  and filtered 
through ordinary filter paper to remove large suspe nded 
particles. The effluent sample was inoculated with 50 mg l -1 of 
disperse brown 21 and incubated on rotary shaker (1 00 rpm) at 
30°C. After 24 h 5% of inoculum was transferred to fresh 
effluent along with disperse brown 21. Three such t ransfers 
were made. After third transfer cell suspension fro m last 
enriched flask was plated on the Bushnell Hass (BH)  agar 
medium for screening of dye decolorizing microorgan ism.

colonies were selected on the basis of formation of  
decolorization zone surrounding the colonies. Out o f those five 
colonies, most promising bacterial colony was selec ted on its 
capacity to produce largest decolorization zone on BH agar 
plate containing dye. The isolated bacteria were ch aracterized 
by various morphological and biochemical test accor ding to 
Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology 14 . 
 
Dye decolorization experiments: Dye decolorization by 
isolated bacterium was tested in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 
100 ml BH Medium containing 200 mg l -1 of dye. The sterilized 
medium was inoculated with the isolated bacterial c ulture of 
uniform cell density (1.0 optical density (OD) at 5 50 nm). The 
medium-to-inoculum ratio (v/v) was 50:1. Inoculated  medium 
was incubated at 30°C on rotary shaker (100 rpm). A fter 24 h of 
incubation, 3 ml of medium was withdrawn. Aliquot w as 
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to separate ce ll mass, clear 
supernatant was used to measure the decolorization at 
absorbance maxima of dye (471 nm) using spectrophot ometer 
(UV 2400 series, Shimadzu). Uninoculated medium was  
incubated as a control to check abiotic decolorizat ion. 
Experiment was performed in triplicate. Decolorizat ion 
efficiency was expressed as percentage of decoloriz ation and 
was calculated using equation, 
Decolorization (%) = A C - A T / A C X 100 
 
Where A C is the absorbance of the control and A T is average 
absorbance of the test samples. 
 
To ensure that the change in pH of the dye solution  had no 
effect on the decolorization, the visible spectrum was recorded 
between pH 5.0 to 11.0, in which the pH did not sho w any effect 
in spectrum. 
 
Optimization of condition for maximum decolorizatio n: 
Effect of different carbon sources on decolorizatio n: Three 
different carbon sources, i.e. glucose, lactose and  sucrose, were 
tested for decolorization at various concentration i.e. 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0% (w/v). 2 ml of inoculum was inoculated i n 100 ml 
BH medium along with dye and different concentratio n of 
carbon source. All flasks were incubated at 30°C on  rotary 
shaker. Aliquot was removed for the determination o f 
decolorizing activity at different time intervals. 
 
Effect of nitrogen sources on decolorization: Two nitrogen 
sources were tested for decolorization of dye. The concentration 
of organic nitrogen (urea) and inorganic nitrogen s ource 
(ammonium chloride) were 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0% (w/v). 2 ml of 
inoculum was added to 100 ml of BH medium along wit h dye, 
0.5% glucose and different concentration of nitroge n source. All 
flasks were incubated at 30°C on rotary shaker. Ali quot was 
removed for the determination of decolorizing activ ity at 
different time intervals. 
 
Effect of pH and temperature on decolorization: Effect of pH 
and temperature decolorization was observed by grow ing the 
isolate in the BH medium containing dye having pH r ange from 
pH 5.0 to 11.0. in the same way the effect of tempe rature was 
examined by growing cultures at  25°C, 27°C, 29°C, 31°C, 
33°C, 35°C, 37°C, 39°C, 41°C by keeping the pH of t he 
medium 7.4 for 7 days. Samples were withdrawn at di fferent 
time intervals and decolorizing activity was determ ined. 
 
Results and Discussion  
From the effluent sample, collected from a dyeing u nit, a 
promising decolorizing bacterial strain was isolate d. This strain 
formed a distinct clear decolorization zone on BH a gar plate 
containing dye. This screening method is also carri ed out by 
many author15,16 . For identification of this bacterium, we 
investigated its morphological and physiological pr operties 
using various biochemical media. On the basis of re sults the 
isolate was identified as Enterobacter gergoviae . (table 1). 
Some of the similar bacteria were also reported as dye 
decolorizer like Enterobacter  sp. EC3 17 , Enterococcus 
gallinarum 18 , Enterococcus faecalis 19 , and Enterobacter 
agglomerans 20 .

 International Science Congress Association             33  Microbial decolorization: The isolated strain was tested for its 
capacity to remove dye disperse brown 21. Dye was a dded as 
sole source of carbon and nitrogen to BH medium at 
concentration of 200 mg l -1. The results indicate that the strain is 
capable of decolorizing the dye up to 93% in 7 days . Disperse 
brown 3 REL was decolorized up to 86% by Brevibacillus 
laterosporus, an aerobic and spore forming bacterium 21  while it 
was decolorized 100% in optimized anoxic condition 22 . 
Decolorization of dye is depicted in figure-1. The result shows 
that the strain is effective in decolorization.

Optimization of culture condition: For the maximization of 
decolorization of the dye by the isolated strain, e xperiments 
were conducted for the optimization of carbon sourc e, nitrogen 
source, pH and temperature. 
 
Effect of different carbon sources: Three different carbon 
sources, glucose, lactose and sucrose, were tested for maximum 
decolorization by the isolated strain. Each carbon sources were 
added at 0.2%, 0.5%, and 1.0% in BH medium containi ng dye 
200 mg l -1. 
 
The strain is capable of decolorizing the dye in th e presence of 
glucose at various concentrations. The highest deco lorization 
observed when there was addition of 0.5% of glucose  as shown 
in figure-2. Our findings are supporting the result  that the 
optimum Cibacron Red FN-2BL dye decolorization was 
achieved when basal media was supplemented with add itional 
glucose 23 . 
 
There was no increase in the rate of decolorization  when lactose 
and sucrose added as shown in figure 3 and 4. Maxim um 
percentage decolorization was observed when glucose  used as 
carbon source at 0.5%.

Effect of different nitrogen sources: Two nitrogen sources, 
urea and ammonium chloride, were tested for decolor ization of 
dye by the isolated strain, results of which depict ed in figure 5 
and 6. BH medium containing dye was supplemented wi th 0.5% 
and 0.2%., 0.5%, and 1.0% of urea and ammonium chlo ride. 
Results suggest that strain showed maximum decolori zation at 
concentration 0.2% of urea and 0.2% of ammonium chl oride. 
The best decolorization was observed at 0.2% of amm onium 
chloride. Chen et al . reported that additional nitrogen source has 
strong effect on dye decolorization. In their study  on Red RBN 
dye they reported that dye decolorization was enhan ced when 
nitrogen sources were added in basal medium 24 . Jain et. al . also 
reported the same phenomena 25 .

Effect of temperature and pH on dye decolorization:  The 
effect of temperature and pH on the dye decolorizat ion was 
tested. It was found that a temperature of 31°C was  optimum for 
maximum decolorization as shown in figure-7. Simila r results 
were observed that Bacillus megaterium  can decolorize dye at 
37°C 26 . Decline in decolorization activity at higher temp erature 
more than 39°C can be due to the loss of cell viabi lity. Optimum 
pH for maximum dye decolorization was observed 7.0 as depicted in figure-8. pH and temperature play very important 
role in decolorization of Red 3BN by various fungi 27 .

Conclusion  
The present study has resulted in the isolation of a bacterial 
strain that has capacity of decolorizing disperse a zo dye and 
thus show the potential to be exploited as possible  candidate for 
bioremediation. Decolorization activity can be enha nced by 
addition of glucose. The isolated strain can decolo rize disperse 
dye under wide range of pH and temperature, which i s the 
nature of effluent from dyeing industries.
