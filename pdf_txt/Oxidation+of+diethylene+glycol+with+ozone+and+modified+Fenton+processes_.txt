Abstract 23
The use of glycols is seen in various industries and occupations. In past decades, 24
health implications from inhalable glycols have gained public attention. Inhalable 25
glycols may cause adverse health effects, especially for workers in occupations receiving 26
frequent exposure and consumers of glycol-based daily products. Our previous work 27
highlighted the rapid accumulation of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde in fog juice, 28
thus proposing the occurrence of glycol autoxidation. However, the fundamentals of 29
glycol autoxidation remained unclear and unexplored. Our goal is to investigate the 30
autoxidation of common glycols during indoor storage. Carbonyls were quantified using 31
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and peroxides from autoxidation 32
were monitored via iodometry and UV-Vis spectrometry. The impact of certain factors 33
such as the water mixing ratio, and antioxidants (Vitamin C) was also investigated. 34
Formation of aldehydes in many glycols was weekly monitored, such as E-cigarette 35
juice and triethylene glycol (TEG). Occurrence of autoxidation was confirmed by the 36
rise in the total peroxide concentration. Additionally, we highlighted the dependence 37
2of carbonyl formation rate on the TEG-water mixing ratio, demonstrating the complex 38
role water in glycol autoxidation. We have also tested the effectiveness of Vitamin C, 39
with suggestions for minimizing the formation of toxic carbonyls in consumer products. 40
Introduction 41
Glycols, or diols, are families of alcohols that have two hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to 42
an aliphatic carbon chain. By having different lengths of the carbon chain, every glycol has 43
its unique physical and chemical properties that make them useful in various industries and 44
daily products. Due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, glycol molecules have very 45
strong intermolecular forces, which give rise to their low volatility and high viscosity. Con- 46
ventionally, glycols are found in liquid or gel-like products, such as engine coolants,1drug 47
delivery media,2food additives,3as well as antifreeze or dehydrators.4Recently, growing de- 48
mand for glycols has been found in volatile organic compound-generating (VOC-generating) 49
or inhalable products. Ethylene glycol (EG), diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol 50
(TEG), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are common constituents in products including wall 51
paints,5artificial fog juice,6and perfumes. Glycerol (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) are 52
mostly seen in food or drug additives, solvents of personal care products, and E-cigarette 53
juice.7–10Especially, as the indoor environment becomes where people spend the majority of 54
their daily life, the aforementioned inhalable products could lead to elevated human exposure 55
to glycols and potentially other harmful compounds, leaving a strong implication for indoor 56
air quality. Especially for occupations under frequent glycol exposure, the adverse health 57
effects and productivity loss due to elevated indoor air pollutants could be significant.11,1258
With the development of the entertainment industry and vaping industry in recent 59
decades,13individual and public health implications of inhalable glycols have garnered more 60
attention from consumers and researchers. Since the early 2000s, a few studies proposed that 61
stage actors may experience adverse health effects due to the high exposure of glycols in ar- 62
tificial fog.14,15Wieslander et al. discovered that exposure to propylene glycol mist during 63
3aviation training would cause respiratory system-related symptoms.16However, not many 64
studies have addressed the origin of the health impact of glycol exposure in the following 65
decade. In the past years, emerging e-cigarette and vaping-associated lung injuries (EVALI) 66
became a serious health concern among the young population in North America.17,18Many e- 67
cigarette-related studies have proposed that the thermal degradation of glycol in e-cigarette 68
juice will produce various toxic aldehydes, such as formaldehyde.19,20The degradation is 69
found under high-temperature settings of the heating coil.21,22Thermal degradation may 70
not be the only cause of the carbonyls in glycols, as carbonyls were also discovered under 71
milder coil temperatures.23Meanwhile, studies also proposed aldehyde formation from au- 72
toxidation of poly-glycols,24–26but no subsequent research has been systematically carried 73
out since then. Consequently, the potential of various glycols forming toxic compounds 74
via autoxidation during storage remains unknown, which may have implications for indoor 75
environmental chemistry, consumer health, and occupational health. 76
Autoxidation is a spontaneous oxidative process of chemicals when exposed to air, it 77
is initiated by oxidative radicals and propagated via peroxide-involved radical chemistry.2778
Autoxidation is first known in the condensed phase, which is the cause of the deterioration 79
of many daily consumables, such as cooking oil,28,29and foods.30,31A decade ago, gas-phase 80
autoxidation of VOCs was discovered by Crounse et al.32Sooner this process has been iden- 81
tified as the critical process to produce highly oxygenated organic molecules, including the 82
production of carbonyls and organic acids from biogenic gaseous monoterpenes.33–35While 83
autoxidation was associated with numerous compounds, such chemical processes on glycols 84
did not gather enough attention in the past. Additionally, the oxidation of TEG is one of 85
the major concerns in the natural gas dehydration industry,36leading to significantly re- 86
duced productivity. The aliphatic nature of glycols, i.e., lack of unsaturated bonds, makes 87
them relatively less reactive to oxidative electrophiles (radicals, O3), which are usually the 88
initiators of autoxidation.37Our previous work, however, was the first to discover the forma- 89
tion of glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde from glycol-based fog machine juices during their 90
4storage and proposed evidence of autoxidation.38Glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde are two 91
toxic carbonyls found in the indoor air.39These aldehydes are often released indoors as the 92
product of organic combustion, bacterial activity, or atmospheric oxidation.40–4393
Our previous study also highlighted the need to find stronger evidence for the occurrence 94
of autoxidation, as well as the conditions under which autoxidation is favored. The presence 95
of peroxide is an indicator of autoxidation, whose concentration reflects the extent and the 96
rate of reaction. It can be quantified via certain mass spectrometric techniques,44–47but 97
the canonical method for total peroxide quantification has been iodometry.48–50Iodometry 98
is usually based on UV-Vis spectrometry because I-reacts selectively and quantitatively 99
with organic peroxides in the sample, and the resulting triiodide ion (I–
3) has a unique 100
absorption, peaking at 351 nm. This feature makes iodometry a sensitive and selective 101
method to quantify the total peroxide concentration.51102
The objective of this work is to systematically investigate the autoxidation of common 103
glycols during storage under room conditions and to discover its implications on indoor air 104
quality, product safety, and occupational health across various industries. Specifically, we 105
aim to quantify the formation of harmful end-products of autoxidation, such as formaldehyde 106
and glycolaldehyde. Moreover, iodometry will be conducted to monitor peroxide intermedi- 107
ates, and thus, the occurrence of autoxidation. Beyond these fundamental chemical analyses, 108
we would also investigate the effect of external factors, such as the water mixing ratio or 109
the presence of antioxidants, to provide suggestions to mitigate such risks of autoxidation in 110
glycol products. 111
Material and Methods 112
Chemicals and Materials 113
MilliQ water used in this study was generated by a Thermo-Fisher Scientific BarnsteadTM E- 114
PureTM Ultrapure Water Purification Systems. Reagent grade 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine 115
5(2,4-DNPH) (Purity 97%) was purchased from Alpha Aesar, and propylene glycol was pur- 116
chased from Fisher Scientific. Acetonitrile (HPLC-grade, Purity 99.9%), triethylene glycol 117
(TEG, Purity 99%), diethylene glycol (DEG, Purity 99%), glycerol (VG, Purity 99.5%) hy- 118
droquinone (Purity 99%), L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, Purity 99%), 37% formaldehyde in 119
water solution (with 10-15% methanol), glycolaldehyde dimer (Crystalline), propionaldehyde 120
(Purity 97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A commercially available E-cigarette juice 121
(EJ) is acquired from a local vape shop and contains 1:1 PG-VG and 10 mg/ml nicotine. 122
Potassium iodide (KI) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Hydrogen peroxide in water 123
(30% w/w), and glacier acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 124
Choice of Glycols 125
All the experimented glycols in the current study are listed in Table 1. Triethylene glycol 126
was selected to further investigate the fundamental of glycol autoxidation because it demon- 127
strated a significant formation of carbonyl from our previous study.38Additionally, PG and 128
VG were selected for their common use in inhalable products, including EJ. DEG, the small- 129
est poly-glycol commonly used as a food and drug additive, was selected to be compared 130
with TEG, given their chain length difference. Finally, an EJ was also tested in this study 131
to observe autoxidation in an actual product. We note that the EJ was chosen to have no 132
additives besides PG and VG (10 mg/ml nicotine, and flavorless) to minimize unknown side 133
reactions. 134
Sample preparation 135
The summary of sample preparation of the following three subsections is illustrated in Figure. 136
S1 in the Supplementary Information. All aging experiments listed below were conducted 137
over 7-8 weeks. All samples were stored under room conditions in a typical chemistry labora- 138
tory, with temperature controlled at around 22 ℃. Sampling activity was carried out at least 139
once weekly, with occasionally more frequent sampling. Before sampling, all samples were 140
6stirred on magnetic stir plates for at least five minutes to homogenize the glycol mixture. 141
Aging of Glycols 142
Two aging experiments were conducted to monitor the autoxidation of different glycols. The 143
first aging experiment (Exp. 1) was conducted with two groups of samples, referred to as 144
air-exposed samples or sealed samples. Each group of samples had five glass vials filled 145
with 20 ml of each glycol, as shown in Table 1 (TEG, PG, VG, DEG, and EJ) without 146
any dilution or modification. Air-exposed samples were stored without caps, which allowed 147
constant exposure to room air. Sealed samples were kept inside the vial with caps and 148
parafilm. The EJ sample in the sealed group was capped in its original package bottle and 149
sampled by directly squeezing it out. Additionally, sealed samples only had air exposure for 150
roughly 30 seconds during each sampling activity. 151
Effect of Water Mixing Ratios 152
Exp. 2 was designed to understand whether mixing with water would affect the rate of 153
glycol autoxidation. A set of TEG-water mixtures with increasing mixing ratios of water 154
(10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of water) was prepared. The pure TEG sample mentioned in the 155
previous section also served as 0% water when making the comparison. 156
As we discovered a variation across different water mixing ratios from Exp. 2, we repeated 157
the measurement of 50% TEG in a separate experiment (Exp.3 ) as a detailed investigation. 158
A triplicate set of air-exposed TEG samples, mixed with 50% (v/v) water was prepared in 159
the same glass vials. This water ratio was selective as we later discovered that the 50% water 160
mixing ratio has the most rapid formation of carbonyls. Also, this mixing ratio represents 161
commercial fog juice, as their water ratio may vary between 40% to 60%. For the negative 162
control group, we prepared the same 50% (v/v) sample and sealed it as described previously. 163
7Effect of Antioxidants 164
This experiment (Exp. 4) was designed based on the hypothesis that antioxidants can 165
suppress the autoxidation process in glycol mixtures. There are many types of antioxidants 166
studied previously,26,28,52Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) was selected as the antioxidant used 167
in our experiment, as it is an inexpensive and naturally existing antioxidant that can be 168
found in many consumables and in the human body.53Due to its ability to react with 169
a wide range of oxidants, it is considered the total reactive oxygen species scavenger.54,55170
Although the inhalation risk of Vitamin C aerosols remains unclear, some studies show that 171
the inhalation of Vitamin C is not harmful at proper dosages.56,57Vitamin C was added 172
directly into the air-exposed 50%-TEG water mixture, resulting in a concentration of 60 173
mM. This concentration is selected to ensure that antioxidant concentration is at least 10 174
times higher than that of peroxides determined in our sample, such that Vitamin C would 175
not be consumed entirely during the aging experiment. 176
Derivatization by 2,4-DNPH 177
The quantification of carbonyl compounds in this study primarily depended on a derivatiza- 178
tion reaction with 2,4-DNPH. 2,4-DNPH, or Brady’s reagent, is one of the most widely used 179
chemicals to measure small carbonyl compounds.58,59The specific methodology was adapted 180
from our previous study,38and thus is introduced only briefly here. A 2,4-DNPH working 181
stock solution was prepared before any of the analyses. It was a 1:1 (v/v) water-acetonitrile 182
solution containing 10 mM 2,4-DNPH and acidified by concentrated HCl, resulting in a pH 183
of 3.0. Glycols mentioned above were derivatized using the same method. Samples were 184
prepared in autosampler vials directly, each vial consisted of a diluted 2,4-DNPH working 185
solution (20% of the total volume, 2 mM final concentration) and the glycol (2% of the 186
total volume), a propionaldehyde internal standard (380 µM in the sample), and a spiked 187
carbonyl standard (20% of the total volume) for standard addition, as explained below. All 188
samples were derivatized in a 25 ℃-water bath for 2 hours. According to our previous work, 189
8the reaction will reach completion in 2 hours,38and neither a significant growth nor decay 190
of the hydrazone chromatogram peak was observed within 24 hours. 191
Standard Addition of Carbonyls 192
The method of standard addition was used to identify and quantify the formaldehyde and 193
glycolaldehyde in all samples, which can correct the fluctuation of derivatization efficiency 194
among samples. Carbonyl standards were prepared at five concentrations, such that their 195
final concentrations in autosampler vials ranged from 0 µM to 50 µM. Standard solutions only 196
contain formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, it was prepared by dissolving formaldehyde (37% 197
water solution) and glycolaldehyde (crystalline dimer) into a 50% ACN solution. This stock 198
solution was then diluted to the correct concentrations. Standard solutions were refreshed 199
monthly to avoid the decomposition of carbonyls. 200
Mass Spectrometric Analysis 201
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used in this study. Separation was 202
done by an Agilent 1100 series LC, detection was done by a Thermo Fisher Scientific Lin- 203
ear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer system (Thermo Fisher LTQ-XL). The LC separation was 204
conducted with a Phenomenex Luna Omega 150 ×2.1 mm 3 µm Polar C18 column. All 205
measurements were done by electrospray ionization in negative mode (ESI (-)). Detailed set- 206
tings for the mass spectrometer and the HPLC can be found in Section S2 in Supplementary 207
Information. 208
Iodometry UV-Vis Measurement 209
The solution and sample preparation procedure of iodometry can be found in Section S3, the 210
method is adopted and modified based on the work of Mutzel et al.44UV-Vis instrument 211
used in this experiment is Agilent 8453 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. Absorbance at 351 nm 212
was selected to quantify the peroxide concentration in samples. 213
9Safety 214
This project is associated with the use of 2,4-DNPH, concentrated acid, carcinogenic alde- 215
hydes, and a mass spectrometer. 2,4-DNPH is shock-sensitive and explosive when dried, 216
hence it must be stored under damp conditions and away from oxidizer. Concentrated acid 217
is required to make up the 2,4-DNPH derivatization solution, thus must be handled inside 218
the fume hood, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Alde- 219
hydes involved, such as formaldehyde, are very volatile, therefore handling inside the fume 220
hood with appropriate PPE required. The mass spectrometer is utilizing high voltage and 221
high temperature at the injection housing. Therefore it is crucial to avoid touching the area 222
during instrumental operations. 223
Results and Discussion 224
Carbonyl Production from Aging 225
Various carbonyls were recognized in all glycol samples. Different chromatograms of TEG 226
and EJ were observed in Figures 1A and 1B after exposure to the air over weeks. Identities of 227
detected peaks were confirmed via molecular mass, or spiking with pure carbonyl standards. 228
Aldehydes and ketones with the same molecular mass were identified via MS2scan since their 229
hydrazones have unique fragmentation profiles. The peak with m/z 163 is the indicator 230
of aldehydes due to the loss of -RNO2, while this fragment is absent in ketone-derived 231
hydrazones.60232
Aged glycols contain carbonyls of various sizes. Small carbonyls, like formaldehyde or 233
glycolaldehyde, were likely produced due to the decomposition of long-chain glycols; Large 234
carbonyls, such as TEG-aldehyde ([2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy) ethoxy] acetaldehyde), PG-ketone 235
(Lactaldehyde), or VG-ketone (Hydroxyacetone), were formed due to functionalizations 236
which convert hydroxyl groups to the carbonyl groups. These functionalized carbonyls are 237
10glycol-specific, as their structures are dependent on the parent glycol. In the TEG sample 238
shown in Figure 1A, we identified the dominant carbonyl as TEG-aldehyde, which comes 239
from the oxidation of one hydroxyl terminal on the glycol. Formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde 240
were identified as the decomposition product of TEG, whose peaks were intensified after 7-8 241
weeks of storage. This indicates a rapid fragmentation of TEG has happened during its ag- 242
ing. The aged TEG also produced a peak of DEG-aldehyde, suggesting that DEG-aldehyde 243
is one of the fragmentation products of the TEG molecule, this implies the gradual chain 244
reduction of long glycols produces smaller derivatives. 245
EJ sample is based on a mixture of PG and VG, it contains PG and VG-derived car- 246
bonyls after aging, such as VG-aldehyde, PG-aldehyde, and ketones, as shown in Figure 1B. 247
The aging of EJ has also intensified peaks of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, similar to 248
the TEG sample. This suggests that these two carbonyls are the common products of glycol 249
decomposition despite the structural differences. It is intriguing to note that the majority 250
of identified carbonyl species were already present in samples before we started the experi- 251
ment. Hence the accumulation of carbonyls was initiated while the product is still with the 252
manufacturer or the vendor. 253
Carbonyl Accumulation in Pure Glycols 254
We selectively quantified formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde in all glycol samples involved 255
in Experiment 1 (Figure 2), due to the limited commercial availability of pure carbonyl 256
standards. Results in Figure 2 confirm that air-exposed glycols have a higher aldehyde 257
concentration than sealed samples after 6 to 8 weeks of aging. When compared to the sealed 258
sample, an air-exposed glycol usually has a higher final concentration of carbonyls while 259
initial concentrations were similar. Hence, air exposure is a key factor of carbonyl formation 260
during storage, which is also in agreement with the conditions required for autoxidation. 261
TEG samples under both aging conditions have by far the highest initial concentration 262
of aldehydes, followed by EJ samples, while PG and DEG samples have the lowest. The 263
11initial concentration of aldehydes is likely produced during manufacturing and transporta- 264
tion. Details of the initial and final carbonyl concentrations are listed in the Supplementary 265
Information (Section S4). Among air-exposed samples, PG has the most rapid relative in- 266
crease of formaldehyde, followed by TEG, EJ, VG, and DEG. However, TEG had the most 267
rapid formation of absolute formaldehyde, as well as glycolaldehyde. Among sealed samples, 268
the formation of carbonyls is not as rapid as air-exposed samples, but TEG and EJ still 269
have a relatively more rapid formation than others. We noted that sealed samples are more 270
representative of real-life storage of glycol-containing products, as the majority of the time 271
closed. 272
An out-of-scale aldehyde concentration observed in TEG in Figure 2 indicates that TEG 273
could undergo autoxidation more rapidly than others. It is likely due to chain lengths and 274
the ether-link structure. The initiation of autoxidation is often carried out via electrophilic 275
H-abstraction, which prefers carbon atoms adjacent to an electron-donating group.61While 276
hydroxyl groups are electron-donating, electron density on the ether group is higher (Kwok 277
1995). Hence, TEG is susceptible to H-abstraction by having two ether groups within the 278
molecule. Additionally, a longer and less-hindered chain of TEG makes more active sites for 279
H-abstraction. This allows more frequent 1,5-H shift, which is a key process of the peroxide 280
formation and autoxidation propagation.32,62,63Moreover, functionalized products such as 281
TEG-aldehyde or DEG-aldehyde still retain multiple active sites for electrophilic addition. 282
Hence subsequent autoxidation is likely to happen on those products, leading to a high yield 283
of small carbonyls per glycol molecule. On the other hand, the chain length for PG, VG, 284
and DEG are short, therefore fewer active carbons. Additional branching may also hinder 285
efficient 1,5-H shifts. 286
Aging of TEG in Water Mixtures 287
Given that carbonyl formation was observed to be the most rapid in TEG, TEG was further 288
used here for an in-depth investigation. To test out the effect of the water mixing ratio 289
12on formation rates of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde from TEG, we have monitored the 290
concentration of the carbonyls in a gradient of water mixing ratio ranging from 0% to 70% 291
water. 292
Quality Control 293
Two aspects in our experimental design may cause bias to our results and hence were inves- 294
tigated first. The first aspect is the evaporation of the solution, which concentrates analytes 295
over time. This is due to uncovered air samples experiencing unavoidable solution evapo- 296
ration constantly. According to the database,64all glycols in this work have far less vapor 297
pressure (at least three orders of magnitude) than water. Therefore, we assume that loss of 298
water contributed to all observed evaporations. This aspect was addressed by monitoring 299
the mass loss of the solution in glycol-water mixtures over weeks. A first-order fitting of the 300
remaining mass was performed for each of the four glycol-water mixing ratios. Based on this 301
time-dependent trace of evaporation, a correction was applied to all of our observations. 302
Another aspect is the uneven recovery ratios of carbonyls from different glycol-water mix- 303
ing ratios, especially when the ratio is affected by water evaporation. Although the method 304
of standard addition was applied, which ideally eliminates all matrix effects, smaller recovery 305
rates in pure glycol samples were observed. This is confirmed via four sets of repeated spike- 306
recovery experiments. On average, we observed a 70.6% ( ±4.7%) recovery in pure glycol 307
samples and 90.9% ( ±4.4%) in 50% glycol samples. Thus, we assumed a linear relationship 308
between the recovery rates and glycol mixing ratios and applied the corresponding correction 309
to all of our data. Details of bias correction to our data can be found in Section S5 in the 310
Supplementary Information. 311
The mean error of standard addition in these replicates was determined. A total number 312
of 16 standard addition (done on different days) was performed in this recovery experiment. 313
The mean error of standard addition was calculated to be 7.45%, which will be treated as 314
the standard error of all later carbonyl quantitation. 315
13Effect of Water Mixing Ratios 316
The formation rate of carbonyls varies between different water mixing ratios for both formalde- 317
hyde (Figure 3A) and glycolaldehyde (Figure 3B). All data shown were corrected by the sol- 318
vent evaporation and recovery artifacts, explained in the previous section. Both aldehydes 319
exhibit a similar trend: the 50% mixing ratio was the fastest, followed by the 30% mixing 320
ratio, and 0%, 10%, and 70% ratios have slower rates. We also noticed that the 50% mixing 321
ratio has a two-stage time profile and that the formation rate was accelerated around day 322
20 in both aldehydes. This two-stage profile may have implications for the formation of 323
peroxides in the mixture, which is a determining factor of carbonyl formation rates. This 324
will be discussed in the latter section. 325
Rather, the 70% water sample displayed behavior that was inconsistent with other ratios. 326
In terms of formaldehyde, its formation rate was comparable to pure and 10% water samples, 327
while it started accelerating after day 30. Eventually, the final concentration of formaldehyde 328
in the 70% mixing ratio was about 500% of the initial value, which is lower than the 30% 329
and 50% mixing ratios (about 650% and 800%, respectively). In terms of glycolaldehyde, the 330
time profile is almost overlapping with the pure sample. Overall, our results show that water 331
likely plays a non-linear role in the autoxidation of TEG and the formation of carbonyls. Up 332
to 50% water, the formation rate of carbonyls increased with the water mixing ratio; however, 333
this trend is no longer observed at water ratios above that. The inconsistent behavior of a 334
70% mixing ratio requires further investigation. 335
Aging of 50% TEG 336
As we discussed in the previous section, 50% TEG has the most rapid carbonyl formation. 337
Additionally, our previous work has observed that formaldehyde accumulation in the artificial 338
fog juice (typically around 50% water) was more pronounced than in pure glycol done in 339
this project.38As a result, we have conducted a separate experiment to further investigate 340
the aging of 50% TEG in both air-exposed and sealed conditions. 341
14According to Figure 4, air-exposed 50% TEG has a more rapid formation of both com- 342
pounds than the air-exposed pure TEG, confirming that water is promoting the formation 343
of carbonyls. As also mentioned previously, formaldehyde formation in the air-exposed 50% 344
TEG sample appears to have two distinct stages before and after approximately day 22, 345
where the formation rate of formaldehyde has drastically increased, indicating accelerated 346
autoxidation. The final concentration of formaldehyde in air-exposed 50% TEG was about 347
400% of that in the pure sample, whereas for glycolaldehyde it was about 300%. The two- 348
stage profile of formaldehyde has coincided with the evaporation of water. As we tracked 349
the first-order rate of water evaporation from 50% TEG, we calculated that water would be 350
mostly evaporated by day 22. Therefore, the presence or absence of water could potentially 351
alter the formation of autoxidation products. 352
Iodometry and Peroxide Accumulation 353
Observations from the previous sections highlighted that the formation of aldehydes was not 354
monotonic throughout the aging period. The rate of autoxidation was likely varying over 355
time, and as such, it is crucial to monitor the peroxide concentration in glycol samples so 356
that we can estimate the extent of autoxidation during air exposure. 357
The concentration of peroxides in air-exposed 50% TEG and other glycols were quantified 358
at two stages of the experiment, as in Figure 5A. Overall, we observed all samples had higher 359
peroxide concentrations at the end of the experiment. 50% TEG has the most rapid peroxide 360
formation, which raised from about 1.4 mM to 7 mM. PG and VG have about 10 µM and 35 361
µM at the end, while their initial concentration was below LOD (3 µM). DEG has an initial 362
concentration of 14 µM, which increased to 29 µM eventually. The formation of peroxides 363
mirrored that of carbonyls, and this was particularly pronounced for 50% TEG. 364
Figure 5B presents the average concentration of peroxides in a set of triplicate air-exposed 365
50% TEG samples throughout the experiment. Error bars on the peroxide concentration 366
reflect the standard deviation of peroxide concentration in these samples. The two shaded 367
15areas are the average formation rates of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde in these samples 368
with a three-point smoothing applied. The formation rate is calculated based on the slope 369
of two consecutive points of their concentration profiles, i.e., the differential. 370
The peroxide concentration varied significantly as the exposure time got longer. Initially, 371
it was less than 2000 µM in all triplicate samples, while a week later it started rising rapidly. 372
Between day 22 and day 30, peroxide concentration reached a peak beyond 7000 µM. Finally, 373
it starts gradually descending from the peak and is still above 6000 µM before we stopped 374
measuring. The time profile of the carbonyl formation rate has shown a strong correlation 375
with the peroxide concentration with the two reaching their peaks around the same time. 376
This peak time also coincides with the time that water has completely evaporated. After 377
the peak period, the carbonyl formation rate stabilized at around 300 µM per day. 378
The agreement between the peroxide and the carbonyl formation is a critical observation, 379
indicating that the rapid carbonyl formation is the result of a high peroxide concentration. 380
The involvement of water in autoxidation has never been investigated previously. The role 381
of water could be very complicated and cannot be explicitly explained by our work; however, 382
there are a few potential explanations. Water could increase the OH radical reactivity by 383
changing the solution viscosity. Lower viscosity allows the diffusion of atmospheric OH 384
radical towards the glycol, or diffusion of glycol molecules to the surface of the solution so 385
direct contact with atmospheric oxidants is made.65OH radicals can also form a relatively 386
stable solvation complex with a neighboring water molecule, thus the radical becomes more 387
stable in the aqueous environment.66According to the literature value,67the viscosity of 388
pure TEG is about 36 times higher than that of pure water. 389
Moreover, the presence of water can promote local OH formation in the solution. Indoor 390
concentration of OH radicals are a few orders of magnitude lower than outdoors (about 391
10-6 ppb) due to the low availability of ultraviolet radiation,68,69and their transportation 392
from outdoors is less significant due to their reactive nature.70However, the transportation of 393
ozone is more significant, whose indoor concentration is about 5-6 orders of magnitude higher 394
16than the OH radical.71,72Ozone, once dissolved in water, can spontaneously react with water 395
to produce OH radicals.73,74This reaction is favored in neutral or basic conditions since it 396
is initiated by ozone and hydroxide ions, while the pH of fresh TEG is approximately 7.36397
Effect of Antioxidants 398
Compared to samples without antioxidants, Vitamin C has successfully suppressed the for- 399
mation of both formaldehyde (Figure 6A) and glycolaldehyde (Figure 6B) in our sample 400
throughout the entire period. For glycolaldehyde, the concentrations in the air-exposed 401
sample were even smaller than those in the sealed sample, indicating that the anti-oxidizing 402
capacity of Vitamin C overcame the enhanced oxidant exposure in the air-exposed sample. 403
The suppression of formaldehyde formation by Vitamin C is likely due to its ability to scav- 404
enge a wide variety of reactive oxygen species,75including organic peroxides.76We could not 405
apply iodometry after vitamin C application, as it can react with I2spontaneously and no 406
I–
3will be formed.77407
Conclusions 408
This study represents hitherto the most detailed investigation of autoxidation of common 409
glycol species used in daily inhalable products, intending to understand toxic compound 410
formation during storage. All of the investigated glycols exhibited the formation of harmful 411
carbonyl compounds, including formaldehyde, and glycolaldehyde, among many others, when 412
exposed to room air over weeks. The detection of such carbonyls also suggests the potential 413
cause of various glycol-related health issues, such as EVALI, or voice loss experienced by stage 414
actors. Our observations provide strong and novel evidence that autoxidation is responsible 415
for their formation because 1) faster formation rates were observed for air-exposed samples, 2) 416
TEG (with the longest chain) exhibited the most significant carbonyl formation, 3) peroxide 417
formation corresponded with the carbonyl formation, and 4) the addition of an antioxidant 418
17(L-ascorbic acid) suppressed carbonyl formation. 419
The formation of carbonyls in inhalable products can be a significant health concern. 420
Formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde are known carcinogens, while peroxides belong to reactive 421
oxygen species and introduce oxidative stress to the human body. Inhaling contaminated 422
products, such as e-cigarettes or artificial fog, can represent an unrecognized exposure path- 423
way to these harmful compounds. The actual exposure risk depends on the type of products 424
used, their shelf age, as well as the indoor environment. For instance, smoking an e-cigarette 425
could lead to high glycolaldehyde exposure despite only glycols and nicotine being involved; 426
our previous study also showed that the frequent use of a fog machine in a poorly ventilated 427
venue might lead to a formaldehyde concentration greater than 150 ppb in the air.38It is 428
expected that e-cigarette smokers and people who frequently use such products in an indoor 429
setting, e.g., actors and workers in the entertainment industries, are at a greater risk. 430
A discovery made by this work is the relationship between the carbonyl formation rate 431
and the TEG-water mixing ratio. We have shown that water likely promoted the autox- 432
idation of TEG. The explicit reason was complicated and could not be identified by this 433
work, but possible explanations were explored. The mixture of glycols and water is vari- 434
able across consumable products. For example, personal care products and cosmetics are 435
water-dominant; paints and fog juices usually contain around 50% of water; e-cigarettes and 436
surface coatings typically contain minimal water. Additionally, the pure form of glycols is 437
not completely immune from oxidative degradation either, as shown by a slower but con- 438
sistent carbonyl formation observed in this work, as well as the fact that many purchased 439
glycols contained certain concentrations of carbonyl and peroxides. 440
Overall, our study raises potential concerns regarding product safety for glycol-based con- 441
sumables. Proper storage protocols and expiration dates should be mandated and regulated. 442
Based on this work, a few suggestions can be made to mitigate the risk of glycol autoxi- 443
dation. First, minimizing air exposure is important to prevent rapid autoxidation. Second, 444
avoiding glycol-water mixture during storage can slow down the autoxidation process. For 445
18instance, artificial fog juices can be sold as TEG or a mixture of glycols without water, and 446
consumers should mix it with water before use. While this work was limited to TEG-water 447
mixtures, future studies should be extended to the water mixtures of other glycol species. 448
Third, as shown in this work, the addition of antioxidants can suppress autoxidation and the 449
formation of harmful chemicals. However, the inhalation risks of antioxidants themselves 450
should be carefully evaluated before application. 451
