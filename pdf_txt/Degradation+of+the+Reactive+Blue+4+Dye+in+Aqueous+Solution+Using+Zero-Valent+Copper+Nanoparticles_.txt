Introduction
A number of dyes are employed in the synthesis of 
various products of commercial value [1]. Even little 
amounts of dye produce significant color [2], which is 
undesirable and is problematic in the environment where it is being disposed of [3, 4]. These dyes are an alarming 
threat to aquatic biota [5]. Therefore, dye removal from 
effluents is needed to safeguard human health and for the 
preservation and betterment of the natural environment 
[6-9]. Many physical, chemical and biological methods 
are in use, but these methods have  certain drawbacks. 
Physical methods convert pollution from liquid form 
to solid form as sludge [10]. Treatment of industrial 
wastewater by chemical methods often generates  more 
toxic metabolites/products than their precursors [11].Pol. J. Environ. Stud. Vol. 29, No. 1 (2020), 609-616

Abstract
Our current study deals with the green synthesis of copper nanoparticles using extract of Labeo 
rohita fish scales. There is no need to add any  external  reducing  and stabilizing agents  as the gelatin 
found in fish scale  extract  possesses plenty of reducing and stabilizing properties. The synthesized 
copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) were characterized by Zeita sizer and SEM. Cu-NPs were applied to 
decolorize Reactive Blue 19 dye. Different experimental conditions like concentration of reactive Blue 
19 dye, concentration of copper nanoparticles, pH and temperature were optimized. The degrading 
potential of copper nanoparticles increased their applicability for the decolorization of Reactive Blue 
19 dye. Reactive Blue 19 dye was maximum decolorized (90.18%) at aconc. of 0.03%, 4 mg Cu-NPs, 
pH 10 at 50ºC. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated by water quality assurance parameters 
such as total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).  The reaction products were 
characterized by FTIR spectral studies.

These methods are therefore potentially less efficient for 
the removal of problematic dyes [12]. Nanotechnology is 
an emerging technology that plays a significant role in 
environmental remediation [13]. The use of nanoparticles 
is gaining more popularity for effective removal of 
contaminants from wastewater [14]. It is an efficient way 
to remove a wide variety of toxicants from industrial 
wastewaters [15]. Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles 
using waste material offers a promising approach for 
environmental remediation [16]. The fish-processing 
industry produces 30-40% of solid waste [17]. Different 
methods such as landfilling and incineration are used 
to get rid of fishery waste [18], which contains a high 
amount of proteins, oil and chitin [19]. Preparation of 
nanoparticles via fish scales is a greener approach, being 
cost-effective and environmentally friendly in nature 
[20]. Gold-, silver- and platinum-based nanoparticles 
are found to be effective in removal of contaminants. 
These metallic nanoparticles are replaced by copper 
nanoparticles because of easy availability and cost-
effective nature [21]. The use of copper nanoparticles 
for organic pollutant degradation was found to be an 
effective method [22]. Studies demonstrate that metallic 
nanoparticles are capable of promoting the degradation 
of dyes, which occurs by reductive [23] or oxidative 
processes [24]. During reductive processes, the oxidized 
metal supplies electrons to the dye molecule [25].  Copper 
nanoparticles can favor the in situ hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) formation in an acidified system by oxi-reduction 
reactions. In these systems,  radicals are formed, which 
act on the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants 
like a Fenton-like reaction [26]. The present project was 
planned to synthesize copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) 
using scales of Labeo rohita . Copper nanoparticles were 
applied to decolorize the problematic Reactive Blue 19 
dye, used on the textile sector for dyeing process. The 
degradation products were identified by FTIR spectral 
analysis.
Materials and Methods
Material
All chemicals were of analytical grade purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Fish scales 
were taken from a fish market of Faisalabad, Pakistan, 
cleaned using purified water, ground and dried in an 
oven at 60ºC. The dried material was sieved and stored.  
Preparation of Aqueous Extract 
of Fish Scales
The fine powder of L. rohita  scales (10 g) were put in 
flask of 500 mL distilled water and placed on hot plate 
for 20 minutes at 70ºC. Hot material was centrifuged 
at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. The extract was taken and 
stored at 4ºC in a refrigerator [27].Synthesis of Cu Nanoparticles (Cu-NPs)
10 mL aqueous solution of copper chloride (0.1 M) 
was added to 10 mL fish scale extract (10%) and heated 
for 15 min. at 70ºC followed by slow cooling to room 
temperature. The solution was allowed to stabilize for  
3 days. Light-brown particles were formed at the bottom 
of the vessel [8]. The synthesized particles were vacuum 
filtered, washed with water and ethanol, and finally 
dried. The particles were stored at -4ºC [28].
Characterization of Cu-Nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) 
via SEM
The most important parameter for characterization 
of nanoparticles is their particle size. The sample was 
taken in glass cuvette and the temperature was 25ºC 
and the system was run for 21 seconds. The synthesized 
nanoparticles were subjected to the spectrophotometer 
(perfect system spectrophotometer MS-4375) for  
the UV–Vis absorption spectra, λmax in nm, furnished 
with quartz cell. The SEM images were documented 
with the help of a scanning electron microscope (FEI 
Quanta 400 FEG). The samples were first gold-coated 
by using a sputter coater, and then obtained the SEM 
micrograph. 
Determining Size Distribution Intensity 
by Dynamic Light Scattering Method
Dynamic light scattering capacities (DLS) were 
determined out on Malvern Zeta sizer (Nano ZS 
ZEN 3600). The particle size is one of the most 
important parameters for characterizing nanoparticles.  
The sample was taken in a glass cuvette and the 
temperature was set to 25oC, and the system was run for 
21 seconds. 
Application of Synthesized Cu-NPs for 
Decolorization of Reactive Blue 19 Dye
Preparation of Dye Solution
Different concentrations (0.01%, 0.03%, 0.05%, 
0.07%, 0.1%) of Reactive Blue 19 dye were prepared and 
were diluted ten times to scan λmax.

Experimental Procedure
5 mL of dye (Reactive Blue 19) solution (0.01%) was 
diluted up to 50 mL. pH of solution was maintained to 
6 and 1 mg of Cu-NPs were added to it. The reaction 
was let to run at 30ºC for a period of 75 min. Same 
experiments were done with other concentrations (0.03, 
0.05, 0.07 and 0.1%) of Reactive Blue 19 dye solution.
In order to optimize Cu-NP concentration, different 
concentrations of Cu-NPs (1-5 mg/50 mL of dye solution) 
were taken. Different pH (4-12) values were optimized 
using the same methodology. Different temperatures 
(30-70ºC) were also optimized. The experiments were 
run following the same methodology described above. 
One parameter was varied at a time while keeping 
others constant [29].
Chemical Analysis
The progress of the reaction was checked by 
measuring absorbance at 425 nm using a UV-visible 
spectrophotometer (perfect system spectrophotometer 
MS-4375) after every 15 minutes. Decolorization (%) 
was calculated by the formula given below:
Decolorization (%) = (I-F)/I × 100
…where I is the initial absorbance and F is the final 
absorbance of decolorized or treated dye solution.
Mineralization Study
Different quality assurance parameters like total 
organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) were determined to study the mineralization 
efficiency following the standard protocols [30].
Spectral Analysis
The degradation products were characterized by 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The 
results were computed by measuring standard error of 
means [31].
Results and Discussion
SEM Analysis
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures, the 
scatterings were weakened with water and drop-cast onto  
a silicon wafer. The samples were dried under 
encompassing conditions. SEM was performed with 
an FEI Quanta 400 FEG outfitted with an auxiliary 
electron (SE) identifier. The size and morphology  of the synthesized Cu-NPs were analyzed by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images  
(Fig. 1a-c) revealed the synthesis of copper nanoparticles 
(Cu-NPs) using Labeo rohita fish scale extract as 
stabilizing and reducing medium. Particles appeared as 
spherical and crystalline, and some particles were in the 
form of clusters. These images were taken from 5, 10 
and 20 μm. At 5 μm, the image was cleared and showed 
the formation of spherical NPs [32].
Determining Size Distribution Intensity 
by Dynamic Light Scattering Method
Refractive index of the material was found to be 
2.63. Material absorption was 0.001. The average particle  
size of  synthesized copper nanoparticles  was found to Fig. 1. a) SEM image of NPs from distance of 20 μm, b) SEM 
image of NPs from distance of 10 μm, c) SEM image of NPs 
from distance of 5 μm.

be 1352 nm. Particle size analysis showed the presence 
of nanoparticles with polydispersity index (PDI)  
value 0.323 and with intercept 0.966 (Fig. 2). The 
DLS method was found to be effective for studying  
the light scattering patters of different particles effectively 
[27].
Determination of λmax
To determine the wavelength of maximum 
absorbance, the absorbance over the range of  
400-650 nm was measured, usually in interval of 25 nm. 
The  λmax was found to be 425 nm as shown in Fig. 3.
Optimizing Conditions for the Decolorization 
of Reactive Blue 19 dye
Decolorization (%) of Reactive Blue 19 dye was 
studied by optimizing the different experimental 
parameters, such as effect of concentration of dye, 
concentration of copper nanoparticles, pH and temperature to get optimized conditions for maximum 
decolorization of the dye under study.
Effect of Dye Concentration
Reaction was carried out with different 
concentrations (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1%) of 
Reactive Blue 19 dye solutions for 75 minutes. As the 
concentration of dye solution was increased from 0.01 
to 0.03%, the decolorization (%) was increased from 
67.47% to 80.44%. Further increase in concentration 
up to 0.1% resulted in a decrease in decolorization 
(Fig. 4). When initial concentration of a dye increased, 
there are more dye molecules to be broken up by the 
catalyst up to a saturation point. Further increases in 
concentration of dye molecules and degradation of 
dye may be retarded due to the hindrance caused by 
the metabolites formed during the reaction [33] or  
non-availability of a more catalytic surface to catalyze 
the reaction [34, 35].

Effect of Concentration of Copper Nanoparticles 
(Cu-NPs)
It is known from previous studies that more number 
of nanoparticles result in the enhanced rate of dye 
removal, owing to the availability of more catalytic 
surfaces to be attacked on the chromophoric group 
of the target dye [30]. It could be seen from Fig. 5 
that as the concentration of copper nanoparticles was 
increased from 1-4 mg, the decolorization of dye was 
increased from 65.43 to 83.65%. A further increase in 
concentration of nanoparticles resulted in a decline 
in decolorization (%), which might be due to the 
agglomeration or sedimentation of nanoparticles [11]. 
The greater the concentration of nanoparticles, the 
more the number of active sites of catalyst are to be 
attacked on the chromophoric group of the target dye. 
After a certain concentration, the decolorization of 
dye decreased due to saturation of catalytic surface 
or the formation of by products, which may act as 
inhibitors resulting in a decrease in decolorization 
efficiency of the catalyst. Increases in the photo-catalyst 
loading do not lead to significant higher decolorization 
efficiency. This may be due to the fact that at high 
catalyst concentrations, the catalyst particles inclined 
to accumulate, which decrease the catalytic action by 
reducing its specific surface area [36, 37]. 
Effect of pH
pH is a very important parameter. A minor change 
in pH may result in a major change in reaction rate. Hence its optimization is deemed necessary. 
pH varied between 4-12 and results are shown in  
Fig. 6. It was seen that decolorization (%) increased 
with increases in pH up to 10. A further increase in pH 
resulted in a decrease in decolorization (%). Maximum 
decolorization was found to be 88.19% at pH 10  
(Fig. 6), which may be due to increased production rate 
of hydroxyl ions in basic medium. At low pH, H+ are 
greater than interacting with dye molecules and reduce 
the interaction of hydroxyl radical with dye [38]. pH of 
the solution is a complex factor since it is linked with 
the ionization state of the nanoparticle surface and that 
of the reactants and products [39]. At higher pH, there is 
an enhanced repulsion between dye negative charges and 
nanoparticle anionic surface, which hinders molecules 
migration from the solution to the nanoparticle surface 
[40].
Effect of Temperature 
Temperature is a crucial factor for the decolorization 
of dyes. Decolorization (%) was studied at different 
temperatures ranging from 30-70ºC. Increases in 
temperature resulted in increases in decolorization (%) 
of up to 50ºC. Maximum decolorization (90.18%) was 
obtained at 50ºC (Fig. 7). The increase in decolorization 
(%) with increase in temperature may be due to 
increases in binding sites of the catalyst. As binding 
sites increased, decolorization (%) also increased. 
Moreover, as the temperature increases, oxidation rate 
of dye also increases, but after a particular temperature 
the catalytic efficiency is retarded [41].
Effect of Reaction Time
Reaction was carried out for 75 minutes. Maximum 
decolorization (%) was achieved at 60 minutes (Fig. 8). 
Thus, it can be concluded that with the passage of time, 
decolorization (%) increases up to 60 minutes and after 
60 minutes it decreases [9].
FTIR Analysis
An FTIR study was carried out to describe the 
products generated as a result of degradation of 
Reactive Blue 19 dye. Comparison among FTIR spectra Fig. 5. Effect of concentration of copper nanoparticles on 
decolorization (%) of Reactive Blue 19 dye.

of untreated dye solution with treated indicated the 
degradation of dye when it was subjected to catalytic 
treatment. FTIR spectrum of untreated Reactive Blue 
19 dye exhibited peaks at 3344.59, 2352.21, 1646.3, 
619.15 and 613.956 cm-1 for –OH stretch of phenol, N=N 
stretch and C=C stretching of monosubstituted benzene 
ring (Fig. 9a), whereas treated dye solution displayed  
peaks at 3295.81 cm-1 for –OH stretch due to the 
presence of –COOH group, 2941.08 cm-1 and 
2825.79 cm-1 for C-H stretching of alkyl benzene, 2351.33 cm-1 for =C-H stretch, 1739.42 cm-1 for 
-C-H deformation, 1460.07 cm-1 for -C-H bending, 
1251.66 and 1025.52 cm-1 for C-O stretch in –COOH 
group, 604.28 and 657.49 cm-1 for monosubstituted 
benzene ring (Fig. 9b). There were no peaks in the 
region of 3400 to 3380 cm-1 specified by the absence 
of a mines when our dye was exposed to catalytic 
treatment using Cu-NPs. FTIR spectral analysis 
indicated that decolorization of dye under study was 
due to degradation of dye into intermediate products. 
Distinctive peak of azo linkage at 1646.3 cm-1 was not 
there, signifying breakage of Reactive Blue 19 dye. 
Aromatic a mines were formed during the reaction as 
intermediate ones, which were exposed to oxidation, 
giving the simplest mixes. Our results are in accordance 
with the literature [42].
Mineralization Study
Analysis of quality assurance parameters like 
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic 
carbon (TOC) of treated samples were carried out 
to find out their mineralization efficiency. Reduction 
(%) in COD and TOC was observed with the increase Fig. 8. Effect of reaction time on the decolorization (%) of 
Reactive Blue 19 dye using copper nanoparticles.

in reaction contact time from 10 to 50 minutes. The 
maximum reduction (%) in COD and TOC obtained at 
50 min. were 88.23% and 86.77%, respectively (Fig. 10). 
Reduction (%) of COD and TOC with the progressive 
rise in time depicted the mineralization of dye under 
study [9]. It can be inferred that copper nanoparticles 
not only decolorize the Reactive Blue 19 dye but also 
reduce the COD and TOC, indicating degradation of the 
dye [42].
Conclusions
The developed method was found to be green, 
environmental friendly and economical. The current 
study was done to investigate the decolorization 
of Reactive Blue 19 using copper-NPs synthesized 
by green route. Maximum decolorization (%) was 
found to be 92.52% under optimized experimental 
conditions. The findings of the current study showed 
that these synthesized copper NPs could be applied 
for decolorization of Reactive Blue 19. Thus, notorious 
dyes and industrial effluents containing these dyes can 
be detoxified using copper NPs. The study found that 
without using any chemical reagent as stabilizing and 
reducing agents, the copper nanoparticles are stable. 
Hence this cost-effective and eco-friendly method is 
highly promising for future.
