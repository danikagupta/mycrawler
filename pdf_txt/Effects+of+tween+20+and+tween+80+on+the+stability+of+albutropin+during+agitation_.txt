  Abstract  1 
Amyloid protein aggregates are not only associated with neurodegenerative diseases and may also 2 
occur as unwanted by -product s in protein -based therapeutics. Surfactants are often employed to 3 
stabilize protein formulations and reduce the risk of aggregation. However, surfactants alter protein - 4 
protein interactions and may thus modulate the physico chemical characteristics of any aggregates 5 
formed.  Human insulin aggregation was induced  at low pH  in the presence of varying concentrations 6 
of the surfactant polysorbate 80. Various spectroscopic and imaging  methods were used to study the 7 
aggregation kinetics, as well as structure  and morphology of the formed aggregates . Molecular 8 
dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the initial interaction between the surfactant and 9 
insulin.  Addition of polysorbate 80 slowed down, but did not prevent, agg regation of insulin. Amyloid 10 
spherulites formed under all conditions, with a higher content of intermolecular beta -sheets in the 11 
presence of the surfactant above its critical micelle concentration. In addition, a denser packing was 12 
observed, leading to a m ore stable aggregate. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested a tendency 13 
for insulin to  form dimers in the presence of the surfactant, indicating a change in protein -protein 14 
interactions. It is thus shown that surfactants not only alter aggregation kineti cs, but also affect 15 
physicochemical properties of any aggregates formed . 16

Introduction  1 
Both in vitro  and in vivo  and in destabilizing conditions , proteins  may undergo self -assembly 2 
processes leading to the format ion of a variety of aggregates . A specific class of these aggregates, 3 
named amyloids, are implicated in the onset of human pathologies such as Alzheimer's and 4 
Parkinson´s disease s (Taylor et al. 2002, Knowles et al. 2014)  and type 2 diabetes (Kahn et al. 1999, 5 
Höppener and Lips 2006) . Also,  the impact of protein a ggregates in the development of protein   6 
therapeutics may be significant , resulting in loss of active material  (Wang et al. 2010, van de Weert 7 
and Randolph 2013) , clogging of needles and infusion lines  (van de Weert and Randolph 2013) , and 8 
be a potential risk factor for unwanted immunogenicity  in patients  (Jiskoot et al. 2012) . However, 9 
due to the ir exceptional  strength and  elasticity , self-assembled protein structures are also investigated 10 
for potential applications as biomaterials  (Otzen  and Nielsen 2008, Knowles and Buehler 2011, 11 
Knowles and Mezzenga 2016) , for biosensing (Hauser et al. 2014) , drug delivery  (Maji et al. 2008) , 12 
and water purification  (Bolisetty and Mezze nga 2016) . 13 
Among the different protein aggregates, elongated β -sheet -rich structures  named  amyloid fibrils 14 
are the most studied  (Dobson 1999, Dobson 2004, Gallardo et al. 2020) . Moreover,  both in vitro  and 15 
in vivo  proteins may also self-assemble into other  amyloid -like forms, so -called superstructures  16 
(Krebs et al. 2009, Babenko et al. 2011, Foderà and Donald 2014, Vetri and Foderà 2015) . Within 17 
this class , amyloid s pherulites are characterized by a fascinating architecture with a spherical 18 
symmetry consist ing of a central dense core from which  a low -density corona grows radially (Krebs 19 
et al. 2004, Krebs et al. 2005, Vetri and Foderà 2015) . Their radius spans from few  µm to mm and 20 
they are readily detectable by cross -polarized light microscopy due to their specific Maltese cross 21 
pattern originating from the radial symmetry imposed by the corona (Cannon and Donald 2013) . In 22 
vitro , and especially for globular protein s, spherulites formation can be thermally induced and often 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

they are also observed in vivo  in connection with Alzheimer´s disease (Exley et al. 2010, House et al. 2 
2011) . 3 
Isolating the key interactions  determining size, morpholog y and structural features of amyloid 4 
species  is pivotal . Indeed,  such a variability may reflect  different biological roles  (Breydo and 5 
Uversky 2015, Iadanza et al. 2018)  both in neurodegenerative diseases  (Taylor et al. 2002, Petkova 6 
et al. 2005, Cohen et al. 2015)  and in terms of immunological response s (Bergström et al. 2005) . Also, 7 
in the context of therapeutics development,  the diversity of  protein composites  offer s an opportunity 8 
for realization of tailored materials (Fennema Galparsoro et al. 2021, Norrild et al. 2021) . This could 9 
result in materials  e.g. for encapsulati on of  different active compounds (Maji et al. 2008 , Shimanovich 10 
et al. 2015)  and materials with tunable rheological properties  (Haines -Butterick et al. 2007, Branco 11 
et al. 2009) . 12 
Co-solvents are often employed to tune protein -protein and protein -solvent interactions  (PPIs and 13 
PSIs, respectively)  during the aggregation process  and disentangle  the role of different PPIs in the 14 
reaction  (Vagenende et al. 2009, Bucciarelli et al. 2020) . Among the different co -solvents, surfactants 15 
are common ly used in pharmaceutical science s to tune protein formulation stability . Surfactants 16 
interact with protein s through electrostatic  and hydrophobic interaction s (Otzen 2011)  and reduce 17 
aggregation mainly via suppressing protein adsorption at surfaces (Parkins and Lashmar 2000) ; which 18 
is known to  catalyze the protein refolding reaction (Randolph and Jones 2002) . Moreover,  surfactants 19 
may direct ly bind to hydrophobic patches  on the protein surface, thereby reducing direct PPIs (Jones 20 
1992, Randolph and Jones 2002, Wang et al. 2008)  and lead to an overall enhanced stability of the 21 
protein ensemble (Chou et al. 2005) . Notably, the direct binding between surfactant molecules and 22 
the hydrophobic domains of partially unfolded protein often occurs at the critical micelle 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

concentration above which the surfactant start s to self -assemble into micelles .  2 
While the enhanced protein stability induced by surfactants is well documented , very limited 3 
information is available on the effect of surfactants on protein aggregation processes and on the 4 
features of the  final aggregate  structures , the latter being of vital importance for risk assessment of 5 
therapeutics . Indeed, secondary structure content, size , morphology and geometrical packing may 6 
alter the capability of the aggrega tes to induce immunoresponse (Filipe et al. 2010) . Siposova  et al. 7 
(2019 ) reported that the non -ionic surfactant Triton ™ X-100 affected insulin amyloid aggregation  at 8 
acidic pH  depend ing on the protein :surfactant  ratio, demonstrating that at concentration s below CMC  9 
insulin fibrillation was partially inhibited  and fibril morphology was greatly altered . Inhibition of in 10 
vitro  fibril formation was observed on a time scale of approximately 2 hours  when the concentration 11 
of detergent was above the CMC  (Siposova et al. 2019) ; this being ascribed to different  binding 12 
phenomena between Triton ™ X-100 and insulin dimer s.  13 
In the present work, we aim at investigat ing the mechanisms by which  polysorbate 80 (PS80 ) 14 
affects the stability and aggregation propensity of human insulin , with a special  focus on  the 15 
formation of aggregates other than fibrils, i.e. amyloid spherulites , and the related structural and 16 
morphological features . PS80  is a non -ionic surfactant and one of the main excipients added in protein 17 
formulations to maintain protein therapeutic activity and prolong the shelf life of the formulations  18 
(Jones et al. 2018) . Using a combination of spectroscopy and imaging methods , we reveal that PS80  19 
does not inhibit  the thermal aggregation  process for insulin  on a time scale of approximately 2 days , 20 
but rather delays the process . Surprisingly , addition of PS80  leads to  an increase in β-sheet structure 21 
and concomitant altered morphology and enhanced stability of the formed spherulites . This 22 
demonstrates  the importance of not only investigating the impact of excipient concentration on 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

2.1 Materials. Human insulin (91077C , ≥95%), Thioflavin T (ThT, ≥ 65% ), polysorbate 80  was 2 
obtained from Sigma Aldrich  (Saint Louis, MO, USA , ~70% oleic acid ). Boric acid (99.5% -100.5% ) 3 
and sodium hydroxide (≥ 99.0 % ) was acquired from Merck ( Darmstadt, Germany ). Acetic acid was 4 
obtained from VWR Chemicals (Leuven, Belgium , ≥ 98%). Sodium hydrochloride  was bought from 5 
Th. Geyer, CHEMSOLUTE  (Roskilde, Denmark, 99.0%).  6 
 7 
2.2 Sample Preparation.  3 mg/mL (0.52 m M) insulin was dissolved in 20% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.5  8 
M NaCl with the addition of increasing concentration of PS80. The pH value of the solution was 9 
approximately  1.7. 1 mL of sample was filtered through a 0.22 µm cellulose acetate  (CA)  filter  10 
(Labsolute, Th.Geyer, Renningen, Germany)  into a  1.5 mL polypropylene microtube  (SSIbio, Lodi, 11 
CA, US A). The concentration of insulin was determined by absorbance at 276 nm using an extinction 12 
coeﬃcient of 1.0, measured with Nanodrop  2000C (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, NC, USA) . The 13 
concentration is presented as an average of three measurements. T he aggregation was then thermally 14 
induced at 45 ℃ over 42 hours under quiescent conditions . Parafilm was used to seal the microtube s 15 
to limit evaporation.  Residual concentration of soluble insulin not converted into aggregated after 16 
formation of the spherulites was also measured with Nanodrop 2000C (Thermo Scientific, 17 
Wilmington, NC, USA).  The aggregation was then thermally induced at 45 ℃ over 42 hours under 18 
quiescent conditions. The formulation of insulin at acidic pH and incubation at high temperatures 19 
guarantee an in vitro  aggregation reaction occurring in the range of several hours. Thi s avoids 20 
extremely long aggregation reaction, which may induce artefacts in the experiments, e.g. due to 21 
sample evaporation or excessive chemical degradation.  At acidic pH and in presence of acetic acid, 22 
the conditions in this study, insulin is mainly in a monomeric state (Attri et al. 2010, Schack et al. 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity. It is made available under apreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted September 10, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455855doi: bioRxiv preprint  2018) , which is recognized as the building block for amyloid aggregate formation  (Ahmad et al. 2003) . 1 
As a consequence, such a formulation avoids the format ion of higher order oligomers as dimers 2 
(occurring in presence of HCl  (Attri et al. 2010) ) or hexamers appearing at physiological pHs and in 3 
presence of Zn2+ (Attri et al. 2010) , which may delay the a ggregation process.  4

2.3 Thioﬂavin T (ThT) Fluorescence Kinetics.  6 
A plate reader system ( CLARIOstar, Bmg Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) was used to monitor the 7 
ThT fluorescence. 200 µL solution was added in each well  of 96 -well black polystyrene plates  (Nunc, 8 
Thermo Fisher, Roches ter, NY, USA) , and for each sample there were four replicates. The plates 9 
were covered by polyolefin film (Thermo Fisher, Rochester, NY, USA)  to avoid evaporation  during 10 
the experiment . Samples were incubated at 45 °C without shaking for up to 42  hours . A stock solution 11 
of ThT consisting of  dissolved and filtered (0.22 µm CA filter) ThT in purified water  was stored at 12 
4 °C until use . The final concentration of ThT was 1 mM, determined by Nanodrop  at 412 nm using 13 
an extinction coefficient of 36 ,000 M-1 cm-1 (Groenning 2010) . 20 µL of ThT stock solution was 14 
added per 1 mL insulin solutions prior to distribution in  the plate  with subsequent incubation . The 15 
emission intensity at 480  nm was recorded upon excitation at 450  nm every 309 s throughout the 16 
incubation time. The experiment was repeated on four different batches with four replic ates for each 17 
batch (16 kinetic  curves obtained for each experimental condition). Results showed comparable 18 
profiles and data trend s and a representative dataset for one batch is shown in  the manuscript.  The 19 
time needed to reach 50% of the maximum fluorescence, t50%,  was determined as a measure of  the 20 
time scale of amyloid aggregation  kinetics (Foderà et al. 2008) .  21

Germany), measuring with the rod PL03  (Krüss, Hamburg, Germany ) at room temp erature  (RT) . The 2 
CMC was roughly identified as the breakpoint in the plot of surface tension versus  concentration of 3 
surfactan t. PS80  was dissolved in 20  %(v/v)  acetic acid with 0.5 M NaCl and data were collected at 4 
different PS80  concentrations. For each measurement, 5  mL of solution was added in the 5 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vessel  SV01 ( Krüss, Hamburg, Germany ). Each measurement was 6 
taken after allowing 1  min for equilibration; data were  record ed until the change was smaller than 7 
0.01 mN/m or for up to  2 min. Reported data were obtained as an average  of measurements of  three 8 
individual solutions with the same PS80  concentration.   9 
 10 
2.5 High Performance Liquid Chromatography for Polysorbate 80  Content Estimation   11 
The content of PS80  in the spherulites was determined by high performance liquid chromatography 12 
with evaporative light scattering detector ( HPLC -ELSD ). Specifically, the PS80  amount left in the 13 
supernatant after the formation of the insulin spherulites was estimated. The supernatant was obtained 14 
by centrifuging the spherulites samples at 9,279 g  for 10 min and 10 ℃ , using Centrifuge 5417R 15 
(Eppendorf, Hamb urg, Germany) . As controls, PS80  solvents without insulin were incubated under 16 
the same conditions as the insulin samples (45 ℃). The details of HPLC analysis regarding mobile 17 
phases, gradient and column are reported in the  supplementary materials.  18 
1 mL insulin spherulites samples after incubation were named as ( Ins_PS80 ) here. 1 mL PS80  19 
solution  was incubated (PS80 _incubated)  under the same condition s (45 ℃ for 42  hours ) as for the 20 
preparation of Ins_ PS80  samples . 1 mL of PS80  solution  (without insulin) was kept in the fridge 21 
(PS80 _Time0 ) as a control to evaluate potential evaporation induced by thermal incubation at 45 ℃. 22 
After 42  hours , the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 9,279 g  and 10 ℃ ; 0.5 mL supernatant 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

After these steps, 0.2 mL of 1 
the supernatant was transferred to HPLC vials  for concentration determination by HPLC -ELSD  (see 2 
supplementary materials ). The concentration of PS80  left in the supernatants  [𝑃𝑆80]Ins_PS80 was 3 
corrected for evaporation by the following equation:   4 
[𝑃𝑆80]Ins_PS80 _corr =[𝑃𝑆80]Ins_PS80 ×[𝑃𝑆80]PS80 _Time0
[𝑃𝑆80]PS80 _incubated 5 
Finally, the molar  PS80 :insulin  ratio of the spherulites w as calculated as:  6

Where [Ins] represent s the concentration  of insulin  (mM) in the spherulite s dispersed in  the liquid, 8 
and [PS80] is the  concentration  of PS80  (mM) remaining in the same spherulites  solution .  9

2.6 Molecular dynamic s (MD) and Pulling Simulations  11 
Full details of the various MD simulations are given in the supplementary materials.  12 
2.6.1 Insulin -PS80  Simulation in 0.5 M NaCl Solution at pH =2. 13 
The structure of insulin was derived from X -ray diffraction (Whittingham et al. 2002)  as deposited in 14 
the PDB database  (PDB entry 1GUJ) . The Amber force field was used  (Wang et al. 2000) . The PS80  15 
was modelled using the GAFF2 (Wang et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2006)  force field with Restrained 16 
ElectroStatic Potential ( RESP ) atomic charges  (Bayly et al. 1993)  found using the ACPYPE program  17 
(Sousa da Silva and Vranken 2012) . The simple point -charge ( SPC) (Berend sen et al. 1981)  water 18 
model was used. A single isomer of PS80  was constructed. 20 monomers of insulin and 20 PS80  19 
molecules were randomly positioned in a cubic simulation box of 20 × 20 × 20 Å3 and embedded in 20 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Periodic bou ndary conditions were invoked. After initial energy 1 
minimization and equilibration, 17 ns of MD simulation were conducted at constant temperature and 2 
pressure.  3 
2.6.2 PS80 -induced Insulin Dimer Free Energy by Umbrella Simulation . 4 
Two different simulations were performed to study the stability of insulin dimers in contact with 5 
PS80 . The force fields used for two simulations were the same as in section 2.6.1. The starting point 6 
for these simulations were obtained in the following way : a) Insulin dimer without PS80 ; the insulin 7 
dimer was obtained from the study of Whittingham et al . (Whittingham et al. 2002)  and the 8 
protonation adjusted to pH  2 by using the pKa values obtained from the PropKa server  (Olsson et al. 9 
2011) . b) Insulin dimer, similar to  the one in  simulati on (a), but with  one PS80  molecule attached to 10 
insulin on the opposite side of the insulin -insulin interface. The aggregated insulin -PS80  system was 11 
retrieved from the endpoint of the insulin -PS80 aggregation simulation described in 2.6.1.  12 
In both cases, the system was allowed to equilibrate similar  to the method used in 2.6.1, in a cubic 13 
box with periodic boundaries wherein there was SPC water and 0.5 M NaCl including neutralizing 14 
counterions. Following this equilibration, the system was simulated  at 300 K for 10 ns, under which 15 
the a ssemblies  remained stable.  16 
The pulling -simulations and umbrella sampling were performed as follows. Structures from the end 17 
of each of the trajectories were used as starting points. The aggregates were placed in a rectangular 18 
box with dimensions sufficient to satisfy the minimum ima ge convention and provide space for 19 
pulling dimension to take place along the z -axis. The insulin dimer was placed so that the pull along 20 
the z -axis was perpendicular to the plane of the dimer interface. As before, SPC water was used to 21 
represent solvent, and 0.5 M NaCl was present in the simulation cell. Equilibration was performed 22 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

the same methodology as described above.  2 
Following equilibration, restraints we re removed from all molecules except insulin monomer A; this 3 
was used as an immobile reference for the pulling simulations.  For each of the simulations, insulin 4 
monomer B was pulled away from monomer A over 500 ps, using a spring constant of 1000 kJ mol-1 5 
nm-2 and a pull rate of 0.01 nm ps-1. A final center -of-mass (COM) distance between monomer A and 6 
B of approximately 5.5 nm was achieved. From these trajectories, snapshots were taken to generate 7 
the starting configurations for the umbrella sampling window s. 8 
The number of windows sampled for each simulation was 20, sampled asymmetrically to ensure a 9 
thorough sampling of the configurational space during the dissociation of the aggregate. In each 10 
window 10 ns of MD was performed. Analysis of the results was p erformed with the weighted 11 
histogram analysis method (WHAM) (Hub et al. 2010)  as implemented in  the GROMACS 5.1.1 12 
software package  (Abraham et al. 2015) . Binding free energies were derived by analysis of the one - 13 
dimensional potential of mean force (PMF) curves a long the pulling direction. A boot -strap method 14 
was used to assess the error of the derived free energies.  15

lifetime imaging measurements were acquired in the time domain by means of a picoHarp 300 11 
standalone TCSPC module ( PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany ). 256 × 256 images were acquired at a 12 
scanning fr equency of 400 Hz and Leica “white light” laser was used to excite ThT (λ ex=470 nm, 13 
λem=485 -550 nm)  (De Luca et al. 2020, Fennema Galparsoro et al. 2021)  14 
Data analysis was performed by means of  the SimFCS  4 program (Laboratory for Fluorescence 15 
Dynamics, University of California, Irvine, CA, available at www.lfd.uci.edu). FLIM calibration of 16 
the system was obtained  by measuring the known lifetime of fluorescein , which shows  a single 17 
exponential decay with characteristic lifetime of 4.0 ns  (Wang et al. 2013) . 18 
A “phasor analysis” was performed for FLIM measurements , see details in (Digman et al. 2008, 19 
Ranjit et al. 2018) . Briefly,  it is a Fourier domain technique, which allows the transformation of the 20 
fluorescence decay from each pixel in the image to a point in the phasor plot. All possible single 21 
exponential lifetimes lie on a 0.5 radius semicircle going from point (0, 0) to point (1, 0), 22 
correspond ing to τ=∞ and τ=0, respectively . As phasors follow the vector algebra, a multicomponent  23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

lifetime components . As an example,  a double exponential decay would lie within the universal circle 2 
on the line connecting the two single  exponential components .  3

2.9 Fourier Transform Infra Red Microscopy (Micro -FTIR)  5 
Insulin spherulites were prepared as described in section 2.2 . Spherulites in microtubes  were isolated 6 
by centrifugation at 9,279 g , 10 ℃ for 10  min. The s upernatant was carefully discarded,  and the pellet 7 
wash ed with D 2O to remove remaining H2O and salt. The samples were centrifuged again , the 8 
supernatant removed and replaced by 1 mL of fresh D 2O, and finally  kept in D 2O overnight to allow  9 
H-D exchange.   10 
Micro -FTIR measurements were performed at RT using a LUMOS Fourier transform infrared 11 
microscope (Bruker , Billerica , MA, USA ), equipped with a photoconductive MCT detector with 12 
liquid nitrogen cooling. Visual image collection was performed via a fast digital CCD camera 13 
integrated in the instrument.  Aliquots of aggregated samples in D 2O were placed between two CaF 2 14 
windows separated by a 17 m Teflon spacer, ensuring a common path length for all absorption 15 
measurements. FTIR spectra were acquired in transmission mode between 4000 and 700  cm−1, with a 16 
spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. Each spectrum represents an  average of 128 scans  in a 25  m × 25 m 17 
size region of interest . Spherulites with higher density were not measurable in the present 18 
configuration.  19

Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA). After 42  hours of incubation, spherulites were pelleted after 2 
centrifug ation for 10 min at 9,279 g  and 10  ℃. The s upernatant was removed, and 1  mL of deionize d 3 
water was added to resuspend the spherulites. A second cycle of centrifugation (10 min at 9,279 g  4 
and 10  ℃) and subsequent removal of supernatant was used to wash the spherulites . The obtained 5 
highly  concentrated suspension  in the pellet  was taken out wit h a plastic pipette and place d on a glass 6 
slide for drying overnight at ambient conditions . Dried  samples were then mount ed on carbon tapes 7 
and sputter coated with 0.2 nm gold with Leica EM ACE200 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) 8 
before imaging. Images were acquired at an acceleration voltage of 2 kV. Void interspaces were  9 
observed  on the surface of the spherulites . The  areas of these void interspaces was quantified  based 10 
on SEM images of the spherulites at magnification of 6500 × and a t least seven spherulites for  each 11 
sample were analyzed. The area was determined by image J, according to the brightness difference 12 
between dark void interspaces and the surroundings.  Area s were calculated by automatic counting of 13 
the pixels constituting the  dark void interspaces . The number of pixels for the dark spots was then 14 
transformed into an area depend ing on the spatial resolution of the specific micrograph . Significant 15 
irregularities on the spherulites  surface  were avoid ed by manual zone selection . The void interspaces 16 
were separated into different groups (bins)  with a bin width of 0.1 µm2 between 0.05 and 6 µm2 (first 17 
bin 0.05 -0.1 µm2; last bin 5.9-6.0 µm2). Fractional d istribution was calculated from the A/A s ratio, 18 
where A is representing the total area of void interspaces of a specific  bin, and As the total area of all 19 
void interspaces . An example is shown in  supplementary materials  Figure S 2. 20

Figure S 3. 1 mL of each spherulite sample (3  mg/mL insulin aggregated with different concentrations 2 
of PS80 ) was centrifuged twice  for 10 min at 9,279 g  and 10 ℃. After the 1st centrifugation step, the 3 
supernatant was discarded and 1  mL purified  water was added to resuspend the spherulites. After the 4 
second cycle, the supernatant was removed and 1  mL 0.1 M boric acid-NaOH (pH 9) buffer was 5 
added.  The buffer was prepared by adding 309 mg boric acid and 65 mg NaOH  in 50 ml purified 6 
water, pH was adjusted by  using 5N HCl and 5N NaOH. The pH value of the solutions was checked 7 
after washing.  Spherulites in the pH 9 buffer were kept at RT and, at different time points  within 120 8 
hours, the sample was centrifugat ed (10 min at 9,279 g and 10 ℃)  and 100 µL supernatant out of the 9 
total volume of 1 mL was withdrawn  for concentration determination of insulin released from the 10 
spherulites. 100  µL buffer was added after each time point of sample withdrawal to reestablish t he 11 
original volume of the solution.  Spherulites samples were resuspended by  gently  turning the 12 
microtube s up and down. Insulin concentration was determined by Nanodrop 2000C  as previously 13 
mentioned. Experiments were repeated on two different bat ches of spheruli tes for each sample and 14 
three replicates for each time point  were analyzed.  15

3.1 PS80  Affects the Kinetics of Insulin Spherulite Formation  3 
As a first step, we monitored the insulin aggregation kinetics at different PS80  concentrations using 4 
ThT fluorescence. ThT is known to increase its quantum yield when in complex with aggregates of 5 
amyloid origin (Stsiapura et al. 2008) . 6 
 7 
Figure 1. Kinetics of spherulite formation: (a) Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence kinetics for insulin at different 8 
concentrations of PS80 (Mean ± SD, n=4). 3 mg/mL ins ulin was dissolved in 20 %(v/v) acetic acid, 0.5 M 9 
NaCl solution, pH 1.7, at different PS80 concentrations and incubated at 45 ℃ for 42 hours. ThT conc entration 10 
was 20 µM. Measurements are normalized to the plateau value. (b) Surface tension measurements o f different 11 
concentrations of PS80 in 20% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 1.7 in the absence of insulin (black circles, 12 
Mean ± SD, n=3) and the rate of aggregation 1/t 50% (blue squares, Mean ± SD, n=4). Three samples of each 13 
PS80 concentration w ere measured for the surface tension measurements. The 1/t 50% was calculated according 14 
to the data from Figure 1. (c) Residual concentration of soluble insulin after 42 hours of incubation (Mean ± 15 
SD, n=3). (d) ThT intensity  value  at the plateau .  16 
 17 
As shown by the normalized ThT kinetics (Figure 1 a, kinetics prior normalization can be found in 18 
Figure S4 in SI ), the presence of PS80  significantly affect ed the aggregation kinetics by modif ying 19 
both the lag time  and the  growth rate in a concentration -dependent manner. In absence of PS80 , the 20

At 1 
0.52 m M and 5 .17 mM PS80 , the lag time was > 5 hours , and the  further growth of the signal  2 
proceed ed over a period of several hours, showing that the presence of the surfactant also affect ed 3 
the growth rate. To obtain a model -free rate constant of the process , the inverse of the time at which 4 
the reaction reached 50% of its completion (1/t 50%) was determined . In Figure 1b, both the 1/t 50% and 5 
the surface tension of the insulin -PS80  solutions are plotted as a function of the PS80  concentration. 6 
1/t50% (blue symbols in Figure 1b) drastically decreased at increasing PS80  conce ntration  up to [PS80 ] 7 
= 0.05 mM  with less pronounced, but still detectable changes for  [PS80 ] > 0.05 mM. Interestingly, 8 
surface tension measurements (black symbols in Figure 1b)  indicates  that the CM C is approximately 9 
0.05 mM . This may suggest a role of PS80 micelles in affecting the aggregation. Notably , we 10 
measured the residual insulin concentration not converted into aggregates after 42 h ours of incubation 11 
(see methods) and estimated that >96 % of the initial native insulin molecules was converted into 12 
aggregates at the tested  PS80  concentration s (Figure 1c) . Interestingly, in both the samples of highest 13 
and lowest concentration of PS80 tested, we verified by hig h performance liquid chromatography 14 
(see section 2.5) that the surfactant was incorporated into the aggregates. Specifically, we found that 15 
at the highest PS80 concentration, the molar ratio of PS80 to insulin in the spherulites was around 16 
1:4.6 (5.1% (w/w )), and 1:30.3 (0.9% (w/w)) in the second highest PS80 concentration . It is worth to 17 
note that the ThT value at the plateau decreased at increasing concentration of PS80 (see Figure S4 18 
in SI). Such an effect can be determined by a number of factors, including specificity and accessibility 19 
of ThT binding sites, and the macro scopic properties of the binding site environment.  20 
Taken together, the data in Figure 1 show s that PS80  affect ed the insulin amyloid aggregation kinetics, 21 
causing a significant  increase in the  lag time , in particular at concentrations higher than the CMC . 22 
PS80  did not change the conversion efficiency of native protein into aggregates , but it was 23 
incorporated into the inner structure and/or onto the surface  of the aggregates . Moreover, s pherulites 24 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

resulting in different quantum yield of the dye  and fluorescence values at the plateau of the kinetics  2 
(see Figure 1d and  Figure S4  in supplementary materials ). Notably, the addition of PS80 to the 3 
starting solutions did not change the secondary structure of insulin . There is  no significant difference 4 
detected by CD, with all the spectra show ing a native α -helix structure profile prior to incubation  5 
(Figure S 5). Similarly, no differences were detected in the near-UV CD  region (data not shown) . 6 
 7 
3.2 PS80  Affects Insulin -Insulin Interactions  8 
The pronounced effect of PS80  on the lag time as displayed in Figure 1 is likely connected to the 9 
ability of insulin molecules to effectively interact with each other, either by direct PPIs or PSIs  (Choi 10 
et al. 2014, Månsson et al. 2014, Arosio et al. 2015, Holubová et al. 2021) . Indeed, a similar effect 11 
was previousl y reported for insulin in presence of ethanol, with an increase of the lag time due to the 12 
decrease of the dielectric constant of the medium and an ethanol -induced change of the protein 13 
hydration (Vetri et al. 2018) .  14 
We used molecular dynamics  simulations  to investigate the molecular interactions and binding 15 
between insulin molecules in presence and absence of PS80 . Specifically, comparison of two 16 
configurations corresponding to insulin solution and insulin in presence of PS80 , respectively,  was 17 
done. Mixtures of 20 insulin molecules with 20 PS80  molecules  correspond  to the experimental 18 
condition of 0.52 mM PS80 . For an insulin system in absence  of PS80  and within a  simulation time 19 
range of 20 ns , we only observe d the occurrence of monomers (Figure 2a ).  20 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

(green) molecules. (c) Complexes created from the simulation in b). Red color on the protein surface in (a), (b) 3 
and (c) indicates hydrophobic region of the molecules.  (d) Pulling experiment by molecular docking. The 4 
pulling simulation on the dimers is performed by immobilizing one insulin monomer, while the other is pulled 5 
away using a harmonic force. The PS80  molecule is not constrained during the pulling experiments. The free 6 
energies of interaction were estimated based on a weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) of sampled 7 
configurations along the reaction coordinate. The error associated with the energy minima is ±4 kJ/mol for 8 
each system.  9 
 10 
Interestingly, a differ ent scenario occurs when PS80  is added. PS80  interacts with insulin , generating 11 
four different complexes (Figure 2b and 2c) with PS80  mainly binding to insulin hydrophobic 12 
residues (see T able S1 in supplementary materials) . Moreover, we note that insulin tends to  form 13 
dimers in presence  of PS80  within the timescale of the simulations  (see complex 3 in Figure 2c) . 14 
These dimers have a small interaction interface, and are therefore rather weakly bound compared to 15 
the dimers observed in the crystalline state  (Whittingham et al. 2002) . We hypothesize that the 16

timescales inaccessible by our atomistic simulations. For such strongly bound dimers, corresponding 2 
to the crystal dimer, we calculated the free energy need ed to separate the two insulin molecules 3 
(Figure 2d), retrieving information on the binding energies between insulin molecules. For insulin 4 
dimers in absence of PS80 , 92 kJ/mol (37 kT) is needed for the dissociation. This value is barely 5 
altered when  PS80  is bound on the external part of one of the monomers within the dimer (96 kJ/mol 6 
or ~39 kT) . 7 
The MD simulations suggest  that the presence of PS80  generated a more heterogeneous sample with 8 
a propensity to form dimer s. Insulin amyloid self -assembly at acidic pH  value s is considered to 9 
proceed via aggregation between monomers (Brange et al. 1997, Frankær et al. 2017) , while 10 
formation of dimers is consi dered to increase the stability of insulin  against fibril formation (Vinther 11 
et al. 2012) . Thus, the increased tendency to form dimers with increasing PS80  concentration may 12 
explain the observed delay of the aggregation process (Figure 1a).  It is also worth noting that insulin 13 
aggregation is known to be highly catalyzed in presence of different types of surfaces (Foderà et al. 14 
2009, Li and Leblanc 2014) . When adsorbed to an interface with high surface tension, proteins can 15 
increase their exposed area in contact with the surface (Randolph and Jones 2002) , givin g rise to 16 
nucleation points from which aggregation  may develop (Nayak et al. 2008) . The addition of surfactant 17 
decreases the surface tension, reducing protein adsorption (Randolph and Jones 2002)  and in turn the 18 
catalytic effect of surface. Reduced adsorption  may thus also have  contribute d to the delay of the 19 
aggregation process.  20

microscopy analysis of the aggregated samples (Figure 3a). The characteristic Maltese cross -pattern 2 
is detected for all the samples, confirming the presence of spherulites. Spherulites are also readily 3 
detectable via confocal microscopy using ThT staining (Figure 3b).  4

 12 
Both in Figure 3a and 3 b, in absence and at low concentrations of PS80 , individual spherulites are 13 
observed within the sample s. The scenario changes when [ PS80 ] ≥ 0.05 mM  (above CMC) , where  14 
spherulites tend ed to form either cluster s or large mesoscopic agglomerates that extend ed up to 15 
hundreds of µm  (Figure. 3 a and b) . Furthermore,  by visual inspection of the microtube s, spherulites 16 
formed at [PS80 ] ≤ 0.01 mM (below CMC) appear ed to be distributed on  the wall of the microtubes , 17

At [PS80 ]> 0.05 mM (above 1 
CMC  and in correspondence to the formation of spherulite cluster s), the aggregates tend ed to 2 
sediment ( Figure 3 c). The presence of PS80  likely reduces the  surface tension of the interface between 3 
solution and microtube  walls  (Khan et al. 2015) . In our study , this phenomenon  likely suppress ed 4 
protein adsorption  and the consequent formation of highly concentrated insulin areas in proximity of 5 
the surfac e. This would reduce the influence of  surface -catalyzed phenomena  in the aggregation 6 
process , and nucleation in  the bulk becomes more significant than at lower PS80  concentrations . This 7 
apparently leads to the  formation of larger µm-sized  clusters  in the bulk, which readily sediment ed 8 
(arrows in Figure 3c).  9 
To further investigate the morphological features of spherulites and the surface properties of the 10 
aggregates, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results of SEM measurements are 11 
reported in Figure 4.  12

determined by evaluating the dark (black) areas on each spherulite.  7 
 8 
Isolated spherulites  with a pronounced roughness of the surface  were observed in absence of PS80 . 9 
In contrast , in presence of PS80  at concentrations higher than 0.05 mM, a pronounced clustering 10 
among the spherulites was observed and the spherulite surface appears smoother  (Figure 4a). This 11 
was confirmed by a quantitative analysis of surface roughness . We evaluate d the roughness as the 12 
distribution of void int erspaces on the surface (Figure 4c). A broad flat distribution, spanning from 13 
few tens of nm2 to six µm2, characterized the surface of the spherulites formed in absence of PS80  14 
(Figure 4c). In contrast , at increasing PS80  concentration s spherulites present ed a surface with void 15 
interspaces that peak around 500 nm2 (Figure 4c), confirming the marked difference that can 16 
qualitatively be appreciated from the SEM images (Figure 4b). This may indicate  a higher packing 17 
density  of proteins  within the  spherulites  formed in the presence of  PS80 .  18

3.4 PS80  Affects the Molecular Structure of Insulin Spherulites  20 
Data in Figure 4 support the idea of a PS80 -induced modification of the morphology of the spherulites, 21 
which may reflect different molecular organization within the whole structure.  To gain information 22 
on this aspect , we combined  FLIM and the phasor approach using ThT and m icro-FTIR . In Figure 5a 23

dye experience s three main distinguishable (see Figure S6 for better visualisation)  and quite 5 
heterogeneous environments. Interestingly, the lifetime of ThT gradually increased with the addition 6 
of PS80 . Measured  lifetime distributions in the phasor plot clearly lie on a straight line connecting 7 
two points . This  indicate s the possibility  of describing  measured ThT fluorescence decays using a 8 
double exponential model .  9

where the mono -exponential components ( with characteristic lifetimes 1 and 2) can be identified via 11 
the intersection of  the straight line with the universal circle . In our case we can identify two 12 
characteristic ThT lifetimes at 1=0.7 ns (blue circle) and 2=2.4 ns (red circle) . Distances between 13 
each lifetime distribution  and the single exponential phasors on the universal circle (F 1 and F 2) 14 
represent the fraction of each component (Digman et al. 2008, De Luca et al. 2020) . In the inse rt in 15 
Figure 5a, we report  the obtained F1 fraction s as a functi on of the PS80  concentration and in Figure  16 
5b representative 256  × 256 lifetime maps  obtained for samples at  different PS80  concentrations  were 17 
color  coded  on a scale from blue (pure fast component, 1 =0.7 ns) to red (pure slow component, 18 
2=2.4 ns). F1 dependence on the PS80  concentration clearly showed a biphasic behaviour . A high F 1 19 
value was found at PS80  concentration s below the CMC ( ~0.05 mM) whilst  at increasing surfactant 20 
concentrations the F1 value was reduced by more than 50% and remained constant  at the highest 21 
concentrations of PS80 . Importantly , Figure 5b reveal s that spherulites formed at concentrations of 22 
PS80 above or below the CMC  were characterised by a homogenous lifetime within the structure  (see 23 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

(two different lifetime distributions ) coexists in t he same sample  (see also Figure S6) .   2 
Interestingly, double exponential  decays were previously observed for ThT in different systems and 3 
related to peculiar properties of ThT environment with different rigidity  (Stsiapura et al. 2008, 4 
Thompson et al. 2015)  or to specific properties of the binding sites (Biancalana and Koide 2010, 5 
Sulatskaya et al. 2010, Lindberg et al. 2015, Ivancic et al. 2016, Sidhu et al. 2018) . In a previous 6 
study  using phasor approach for insulin spherulites samples , we found ThT fluorescence decays with 7 
same characteristic lifetimes as shown in the present study (De Luca et al. 2020) . We attribute ThT 8 
lifetim e changes  within different aggregates structures  to the superimposition of two main effects: 9 
the rigidity of the environment  (due to the molecular -rotor nature of ThT  (Stsiapura et al. 2008, 10 
Thompson et al. 2015)  and the specificity of  ThT binding site, which depends  on the details of the β- 11 
sheet architecture . More specifically, we established a clear  correlation  between differences in ThT 12 
lifetime and peculiarities of intermolecular β-structures : higher  ThT lifetimes correspond to higher 13 
content  of β-structures  (De Luca et al. 2020) . Based on that, data in Figure 5a and 5b suggest that 14 
PS80  induce d the formation of spherulites with higher content of intramolecular -structures. In 15 
addition to this, d ifferent ThT binding modes  and affinities may occur in spherulites formed at 16 
different PS80  concentration s, also affecting  the observed ThT lifetimes . Stronger H -bonds and/or 17 
longer -chains may indeed add more constraints and a higher rigidity to the ThT binding site with 18 
the outcome of inhibiting more effectively the non -radiative ThT rota tion, eventually increasing the 19 
fluorophore’s lifetime.  20 
The FTIR spectra acquired on  single  spherulites  formed in the absence of PS80  (cyan ) and at 0.51 21

difference in the secondary structure content . For both samples, t he spectr a were normalized to 1675 23

aggregated -sheets (1670 -1680 cm-1) (De Luca et a l. 2020) . Insulin spherulites formed at high 3 
concentration of PS80  had a higher content of aggregated -sheets compared to the aggregates formed 4 
in absence of PS80 , confirming the change in internal structure inferred from the  FLIM analysis.  5

 3.5 PS80  Affects the Stability of Insulin Spherulites in Alkaline Conditions  7 
The previous sections show that the addition of PS80  changed the aggregation kinetics, morphology, 8 
and molecular structure of insulin spherulites, which may relate to differences in aggre gate stability. 9 
Electrostatics forces are known to affect the stability of amyloid aggregates, and alkaline conditions 10 
promote the disassembly of insulin amyloid fibrils, leading to a release of soluble insulin molecules  11 
(Shammas et al. 2011, Santangelo et al. 2016) . The stability of spherulites were therefore tested 12 
against critical pH change by dispersing them in an a queous solution at pH 9 to achieve disassembly 13 
kinetics within a reasonable time frame .  14 
Figure 6a displays the dissociation kinetics of insulin spherulites formed at different PS80  15 
concentrations. Specifically, we monitored the concentration of soluble insulin released from the 16 
aggregates over time in boric acid buffer at pH 9 relative to the total insulin content in the spherulites.  17 
Independent of the PS80 concentration , spherulite s show an initial fast release followed by a much 18 
slower sustained release of soluble insulin . Notably , the  spherulites formed at [ PS80 ]> 0.05M 19 
release d soluble insulin species corresponding to ~30 -40% of the initial mass of spherulites, while a 20 
release  up to ~60% was detected for [ PS80 ]<0.05M.  21

Figure 6. Stability of insulin -spherulites in pH 9 buffer . Dissociation  and release of soluble insulin  profile s for 3 
different insulin spherulites. The data is presented as the percentage of the amount of insulin released to the 4 
initial mass of insulin spherulites.  Three spherulites  samples of each PS80 concentration were included in the 5 
test (Mean ± SD, n=3).  6 
 7 
Interestingly,  a sustained release of soluble insulin species was observed up to 5 days (Figure 6a). 8 
These data suggest an enhanced stability of the spherulites formed at high PS80  concentration. No 9 
insulin release was observed within the same time -frame  when the spherulites were  suspended  in 10 
buffer s at pH value s of 1.7 , 5 and 7  (Figure S 7).  11 
When spherulites formed at  pH 2 were exposed to pH 9, deprotonation of glutamic acid (pKa of side 12 
chain is 4.3), the carboxylic acid termini (pKa is 3.3), histidine  (pKa of side chain is 6.5) and the N 13 
termin i (pKa is 8.0)  likely t ook place  due to  increased  net negative charge (Pace et al. 2009, Shammas 14 
et al. 2011) . This in turn will enhance the electrostatic repulsive forces  between  amino acids within  15 
the aggregates  and likely contribute to  the dissociat ion of  spherulites.  The deprotonation of the two 16 
N-termini on insulin appear s to be crucial to facilitate disassembly and subsequent release, as minor  17

The enhanced stability for the spherulites containing high 1 
amounts of PS80 can be ascribed to the high degree of compactness of the structure (Figure 4) and 2 
the significant amount of  hydrogen bonds  involved in  the β-aggregate structure s.  3

Conclusions  5 
In this  study, w e present the effect of PS80  on the self -assembly mechanism, structure, morphology 6 
and stability of insulin amyloid -like spherulites. PS80  induce d a delay in the onset  of amyloid 7 
spherulites formation . This delay may be ascribed to the  ability of PS80  to induce  insulin dimers with 8 
increased stability against aggregation  and to modify the surface properties of the sample holder, 9 
reducing surface -catalysed aggregation . Interestingly, t he addition of this surfactant did not affect  the 10 
total amount of insulin converted into aggregates. However, at increasing PS80  concentration, the 11 
level of clustering of amyloid spherulites  was greatly affected,  with a threshold around the CMC 12 
value for the surfactant . Moreover, w hen formed in solution with [ PS80 ] > CMC, the spherulites 13 
acquire d a very dense packing of the structure with an increase in  the amount of  β-sheet structure. 14 
This confer red an increased stability to the spherulites  when exposed to  alkaline conditions . Avoiding 15 
the appearance of protein particles  in pharmaceutical products is one of the most challenging tasks in 16 
pharmaceutical science s. The presence of surfactants like polysorbates is known to delay protein 17 
aggregation. Our findings point out that the ad dition of PS80  may alter not only the protein 18 
aggregation kinetics, but also the physicochemical properties of the  protein  aggregates.  Such a change 19 
in properties is not obvious from single morphological assessment s and requires a set of  specific 20 
analytical methods. Further investigation is needed to evaluate w hether the change in aggregate 21 
properties highlighted in our work has any impact on safety and efficacy. Importantly , using 22 
controlled self -assembly of  biomolecular complexes has been widely discussed (Gupta et al. 2010, 23 
Tufail et al. 2018)  including the possibility to exploit s pherulites as carrier s for drug deliver y (Jiang 24 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

In this regard, our data may pave the way towards the use of co -solute s to alter the  1 
stability  and morphology of the final structure , giving the opportunity to meet  the different demands 2 
for target applications.  3

(ELSD)  2 
The high -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consist ed of an Agilent 1200 Series 3 
HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a quaternary pump and 4 
auto-injector coupled to a 1260 Infinity evaporative  light scattering detector (ELSD ) (Agilent 5 
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).  In-house nitrogen supply from University of Copenhagen was 6 
used as the source of the nitrogen gas for  the ELSD. An HPLC column Gemini C18, 150 × 4.6 mm, 7 
3 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used in the experiment. The mobile phase A consisted 8 
of 5% (v/v)  acetonitrile (VWR, ≥ 99.9 %, Radnor, PA, USA), while mobile phase B consisted of 95 % 9 
(v/v)  acetonitril e. Both phases also contain ed 0.1 %(v/v)  trifluoroacetic acid (Merck, ≥99.0%, Saint 10 
Louis, MO, USA). The grad ient conditions were as follows:  11 
During the first 5 min of the analysis time , mobile phase B was maintained at 0% , and subsequently  12 
increased linearly to reach 60% at 6 min and 80% at 10 min. After maintaining 80% B from 10 to 15 13 
min, the mobile phase was changed back to 0% B at 15.1 min, and the column was equilibrated until 14 
20 min. Both the evaporator and the nebulizer temperature o f the ELSD were maintained at 45 ℃. 15 
The gas flow rate was set to 1.6 SLM.  16 
The concentration of PS80 standard solution varied from 0.1 mg/ mL to 1 mg/ mL. The plot of log 17 
ELSD area versus  log PS80 concentration showed a linear relationship (R2 > 0.99), the l imit of 18 
quantification was 0.0067 mg/ mL (0.051 mM).  19 
 20 
Molecular Dynamic Modulation Conditions  21 
The insulin structure was obtained from the study of Whittingham et al . (Whittingham et al. 2002)  as 22 
deposited in the PDB database (reference code 1GUJ). O ne monomer was used. The protonation of 23 
the insulin molecule was adjusted to pH  2 by use of the pKa values obtained from the PropKa  server 24 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

A single isomer of PS80  1 
was used with x = 9, z = 3, y = 3, w = 5 according to the labeling system in Figure S 1. The PS80  was 2 
modelled using the GAFF2 (Wang et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2006)  force field with RESP atomic 3 
charges found using the ACPYPE program (Sousa da Silva and Vranken 2012) . The SPC (Berend sen 4 
et al. 1981)  water model was used. 20 monomers of insulin and 20 PS80  molecules were randomly 5 
positioned in a cubic simulation box of 20 × 20 × 20 Å, to which 0.5 M NaCl was added, including 6 
neutralizing counterions. Periodic boundary conditions wer e invoked.  7 
The system was energy minimized and subsequently equilibrated in two steps, with position restraints 8 
applied to the peptide heavy atoms throughout. The first phase involved simulating for 100 ps under 9 
a constant volume (NVT) ensemble. Protein a nd nonprotein atoms were coupled to separate 10 
temperature coupling baths, and temperature was maintained at 310 K using the Berendsen weak 11 
coupling method (Berendsen et al. 1984) . Following NVT equilibration, 100 ps of constant pressure 12 
(NPT) equilibration were performed, also using weak coupling (Berendsen et al. 1984)  to maintain 13 
pressure isot ropically at 1.0 bar.  14 
Production MD simulations were conducted for 20  ns in the absence of any restraints. These MD 15 
simulations were performed using the GROMACS 5.1.1 software package (Abraham et al. 2015) . 16 
The electrostatic and van der  Waal forces were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald approach 17 
(Darden et al. 1993) . The leap -frog algorithm was used as integrator together with the velocity 18 
rescaling thermostat (Bussi et al. 2007)  and th e Parrinello -Rahman barostat (Parri nello and Rahman 19 
1981) . 20 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Change the image type to 8 -bit. Adjust the threshold of the image. Use the slider bars to set 1 
the threshold range, until the red area only contains  open spaces (Figure S 2b).  2 
3. Analyze – Analyze Particles. Set the size (µm2) as 0.05 -6.00. Select “show outlines ”. After 3 
clicking  on “OK”, a list of areas of the chosen spaces should show, together with a drawing of 4 
all the chosen spaces (Figure S 2c).  5 
By follow ing the steps above, void interspaces  were  selected . Analysis was performed on seven 6 
spherulites for each PS80 concentration . The number of spaces analyzed for each PS80 7 
concentration is in the range 2000 -14000 . 8

Steps for the measurement of s oluble insulin dissociated  from spherulites:  2 
 After removing the water from the supernatant, 1 mL buffer  (pH values were 1.7, 5, 7 and 9)  3 
were added.  4 
 Spherulites in the buffer were kept at room temperature ( RT) for 120 hrs. At 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 5 
24, and 120 hrs, the spherulites samples were centrifuged under the specified condition s. 0.1 6 
mL of the supernatant was taken out for measuring the insulin concentration. Each 7 
measurement was repeated  3 times, with 3 spherulites samples  measured for each PS80 8 
concentration . The average value was reported as the final result.  9 
 During sampling  0.1 mL of fresh boric acid -NaOH buffer was added to the spherulites 10 
sample s to reestablish  the original volume. S amples were resuspended every time after the 11 
fresh buffer was added.  12

The ThT fibrillation kinetics without normalization is shown in Figure S4. As mentioned in section 2 
2.3 of the main article , 3 mg/mL insulin was dissolved in 20 %(v/v) acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 3 
1.7, with increasing concentration of PS80. The insulin so lutions were incubated in 96 well plates at 4 
45 ℃ for 42 hrs. ThT was added using a final concentration of 20  µM. The addition of PS80 led to a 5 
longer lag time. Interestingly, a decrease of the maximum fluorescence was also observed (Figure 6 
S4). Upon PS80 a ddition, the plateau of the kinetic curves was reduced, especially when the 7 
concentration of PS80 was above 0.52 mM. This likely was due to fewer binding sites for ThT, as the 8 
total conversion of insulin into aggregates was similar for all samples.  9

Thermal Incubation  2 
Secondary structure of insulin dissolved in 20 %(v/v) acetic  acetic  acid, 0.5 M NaCl solution, pH 1.7, 3 
at increasing concentration of PS80 was recorded by CD. CD spectra were collected at 20 ℃ on a 4 
Chirascan CD s pectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK), the settings were as 5 
follows: 1 nm  data interval, 1 nm  bandwidth, 2 nm/s scanning speed. 3 mg /mL insulin was dissolved 6 
in solutions containing PS80 in the  concentration range from 0 mM to 5.17 mM. Cuvettes with a  50 7 
µm path length  (Type 19 Demountable U -Shaped Circular Dichroism Cuvette, FireflySci  Cuvette 8 
Shop, NYC, NY , USA) were  used in this experiment. Far -UV CD of  insulin was recorded in the 9 
range of 19 0-260 nm. The presented data for each sample are  an average  of five scans. Figure S5 10 
shows that, apart from a slight variation at 192 nm, the addition of PS80 did not significantly change 11 
the overall shape of the CD spectrum from 200 nm to 260 nm, with all  spectra mainly showing a 12 
dominant α -helix structure prior to incubation.  13

Different PS80 Concentrations  2 
Using phasor analysis each pixel of the intensity images is mapped to a point in the phasor plot 3 
corresponding to the measured fluorescence lifetime. Single exponential lifetimes lie on the so -called 4 
“universal circle”; long lifetimes are located near the origin (0 on the x axis), while short lifetimes 5 
are shifted on the circumference toward the bottom right intersection with the x axis (1 on the x axis)  6 
(Digman et al. 2008) . Phasors  placed inside the universal circle indicate that ThT lifetime in these 7 
conditions is characterised by by mutiple  exponential decay s. In the lifetime maps (Figu re S6a) pixels 8 
are colored by selecting colored ROIs in the polar plot (Figure S6b). When overlapping the 9 
populations (Figure S6c), 3 distributions  can be observed:  one, in green , corresponds to the samples 10 
below CMC (0.05  mM) of PS80 with shorther fluores cence lifetime. A population in red corresponds 11 
to the samples above the CMC of PS80 and has the longest lifetime , while  an intermediate population 12 
in pink corresponds to the samples formed at the CMC value. When fluorescence lifetime 13 
distributions of samples at different concentration of P S80 are plotted on the same phasor plot, they 14 
lie on a straight line. Hence, a quantitative analysis shown in Figure 5 can be performed splitting the 15 
population into two single exponential fluorescence decays  (De Luca et al. 2020) . 16

Spherulites Dissociation and the Release of Soluble Insulin in Solutions at pHs 1.7, 5 And 7  8 
The tested spherulites did not dissociate in buffers at pH values  of 1.7, 5 , and 7. The pH 1.7 buffer 9 
corresponds to the acetate buffer used in the spherulite preparation process (without PS80).  Acetate 10 
buffer (pH 5) was prepared by dissolving 288.6 mg sodium acetate (Merck, ≥99.0%, Darmstadt, 11
