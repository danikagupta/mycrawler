Clinical and Pharmacological Effects 
of Monoamine Precursors or Haloperidol 
in Chronic Schizophrenia 
MANY psychotropic drugs have been shown to interfere 
with monoamine metabolism in the brain1•2• Recently, 
interest has been focused on tryptophan and 5-hydroxy­
tryptamine metabolism in mental depression3•4• During 
combined treatment with tryptophan and a monoamine 
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in healthy volunteers, mental 
effects described as drunkenness and hyperreflexia 
appeared•. In schizophrenic patients, the same combina­
tion of drugs caused central nervous stimulation and 
varying effects on the disease symptoms•-& (reviewed in 
ref. 9). In contrast, 5-hydroxytryptophan also in combina­
tion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is reported to 
have no such effects on schizophrenic patients7•10• This 
discrepancy may depend on an accumulation of tryptamine 
after treatment with MAOI and tryptophan but not 5-
hydroxytryptophan. Because of these findings we have 
made therapeutic investigations of schizophrenic patients 
given single doses of monoamine precursors and at the 
same time made repeated estimations of acid monoamine 
metabolites in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid. Ashcroft 
et at. have pointed out that ventricular CSF rich in acid 
monoamine metabolites might reach tho lumbar tap site 
if large amounts of cerebrospinal fluid were tapped11• In 
our study, however, the concentration of the acid 
monoamin e metabolite which was uninfluenced by the 
treatments was unaffected by repeated tapping of the 
lumbar fluid. 5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and 
homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebrospinal fluid were 
estimated by the methods of Roos12 and Anden, Roos 
and Werdinius13• Our patients had been in hospital for 
many years, and 14 days before these studies were under­
taken all treatment was stopped. 
One patient was given 50 mg ofDL-5-hydroxytryptophan 
intravenously. No mental effects could be observed and 
there seemed to be no discomfort. On the other hand there 
were considerable changes in the concentration of 5-
hydroxyindole acetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid 
{Table 1).

Another patient was given 50 mg of r,-DOPA with no 
side effects nor apparent influence on the mental state. 
The concentration of homovanillic acid in the cerebro­
spinal fluid was, however, increased (Table 1). Bernheim er 
~t a/.14 gave 50 mg of L-DOPA intravenously to both 
normal subjects and patients with various organic brain 
diseases but did not obRerve any changes of the con­
centration of homovanilli<' acid in the cerebrospinal fluid. 
In two schizophrenic patients who, by mistake, hap­
pened to receive intravenous haloperidol, 20 and 40 mg, 
respectively, we could measure the concentrations of 
homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in 
the cerebrospinal fluid at intervals up to 24 h after 
injection. These patients had previously been treated 
with large doses of other neuroleptics but without effect. 
After the injections of haloperidol-they wore free of 
other drugs-tho patients were moderately sedated and NATURE. VOL. 217 . MARCH 2. 1968 
showed mild orthostatic symptoms. Patient No. 4 (who 
received 40 mg) had a moderate hand and foot tremor 
for 4 days but showed no rigidity or motor unrest. There 
were no changes in the mental state despite mild sedation. 
The concentration of hornovanillic acid in cerebrospinal 
fluid in this patient doubled within 6 h of tho injection. 
The patient who received 20 mg of haloperidol showed 
no change in the concentration of homovanillic acid in 
the cerebrospinal fluid (Table 1). It has been shown 
experimentally that after doses of haloperidol or chlor­
promazine comparable with those used in psychiatric 
therapy, homovanillic acid in the corpus striatum in­
creases significantly16-17• It was therefore surprising that 
only after doses of 40 mg was there a noticeable change in 
the concentration of homovanillic acid in the cerebro­
spinal fluid. In dogs, however, a similar phenomenon has 
been encountered. A dose of 0·3 mgfkg of haloperidol in­
creased the homovanillic acid in the corpus striatum more 
than 100 per cent but had no influence on the homo­
vanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid (unpublished re­
sults of H. Andersson).

MICROBIOLOGY 
Isolation of Salmonella tyl'himurium 
Mutants with Increased Recipient 
Ability by the Use of R Factor 
SEXUAL recombination occurs only at very low frequencies 
between Escherichia coli Hfr and Salmonella typhimurium 
recipients• -•. Frequencies of transfer of R factors' from 
E. coli R+ to S. typhimurium R-are also very low (10-7/ 
donor)7• Thus a characteristic feature of the mating of 
E. coli with S. typhimurium is the low recipient ability of 
Salmonella strains. The low recipient ability of Salmonella 
was overcome by isolating fertile mutants by an indirect 
selection method in S. typhimurium LT-7 mut•. We 
reported that these fertile mutants are rcstrictionless and 
modificationless for foreign deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
