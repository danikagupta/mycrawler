Abstract
The nitrite threshold concentration in rearing
water of African catﬁsh ( Clarias gariepinus ) was
assessed. African catﬁsh with an initial mean (SD)
weight of 219.7 (57.8) g were exposed to an
increasing range of water nitrite from 6 (Control)
to 928 lM nitrite for 28 days. Mean (SD) plasma
nitrite concentrations increased from 5.0 (3.6) to
32.5 (12.6) lM at 928 lM ambient nitrite. The
increase in nitrite was accompanied by gradual
increase in plasma nitrate from 41.6 (28.4) lMt o
420.2 (106.4) lM. Haematocrit, haemoglobin,
methemoglobin, plasma concentrations of cortisol,
glucose, lactate, osmolality, gill morphology and
branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity were not
affected. Feed intake, ﬁnal weight, SGR, FCR and
mortality were not affected. We advise not to
exceed a water nitrite concentration of 43 lM
(0.6 mg L/C01NO2/C0-N) to prevent the risk of
reduced growth and feed intake in African catﬁsh
aquaculture.

Introduction
The aquaculture industry has been expanding
rapidly over the past four decades (FAO 2012). In(intensive) recirculation systems (RAS), water is
treated to allow the reuse of over 90% of the rear-
ing water (Bovendeur, Eding & Henken 1987;
Eding, Kamstra, Verreth, Huisman & Klapwijk
2006). In RAS, ﬁsh risk exposure to toxic levels of
nitrite. Nitrogenous wastes in RAS are managed
by nitriﬁcation (biological oxidation of ammonia to
nitrate) and denitriﬁcation (biological reduction in
nitrate to nitrogen gas) (Bovendeur et al. 1987;
Eding et al. 2006; Van Rijn 2010). Both processes
can cause nitrite accumulation in the rearing
water (Van Rijn & Rivera 1990).
Nitrite is very toxic to organisms, as it converts
haemoglobin (Hb) into methemoglobin (MethHb)
that does not carry oxygen (Kiese 1974). At high
external nitrite levels, ﬁsh reduce their overall
activity to reduce their oxygen requirement; this
goes, however, with the cost of impaired growth
and a series of vital functions (reviewed by Lewis &
Morris 1986). In freshwater, nitrite enters the
organism primarily via the chloride cells in the gills
(Bath & Eddy 1980). Nitrite has an afﬁnity for this
branchial Cl/C0/HCO 3/C0exchanger and therefore can
compete with the normal Cl/C0uptake mechanism.
This can lead to (partial) shift from Cl/C0uptake to
NO2/C0uptake when nitrite is present at high con-
centrations in the environment (Jensen 2003).
Therefore, ﬁsh with high branchial chloride uptake
rates are more sensitive to nitrite toxicity than
those with low uptake rates (Williams & Eddy
1986). This pertains in particular to freshwater

species, where active branchial uptake is the main
route of entry of anions (Jensen 2003). Elevatedchloride levels in the water are known to alleviatenitrite toxicity, due to competitive effects on bran-chial nitrite uptake (Crawford & Allen 1977). This
protective effect is not uniform between species
(reviewed by Lewis & Morris 1986).
African catﬁsh ( Clarias gariepinus ) is commer-
cially farmed in intensive RAS in the Netherlands(Van Duijn, Schneider, Poelman, Van der Veen &Beukers 2010). The global aquaculture productionof African catﬁsh has been increasing rapidly since2000. In 2011, 194 000 tonnes were farmed
globally (FAO 2011). The effects of chronic nitrite
exposure on African catﬁsh physiology and foodintake are not known. Most of the studies onnitrite toxicity determined the median lethal dose,LD
50, for several ﬁsh species with exposure times
up to 120 h. Chronic exposure studies are scarceand mostly limited to purely toxicological effects,with no attention to effects on growth parameters,
of interest to farmers (reviewed by Lewis & Morris
1986; Kroupova, Machova & Svobodova 2005).Hilmy et al. (Hilmy, El-Domiaty & Wershana
1987) exposed African catﬁsh for 6 months to228 lM of nitrite (1/10th of their 96 median tol-
erance limit). They observed a decrease in erythro-cytes counts, haemoglobin content and productionof methemoglobin. In our experimental design, we
exposed African catﬁsh to a range of nitrite
concentrations that allowed us to see subtle yetimportant effect on parameters of interest for ﬁshfarmers, without causing mortalities or serioustoxic effect.
For channel catﬁsh, Ictalurus punctatus , the
lowest concentration nitrite leading to growthsuppression after 31 days was 115 lM (44% of
the minimum concentration to induce mortality)
(Colt, Ludwig, Tchobanoglous & Cech 1981). Theminimum concentration causing mortality for thisspecies is about half of the 96-h LC
50(Bowser,
Falls, Van Zandt, Collier & Phillips 1983). There-fore, the minimum ambient concentration ofnitrite leading to detectable growth was set up atabout one-ﬁfth of the 96-h LC
50(Lewis & Morris
1986). This information was taken into account
when designing the experimental concentrationsrange. We exposed African catﬁsh to increasingwater nitrite concentrations [6 (Control), 111,280, 459 and 928 lM] for 28 days to assess the
nitrite threshold concentration for physiology,growth and food intake. In addition, we exposedtwo aquaria to high ambient nitrite concentrations
(921 lM) in the addition on sodium chloride
(350 mg L
/C01; 6 mM) to investigate the potential
attenuating effect of chloride on nitrite toxicity.
Materials and methods
Experimental conditions
African catﬁsh ( C. gariepinus ) were obtained from
Fleuren-Nooijen BV, Someren, The Netherlands.The treatment of the ﬁsh in the laboratory was inaccordance with Dutch law concerning animal
welfare, as tested and approved by the ethical
committee for animal experimentation of Wagen-ingen UR Livestock Research.
Fish ( n=192) were randomly divided over
sixteen 30-L rectangular glass (12 ﬁsh per tank),dark covered tanks and acclimatized to the experi-mental tanks for 15 days. During this acclimatiza-tion period, some ﬁsh with skin damage (due to
aggressive behaviour; n=6) were removed, result-
ing in some variation in number of ﬁsh per tank(10–12). After this period of 15 days, the behaviour
of the ﬁsh had stabilized, and nitrite exposure com-menced. At the start of the 28 days experiment, theoverall initial mean (SD) weight was 219.7 (57.8)g. The mean stocking density was 84.7 kg m
/C03,a
value below densities practised at commercial
farms for this size class (100 –300 kg m/C03, Van de
Nieuwegiessen, Olwo, Khong, Verreth & Schrama2009).
The experiment consisted of eight treatments, in
duplicate. Treatments were assigned randomly tothe 16 tanks. Treatment 1 was included to collectblood at the start of the experiment ( t=0). Fish in
treatments 3 –7 were exposed to one of ﬁve differ-
ent nitrite concentrations in the water: 6, 111,
280, 459 and 928 lM. Fish in treatment 2 (pair-
fed) were kept at control nitrite levels and pair-fedto the ﬁsh kept at 928 lM nitrite (treatment 7) to
discriminate between effects caused by low feedintake due to high nitrite in the water. Fish intreatment 8 (chloride) were exposed to high nitrite(921 lM) in the presence of sodium chloride
(350 mg L
/C01; 6 mM) to evaluate a potential atten-
uating effect of chloride (and sodium) on nitritetoxicity (Eddy, Kunzlik & Bath 1983; Stormer,Jensen & Rankin 1996; reviewed by Lewis &Morris 1986 and Kroupova et al. 2005). During
acclimatization and experimental periods, all tankswere supplied with local tap water via a header

tions range: 0.4 –0.7lM, Vitens Watertechnologie,
The Netherlands). Experimental nitrite concentra-tions were realized by infusion of NaNO
2(Merk,
Hohenbrunn, Germany) stock solutions prepared
in tap water (Table 1), which were pumped into
the tanks using a peristaltic pump (Watson Mar-low 505 S; Rotterdam, The Netherlands) at a ﬂowof 4.75 L day
/C01per tank; each tank was equipped
with an air stone positioned at the point of sodiumnitrite inﬂow to guaranty good mixing of theinfused stock solution with the tank water. Flowrates were monitored daily and adjusted when
necessary to reach the desired nitrite concentra-
tions. Nitrite concentrations were graduallyincreased to the desired concentrations during theﬁrst 4 days of the experimental period. Fresh stocksolutions (Table 1) were prepared daily during theﬁrst 11 days of the experimental period and in thisperiod nitrite (NO
2/C0-N), nitrate (NO 3/C0-N) and total
ammonia (NH 4+-N plus NH 3-N) concentrations
were monitored daily (NitriVer 3 TNT Reagent Set,
NitraVer X Nitrogen-Nitrate Reagent Set, Nitro-gen-Ammonia TNT, AmVer Reagent Set, tests forNO
3/C0,N O 2/C0and NH 4+, Hach Lange, D €usseldorf,
Germany, in a Hach DR/890 colorimeter, HachLange). During the remainder of the experimentalperiod fresh stock solutions were prepared weeklyand nitrite, nitrate and total ammonia concentra-
tions were monitored twice per week. Water tem-
perature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentrationswere monitored daily prior to feeding in all tanks(Hach Lange HQ 40 multimeter) throughout theentire experiment. Mean (SD) water temperaturewas 25.7 (0.5) °C throughout the experimental
period. Conductivity was measured with a WTWCond 315i (WTW GmbH, Weilheim in Oberbay-
ern, Germany), and presented in Table 1.
Blood sampling
On the day nitrite exposure started (day 0), ﬁsh in
treatment 1 ( t=0) were sampled. After 28 days of
exposure to nitrite, the ﬁsh from the seven remain-ing treatments were sampled (10 –12 ﬁsh per tank).
Fish were rapidly netted and anaesthetized in 0.1%
(v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,USA). Within 2 min, blood (2 91.0 mL) was
taken by puncture of the caudal vessels with atuberculin syringe ﬁtted with a 25-gauge needle;Na
2EDTA was used as anticoagulant. One 150
microtiter aliquot was immediately used for thehaematocrit determination and haemoglobin/
methemoglobin measurement. The remainder ofblood was immediately centrifuged for 10 min(14 000 g,4°C) and the plasma so obtained was
stored at /C020°C until further analyses.
Blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and
methemoglobin levels
Immediately after blood puncture, subsamples
were drawn into (heparinized) glass capillaries andcentrifuged (13 600 g; 2 min) to measure haemat-
ocrit values. Results were rounded to the closest
0.5%. Blood haemoglobin and methemoglobin
were measured with commercially available kits(Instruchemie, Delfzijl, The Netherlands; FARdiagnostics, Verona, Italy).
Plasma concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, cortisol,
glucose, lactate, chloride, plasma osmolality andbranchial Na
+/K+-ATPase activity
Plasma concentration of cortisol was determined
using radioimmunoassay as described in detail byGorissen et al. (Gorissen, Bernier, Manuel, de Gelder,
Metz, Huising & Flik 2012). Plasma osmolality wasmeasured using a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat030, Gonotec, Germany). Plasma concentrations ofglucose, lactate, chloride, nitrate and nitrite were
measured with commercially available enzymatic
kits adapted to 96-well plates as described recently(Schram, Roques, Abbink, Spanings, De Vries, Bier-man, Van de Vis & Flik 2010; Schram, Roques, Abb-ink, Yokohama, Spanings, De Vries, Bierman, Vande Vis & Flik 2012). Branchial Na
+/K+-ATPase
activity was measured as described by Metz et al.
(Metz, Van den Burg, Wendelaar Bonga & Flik
2003).
Gill morphology
From each ﬁsh a second gill arch was removed
immediately after blood sampling and placed over-night in Bouin’s ﬁxative (75 volumes saturatedpicric acid, 25 volumes saturated formaldehyde
and 5 volumes acetic acid) and then embedded in
parafﬁn. Gill sections were made to include thetrailing edge of the ﬁlament where in this speciesthe chloride cells reside. Gill sections were immunestained according to Dang et al. (Dang, Lock, Flik
& Wendelaar Bonga 2000) as described in detailfor African catﬁsh (Schram et al. 2010, 2012).

conversion rate
On day 0 and day 28, the ﬁsh in each tank were
individually weighed (Mettler PM 34 Delta range)to the nearest 1 g, to calculate the speciﬁc growthrate (SGR) as follows:
SGR¼ðlnðW

t;
where SGR =speciﬁc growth rate (% day/C01),Wt=
mean weight at day 28 (g), W0=mean weight at
day 0 (g) and t=number of days.
Floating feed (Catﬁsh type Me-3; Skretting,
Boxmeer, The Netherlands) with 49% crude pro-tein and 11% crude lipids was given twice dailyat 09:00 and 15:00 hours until apparent satia-tion (no more feed was taken for at least 5 minfollowing administration of the feed). Feed loadsper tank were recorded daily. All uneaten pelletswere collected from each tank 1 h after each of
the two daily feeding sessions. Feed loss per tank
was calculated as the total number of uneatenfeed pellets multiplied by 0.0966 g per pellet, theaverage weight of a pellet, determined by weigh-ing 100 feed pellets. Daily feed intake per tankresulted from the difference between daily feedload and daily feed loss. Daily feed intake pertank was divided by the number of ﬁsh in the
tank to calculate the daily feed intake per ﬁsh in
each tank (to account for different numbers ofﬁsh per tank). For each tank the total feedintake per ﬁsh (TFI) was determined by summa-tion of daily feed intake per ﬁsh in each tank.Total feed intake per ﬁsh and biomass increaseper ﬁsh were used to calculate feed conversion
rate (FCR) as follows:
FCR¼
TFI
ðWt/C0W0Þ
where FCR =feed conversion rate (g/g), TFI =
total feed intake (g per ﬁsh), Wt=mean individual
weight at day 28 (g) and W0=mean individual
weight at day 0 (g).
Statistics
Physiological parametersPhysiological parameters are expressed as mean
(SD) of the individual measurements per treat-ment. For each tanks, 10 –12 ﬁsh had been
sampled; in some instances not all samples wereanalysed because of insufﬁcient volume or ﬁshmortality. Data were log transformed (if required)to obtain residuals that were normally distributedand to obtain homogeneity of variance of residu-
als across treatment levels. Mean values for physi-
ological parameters were tested for differencesamong the treatments using linear mixed models(REML) with treatments as ﬁxed effects and tankas a random effect ( F-tests with Kenward –Roger
approximation to the residual degrees of freedom;Kenward & Roger 1997). Statistical analyses wereperformed in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). Only when signiﬁcant treatment effects
were detected, a least signiﬁcance difference (LSD)post hoc analysis was used to estimate the levelof signiﬁcance between mean values. For bothREML and LSD analysis the ﬁducial limit was setat 5%.Table 1 Composition of the treatment-speciﬁc stock solutions, the predicted* nitrite and sodium concentrations, the

tions were related to water nitrite concentrations
using linear regression analyses (Table 2).
Feed intake and growth
Initial and ﬁnal individual weight, TFI, SGR and
FCR are presented as mean values per treatment(Table 5). Mean values per treatment were logtransformed to obtain residuals that were approxi-
mately normally distributed and to obtain homo-
geneity of variance of residuals across treatmentlevels and then tested for signiﬁcant differencesamong the treatments using one-way
ANOVA in
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). For both ANOVA and
LSD analysis the ﬁducial limit was set at 5%.
Concentration –effect curves
Nitrite concentration –effect curves were ﬁtted for
SGR and TFI using a log-logistic model (Seefeldt,Jensen & Fuerst 1995). As a blank could not beincluded, the effects are expressed as absolutevalues. Curve ﬁtting was carried out with theMarquadt and Levenberg algorithm (Mor /C19e 1978)
in R (the 10% effect concentrations (EC
10)) and
their 95% conﬁdence limits were calculated (Miller
& Miller 2000).
Results
Plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations
We observed a signiﬁcant linear increase in plasma
nitrite concentration with increasing ambient
nitrite concentrations (Tables 2 and 3). Basal val-
ues for the control group were 5.0 (3.6), increasingup to 32.5 (12.6 lM) in the highest NO
2/C0treat-
ment. Similarly, a signiﬁcant linear increase inplasma nitrate was observed with increasing ambi-ent nitrite concentrations (Tables 2 and 3). Basalplasma nitrate concentrations for the control groupwere 41.6 (28.4 lM), increasing up to 420.2(106.4 lM) in the highest NO
2/C0treatment. The
addition of sodium chloride to high ambient NO 2/C0
(treatment 8) did not show an attenuating effect
on both plasma NO 2/C0and NO 3/C0concentrations.
Blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and
methemoglobin
No signiﬁcant differences in haematocrit and
methemoglobin levels after 28 days of exposure to
any of the ambient nitrite concentrations weredetected (Table 4). Signiﬁcant differences inhaemoglobin were detected among treatments(Table 4), but within the same (narrow) biologicalrange, marginal differences could not be related totreatments.
Plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, chloride, plasma
osmolality and Na
+/K+-ATPase activity
No signiﬁcant differences in plasma concentration
of cortisol, glucose, lactate, chloride, plasma osmo-lality and branchial Na
+/K+-ATPase activity were
observed (Table 4). All values were within normalranges previously reported for African catﬁsh,
C. gariepinus (Schram et al. 2010, 2012).
Gill morphology
Gills stained for Na
+/K+ATPase-rich cells (chloride
cells) are presented for the control group (Fig. 1a),928 lMN O
2/C0(Fig. 1b) and 921 lMN O 2/C0in
addition with NaCl (Fig. 1c). Gill morphology was
not affected by elevated NO 2/C0exposure.
Total feed intake, speciﬁc growth rate, feed
conversion rate and mortality
Daily feed intake appeared to cumulate to marked
treatment effects on TFI (Fig. 2). However, no sig-niﬁcant treatment effect on TFI could be detected.Table 2 Results of linear regression analyses

The concentration –effect curves for total feed
intake and speciﬁc growth rate in relation to water
nitrite concentration (Fig. 3a and b) reveal a sig-
niﬁcant effect of nitrite. For total feed intake theEC
10for nitrite is 84 lM with a 95% conﬁdence
interval from 2 lM to 3.7 mM. For speciﬁc growth
rate the EC 10for nitrite is 43 lM with a 95% con-
ﬁdence interval from 0 to 68 M (data not shownon the ﬁgures).
Discussion
Blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and
methemoglobin levels
A primary toxic action of nitrite is the conversion
of haemoglobin into methemoglobin, which is notable to carry oxygen (Bodansky 1951). Basal
levels of methemoglobin in some ﬁsh species can
reach 10%, and as a rule of thumb, levels below50% generally do not result in mortality (Lewis &Morris 1986). At higher levels of methemoglobin(70–80%), the behaviour of ﬁsh is affected as they
become less active to reduce their oxygen demand.In some species, defence mechanisms exist andacclimatization can occur after a certain expositiontime (reviewed by Lewis & Morris 1986; Kroupova
et al. 2005). Pike-perch ( Sander lucioperca ) appears
unable to acclimatize when chronically exposedto 250 lMN O
2/C0, as mean methemoglobin levels
remained at 67% after 32 days of exposure(Wuertz, Schulze, Eberhardt, Schulz & Schroeder2013). African catﬁsh ( C. gariepinus ; 166 g)
exposed to 2.3 mM NO
2/C0for 96 h showed blood
methemoglobin levels to increase from 10 to 50%
after 24 h, and reaching 90% after 96 h (Hilmy
et al. 1987). Moreover, chronic exposure of Afri-
can catﬁsh to 1/10th of this dose (0.23 mM) overa period of 6 months led to a slight increase inmethemoglobin measured after 1 month (below15%), reaching a peak after 4 months (40%)followed by a decrease to 25% after 6 monthsexposure (Hilmy et al. 1987). Our data indicate
similar acclimatization process occurring in our
ﬁsh, with acute formation of methemoglobin athigh ambient nitrite concentrations (seen in theeuthanized ﬁsh) and basal levels reached after28 days of exposure.
Plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations
Plasma nitrite concentrations gradually increased
with increasing ambient nitrite concentrations(ranging from 1.0 to 13.7 lM in the control
groups and 13.1 to 56.6 lM in the 928 lM
group).
Plasma nitrite concentration varies among
species (Table 6). In some species, plasma nitriteconcentration can reach build up to levels of up0255075100125150175

1983). Juvenile African catﬁsh exposed to
1736 lMN O 2/C0for 24 h had plasma concentra-
tions on NO 2/C0reaching almost 5.5 mM (Ekwe,
Nwakpa & Nweze 2012). Exposure of adult Afri-can catﬁsh to high ambient nitrite concentrationseems to elicit a strong initial increase in plasmanitrite, but ﬁsh seem to acclimatize when chroni-cally exposed to high levels of ambient nitrite.
This is conﬁrmed by the fact that addition of
sodium chloride (6 mM) does not show a signiﬁ-cant attenuating effect on plasma nitrite concen-tration. African catﬁsh seem to acclimatize to therange of concentration studied; therefore, theaddition of sodium chloride does not add moreprotective effect.
Plasma nitrate concentrations gradually
increased with increasing ambient nitrite concen-
trations. This can be explained by the intrinsicdefence mechanism of conversion of plasma nitriteinto less toxic nitrate (Doblander & Lackner 1996,1997). African catﬁsh are very tolerant to nitrateexposure, as only their growth was affected whenambient concentrations reached 27.04 mM[plasma: 6.6 (0.9) mM] (Schram et al. 2012). Inthe current experiment, plasma nitrate concentra-
tions were well below the millimolar level, the
toxic effects observed should therefore be attrib-uted to nitrite rather than nitrate.
During the whole experimental period, no
abnormal swimming behaviour was observed as inother nitrite-exposed ﬁsh species (personal observa-tions; Lewis & Morris 1986). The absence ofabnormal swimming behaviour may be explained
by the air-breathing nature of African catﬁsh.
Branchial nitrite uptake could then be limited bylimiting oxygen uptake from the water in favourof air breathing. Quantitative observation ofair-breathing behaviour of nitrite-exposed Africancatﬁsh would be required to assess this hypothesis.

Plasma glucose, lactate and cortisol levels were in
the normal biological range measured in previousstudies for this species (Schram et al. 2010,
2012). A chronic exposure of 28 days to elevatedambient nitrite concentrations did not affect theseTable 6 Overview of nitrite plasma concentrations in several ﬁsh species under different acute and chronic nitrite

ance of the African catﬁsh towards high nitroge-nous waste compounds. Plasma osmolality andplasma chloride, a major determinant of plasmaosmolality, were not affected by high nitrite
concentrations. The Na
+/K+-ATPase activity was
in the range previously observed for this speciesexposed to ammonia (Schram et al. 2010). The
Na/K-ATPase activity was assessed only in thecontrol group (treatment 3), high nitrite (treat-ment 7) and high nitrite in presence of sodiumchloride (treatment 8). As no differences betweenthose extreme groups were observed, the interme-
diate groups were not measured. This enzyme does
not play a role in the nitrite uptake or removal ofnitrite as it was observed for ammonia (Schramet al. 2010). The branchial Cl
/C0/HCO 3/C0exchanger
which normally is involved in chloride uptake andmay be disrupted when ambient nitrite concentra-tions are high, causing a (partial) shift to NO
2/C0
uptake (Jensen 2003), was not investigated in this
study.
In rainbow trout exposed to several
increasing nitrite concentrations for 28 days,severe morphological alterations of the gills wereobserved already from the lowest 0.22 lMN O
2/C0,
culminating in the highest concentration (65.2 lM
NO2/C0) (Kroupova, Machova, Piackova, Blahova,
Dobsikova, Novotny & Svobodova 2008). Over
32 days of exposure to different nitrite
concentrations (0 –250 lMN O 2/C0), 40 –60% of the
gills of juvenile pike-perch showed abnormalities.Nevertheless, no changes could be related to treat-ment effects (Wuertz et al. 2013). Toxic effect of gill
morphology thus depends on the species.
Feed intake
During the ﬁrst 4 days of the experiment, when
nitrite concentrations were building up, feed intakewas similar among all treatments. However, whenthe desired concentrations of nitrite had beenreached (day 5), different pattern in feed intakeshowed up almost instantly (Fig. 2), with interme-diate patterns related to the different concentra-
tions, the minimum feed intake being reached in
the highest nitrite concentration group and apotential attenuating effect of the addition ofsodium chloride. Feed intake and SGR and ﬁnalweight patterns seem to be gradually affected byraising ambient nitrite concentrations (Table 5;Fig. 2). However, differences are not signiﬁcant.A pair-fed group was introduced to discriminate
effects of high nitrite exposure from potentialeffects of reduced feed intake. No signiﬁcant differ-ences were observed in physiological parametersfor any treatment.
Nitrite toxicity
The main mechanism of nitrite toxicity is well doc-
umented with the conversion of haemoglobin intomethemoglobin that is incapable of carryingoxygen (Bodansky 1951). The comparable methe-moglobin levels among treatments after 28 days of
nitrite exposure show that African catﬁsh is able
to acclimatize to relatively high ambient nitriteconcentrations. Similar methemoglobin concentra-tions were observed in this species exposed to1/10th of the 96 median tolerance limit (228 lM
NO
2/C0; Hilmy et al. 1987). Plasma nitrite concen-
trations gradually increased with increasing ambi-ent nitrite concentrations. The increase in plasma
nitrate with increasing water nitrite concentra-
tions indicates that African catﬁsh successfullydetoxify internally nitrite to less toxic nitrate asdescribed earlier in trout hepatocytes (Doblander &Lackner 1996). The addition of sodium chloride(6 mM) does not show a further attenuating effectboth regarding plasma nitrite concentration andgrowth parameters; African catﬁsh appears to
acclimatize to chronic nitrite exposure already
without sodium chloride; the addition of this com-pound has no real beneﬁcial effect in the concen-tration range studied.
The nitrite concentration range was designed
based on actual nitrite exposure in commercialAfrican catﬁsh aquaculture combined with valuesfrom the literature, and the aim of this experiment
was to measure subtle changes that could impair
the ﬁsh welfare. In our opinion, the set of dataobtained allows to draw conclusions regarding thenitrite toxicity to African catﬁsh and the thresholdconcentrations for safe aquaculture production.Previous studies on nitrite toxicity mainly focusedon acute LC
50up to 96 h (reviewed by Kroupova
et al. 2005). The parameters traditionally mea-
sured are mainly related to the nitrite effect on
blood haemoglobin and methemoglobin formation.In this study, we investigated, in addition to thoseparameters, the effect of chronic nitrite exposureon stress physiology and growth, parameters ofinterest from the welfare and commercial aquacul-ture points of view.

African catﬁsh chronically exposed to 1 mM ambi-
ent nitrite appears capable of mitigating theadverse effects of nitrite. The concentration effect
curves revealed a signiﬁcant effect of nitrite expo-
sure on total feed intake and speciﬁc growth rate.The concentration –effect curves do not provide a
clear-cut nitrite threshold concentration for Afri-can catﬁsh as the calculated EC
10values for nitrite
of 84 for feed intake and 43 lM for growth both
have very large 95% conﬁdence intervals. There-fore, the reported EC
10values should be treated as
indicative. All observations jointly taken we advise
for African catﬁsh not to exceed a nitriteconcentration of 43 lM. As stated earlier, several
studies investigated the acute lethal concentrationof nitrite for numerous species, but data regardingnitrite toxicity for chronic exposure, combiningphysiology and growth are scare. As an example,the NOEC and LOEC for juvenile rainbow
trout after 28 days of nitrite exposure were esti-
mated at 0.22 lMN O
2/C0(0.01 mg L/C01NO2/C0) and
4.34 lMN O 2/C0(0.2 mg L/C01NO2/C0) respectively
(Kroupova et al. 2008); which indicates that this
species is more sensitive to nitrite than Africancatﬁsh.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that African catﬁsh,
C. gariepinus , is tolerant to high ambient nitrite
concentrations over a period of 28 days. Nitriteaccumulates mildly in the plasma with increasingambient nitrite concentrations. The greaterincrease in plasma nitrate with increasing ambientnitrite concentrations provides a good indirect
evidence for internal nitrite detoxiﬁcation into less
toxic nitrate. Stress physiology and ionic balanceare not affected by high ambient nitrite concentra-tions. Growth and feed intake show a differentialpattern from the ﬁrst day of exposure, but differ-ences are not signiﬁcant.
We advise for African catﬁsh not to exceed a
water nitrite concentration of 43 lM (0.6 mg L
/C01
NO2/C0-N). Below this nitrite concentration physio-
logical and growth disturbances are avoided.
