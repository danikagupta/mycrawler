Abstract
For many applications pertaining to neuroimaging, social science, international re-
lations, chemometrics, genomics and molecular-omics, datasets often involve variables
which are best represented in the form of a multi-dimensional array or tensor , which
extends the familiar two-way data matrix into higher dimensions. Rather than vec-
torizing tensor-valued variables prior to analysis which results in loss of inference, new
methods have emerged developing regression relationships between variables with ei-
ther tensor-valued response(s) or predictor(s). Bayesian approaches, in particular, have
shown great promise in applications pertaining to tensor regressions. A remarkable fea-
ture of fully Bayesian approaches is that they allow exible modeling of tensor-valued
parameters in the regressions involving tensor variables and naturally oer characteri-
zation of uncertainty in the parametric and predictive inferences. This paper provides
a review of some relevant Bayesian models on tensor regressions developed in recent
years. We divide methods according to the objective of the analysis. We begin with
tensor regression approaches with a scalar response and a tensor-valued covariate, dis-
cuss both parametric and nonparametric modeling options and applications in this
framework. We then address the problem of making inference with a tensor response
and a vector of covariates, with applications including task related brain activation
and connectivity studies. Finally, we oer discussion on Bayesian models involving a
tensor response and a tensor covariate. Discussion of each model is accompanied by
available results on its posterior contraction properties, laying out restrictions on key
model parameters (such as the tensor dimensions) to draw accurate posterior inference.

Introduction
Of late, scientic applications in a variety of disciplines encounter datasets where one
or more variables are multidimensional arrays or tensors, which are higher dimensional
analogues of two dimensional matrices. For example, tensor objects are encountered in
molecular-omics proling with high dimensional data involving multiple subjects, tissues,
uids or time points within a single study [26]. Similarly, in functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG) data, multidimensional arrays are common
with dierent dimensions signifying time points, brain regions or frequencies [12]. Again,
there can be time varying tensor valued objects in international relational data with dimen-
sions signifying countries, time points, and diplomatic actions [25]. Scientic objective in
such applications often pertains to developing regression relationships with either a tensor-
valued response or a predictor.
A few early approaches consider reshaping tensor variables to high dimensional vectors
before employing them to regression analysis [67]. Reshaping tensors introduces massive
dimensional unstructured vectors in the regression framework. Applying ordinary Bayesian
variable selection (see stat05788 ) or shrinkage priors on coecients of high dimensional
predictors causes computational havoc. Additionally, this may result in loss of spatial infor-
mation in the tensor cells. An alternative approach within the regression framework envisions
tensor variables as high dimensional functional variables to take into account the spatial in-
formation in them. Several penalized functional regression approaches have emerged in the
last decade or so, mainly with functional predictors [20, 48, 68, 30, 16, 14, 61, 49], though
many of them may face computational issues with large tensors due to incorporating ex-
pensive cross validation procedures for choosing the tuning parameters. Other important
approaches include two stage procedures which rst conduct a dimension reduction step
with a tensor variable, and then t a model using lower dimensional summaries of the tensor
variable (t) [7]. Similar to the reshaping approach, two stage approaches may also lose
inference due to somewhat ignoring the inherent spatial information in the tensor variables.
2Rather than summarizing the tensor objects in one way or another, novel approaches have
appeared to directly incorporate a tensor valued response or predictor in regression frame-
works, mostly in the frequentist paradigm. To this end, [68] propose a generalized linear
model framework involving a scalar response and a tensor predictor in which the tensor pre-
dictor coecient is assumed to have a low-rank Cannonical Parallel Factor (CP/PARAFAC)
decomposition [33], which is a higher dimensional analogue to factor modeling in two dimen-
sions, formally introduced later. [39] extend the framework to incorporate a more general
Tucker decomposition of the tensor regression parameter. Both these models allow for the
incorporation of sparsity-inducing regularization for the tensor parameter. Various exten-
sions of such tensor regression frameworks have appeared to address relevant practical issues.
For example, a more ecient estimation algorithm of the tensor parameter is proposed in
[63], while [60] propose regularization using the total variation penalty on the tensor pa-
rameters and argue for it as a more suitable option when the tensor predictor is a piecewise
smooth image with jumps and edges. There is also some literature on regressions with a
tensor response and scalar predictors. For example, [44] consider an approach with a tensor
response and scalar predictors. While they assume a low-rank structure on the tensor coef-
cient, no sparsity is enforced on the tensor coecient. [38] propose an alternative strategy
following the literature on envelope-based regression models [11], that utilizes a generalized
sparsity principle to exploit the redundant information in the tensor response, by seeking
linear combinations of the response that are irrelevant to the regression. In the same vein,
[55] develop an approach that assumes low-rank decomposition of the tensor coecient and
imposes element-wise sparsity on individual cells of the tensor coecient, thus oering vari-
able selection in the tensor response regression paradigm. In the frequentist literature of
tensor on tensor regression, [46] oer theoretical results under convex regularization with
the tensor nuclear norm, though computation of tensor nuclear norm is NP-hard [55, 13].
In comparison, there is a limited Bayesian literature on tensor regressions. Bayesian
frameworks in tensor regressions have shown great promise in eective modeling of tensor
valued parameters with careful construction of priors that naturally induces sparsity within
and across tensor margins and provides model based estimation of tuning parameters. In
addition, the need for valid measures of uncertainty on parameter (predictive) estimates is
3crucial, especially in settings with low or moderate sample sizes, which naturally motivates
a Bayesian approach. This article provides a review of the most relevant Bayesian modeling
approaches to tensor regression, which have mostly appeared in the last few years. We
divide the article into a few sections according to the modeling objective. We begin with
the review of tensor regression approaches with a scalar response and a tensor covariate.
Such settings are typically useful in neuroimaging studies which usually record resting state
fMRI and brain related phenotype data over a number of subjects. The main objective of
such studies pertains to understanding relationships between dierent brain regions with the
phenotype of interest. We discuss the parametric tensor linear model under this setting,
provide an overview of novel multiway structured shrinkage priors specically developed to
draw inference, and then extend our discussion to the class of Bayesian non-parametric tensor
regression models. Theoretical results laying out conditions for posterior consistency have
also found brief mention in this section.
Another important area of Bayesian tensor regression pertains to regression settings with
a tensor response and either a vector or a tensor valued predictor. An application of a tensor
response with a vector predictor is found in task related brain activation studies. In a typical
task-related fMRI experiment, the brain is scanned at small intervals while a subject per-
forms a series of tasks [32, 31, 62, 66, 64]. The objective is to identify brain regions activated
by an external stimulus. The Bayesian tensor response regression framework having brain
scans as the tensor response with task-related predictors directly ts into drawing inference
in single- and multi-subject brain activation studies. The review discusses tensor response
regression models and the development of shrinkage priors on tensor parameters to draw e-
cient posterior inference. We extend the discussion on Bayesian tensor response regression to
Bayesian mixed eect tensor response regression models which nd an important application
in the joint estimation of brain activation and connectivity for multi-subject studies. Con-
nectivity signies the interaction between brain regions to assess how information is shared
across brain regions. We focus upon functional connectivity that seeks to determine brain
regions with similar neuronal activity. We will additionally oer a brief discussion on some
important theoretical developments in these models laying out sucient conditions on the
tensor dimensions, sparsity, and magnitudes of cell entries to achieve optimal estimation of
4tensor coecients.
As part of the review, we briey mention some of the recent literature on Bayesian
tensor-on-tensor regression. This regression framework is directly motivated by a plethora of
important application, including temporal modeling of international relational data [25], the
prediction of fMRI from EEG data [12] and the prediction of gene expression across multiple
tissues from other genomic variables. We begin by reviewing tensor on tensor regression
models which assume that the response and predictor tensors have the same number of
modes. We also discuss a more general framework that allows response and predictor tensors
to have dierent number of modes [41]. Finally, we briey review extensions of tensor on
tensor regressions with a time varying tensor response. While the review draws motivations
for various approaches mainly from neuro-scientic applications, the methods reviewed in this
article lend themselves to the analysis of datasets emerging from various other applications.

A mode-dber of aD-way tensor is obtained by xing all dimensions of a tensor except

1 Bayesian Tensor on Scalar Regression Model
1.1 Parametric Bayesian Tensor on Scalar Regression Model
Neuroscientic studies often involve 3-dimensional resting state fMRI scans, along with
age, gender and other behavioral variables and brain related phenotypes for a number of
subjects [40, 34]. The phenotypes of interest can be continuous, binary (e.g., presence or
absence of a neuronal disease) or categorical (e.g., dierent levels of a specic disorder).
In these applications, the inferential interest lies in predicting the brain related phenotype
based on the fMRI scan (treated as a tensor object) as well as from behavioral variables.
Further, it is of specic interest to identify the regions in the brain (alternatively, the cells
in the tensor predictor) that are predictive of the response. Let y2Y denotes a response
variable, with z2 X  RpandX2 
D
d=1Rpdbeing the scalar and tensor predictors,
respectively. Depending on the nature of the response (continuous, binary, categorical or
count), a generalized tensor regression model is proposed in these contexts as below
E[yjX;z] =g 1
y(+z0+hX;Bi);hX;Bi= vec(X)0vec(B); (2)
7wheregy() is an appropriate link function, is ap1 coecient for scalar predictors
andB2
D
d=1Rpdis the tensor coecient corresponding to the measured tensor predictor
X. [19] consider the tensor linear regression model with gy() as the identity link function,
whereas [6] discuss binary tensor regression model with zero-inated logit link.
Without imposing any additional structure on the coecient tensor B, its estimation
involvesQD
d=1pdparameters. To reduce the number of free parameters, a rank-R PARAFAC
decomposed structure is commonly adopted for B[68, 19]. Under the assumed rank- R
PARAFAC decomposition for B, model (2) requires estimating RPD
d=1pdas opposed to
QD
d=1pdparameters for the unstructured B. To appreciate the extent of dimension reduction
oered by the PARAFAC decomposition, notice that with a tensor predictor of dimension
303030, the unstructured Brequires estimating 27000 parameters, whereas the rank-R
PARAFAC structure involves only 90 Rfree parameters. In many applications, R5 15
seems sucient, the number of free parameters ranges between a couple of hundreds to
couples of thousands. As pointed out by [19], such a reduction in the number of parameters
facilitates computationally ecient estimation of B. However, the imposed decomposition
induces a nonlinear relationship between tensor margins and cell entries in B. In particular,
thev= (v1;:::;vD)th cell entry of Bis given by B(v1;:::;vD)=PR

interested in identifying geometric sub-regions of the tensor in which coecients are not
close to zero, with the remaining elements being very close to zero, one wonders whether
such a dramatic dimension reduction retains sucient exibility. We will return to this
question in due course with sucient theoretical justication.
Although the tensor coecient Bis identiable, [19] comments on non-identiability of
tensor margins b(r)
d,d= 1;::;D ,r= 1;:::;R . Constructing a prior distribution on the tensor
margins after adding necessary identiability restrictions turns out to be inecient. Instead,
[19] propose a new class of prior distributions on tensor margins to draw ecient posterior
inference onB(rather than on tensor margins) ignoring any identiability constraints, and
observe rapid convergence for the tensor parameter B. To elaborate, the multiway Dirichlet
generalized double Pareto (M-DGDP) prior introduced in [19] induces two types of shrinkage
in estimating B. Shrinkage across ranks (or summands in the PARAFAC decomposition)
takes place in an exchangeable way, with global scale Ga(a;b) adjusted in each rank

shrinkage towards lower ranks in the assumed PARAFAC decomposition. In addition, Wdr=
diag(wdr;1;:::;wdr;pd),d= 1;:::;D andr= 1;:::;R are margin-specic scale parameters
for each component. The hierarchical margin-level prior is given by

prior achieves shrinkage across ranks as well as within a margin, and hence is coined as a
multiway shrinkage prior. Figure 3 shows a pictorial depiction of the prior. The choice of

prior is that the posterior full conditionals of most parameters are in closed forms, leading
to simple Gibbs sampling updates and rapid convergence [19].
An important question posed earlier is that if the dimension reduction step using the
low-rank factorization and subsequent prior structure on tensor margins limit exibility

consistency of the proposed model in estimating the regression function. The consistency
of Bayesian models and estimators are determined using the notion of posterior consistency
[15, 2, 4]. Let f(yjX;B) denotes the density of y, and assume that the true data generating
model also belongs to the class of tensor regression models with density given by f(yjX;B0).

To demonstrate practical application of tensor regression framework developed in this sec-
tion, a brief analysis of tensor regression is presented in a neuroimaging data. The dataset
records resting state fMRI and T1-weighted images of 776 subjects, either normal, or suf-
fering from attention decit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Information on demographic
and behavioral variables for the subjects are also available. A binary tensor regression with
gy() as the logit link has been tted to the data considering binary indicators for subjects as
12responses and brain images as tensor covariates. The analysis reveals two regions of interest
signicantly associated with the ADHD: left temporal lobe white matter and the splenium
that connects parietal and occipital cortices across the midline in the corpus callosum (see
Figure 5); both these ndings are consistent with earlier studies. In fact, prior studies have
revealed prominent volume reductions in the temporal and frontal cortices in children with
ADHD compared with matched controls [53]. An earlier study has also recorded a reduced
size of the splenium in the corpus callosum being responsible for ADHD [58]. We refer to
[56] for more details on the data and analysis.
1.2 Nonparametric Tensor on Scalar Regression
In estimating regression relationships between a scalar response and a tensor predictor,
the bias-variance tradeo is a central issue, both from theoretical and practical perspectives.
In the parametric generalized tensor model discussed in Section 1.1, the function class that
the model can represent is critically restricted due to its linearity in the mean function and
the low-rank constraint, implying that the variance error is low but the bias error is high
if the true functional relationship between yiandXiis either nonlinear or full rank. An
alternative approach is to t the nonparametric tensor regression model to the data [67, 27]
given by
yi=f(Xi) +i;iiidN(0;2): (6)
Heref() can represent a wide range of functions and the bias error can be close to zero,
though at the expense of exibility due to the notorious high dimensionality associated with
estimating (6). In order to mitigate the burden of high dimensionality, [29] propose a new
class of additive-multiplicative nonparametric regression (AMNR) models. AMNR employs
low-rank decomposition for both the tensor predictor Xand the function f(), and hence is
referred to as a doubly decomposing nonparametric tensor regression framework.
To elaborate, [29] propose decomposing the tensor predictor X=PS

fAMNR() can be conceptualized as a rank-R PARAFAC decomposition of f() in an innite
space. In fact, any function in a Sobolev space of order can be approximated to any
degree by a function of this form, with each f(r)
d() belonging to a Sobolev space of order 
[21]. To estimate fAMNR(), each local function f(r)
d() is assigned a Gaussian process prior
distribution (see stat04542 ).
Interestingly, AMNR is interpretable as a piecewise non-parametrization of the tensor
model proposed in (2) with gy() as the identity link. Assuming BandXto have rank-R

Thus AMNR replaces hb(r)

approaches on nonparametric tensor regression, such as [52], which use the same vector
input for every f(r)
d() and restrict S= 1. Other prominent approaches in the context of
nonparametric tensor regression includes the Tensor Gaussian Process (TGP) model [67],
which is essentially a GP regression model that reshapes a tensor into a high-dimensional
vector and takes the high dimensional vector as a predictor. While tensor GP is found
to demonstrate satisfactory practical performance, AMNR derives additional advantage by
oering theoretical support for the class of nonparametric tensor regression models discussed
below.
Suppose ^fn() is the Bayes estimator for estimating f() with sample size n. Let the

true data generating model is given by (6) with the true regression function f() belonging
to the space of Sobolev functions of order . [29] mentioned two key assumptions in the
theoretical development of AMNR: (a) the true data generating regression function f()
and functions generated from the tted Gaussian process priors have the same degree of
smoothness; (b) f() satises a rank additivity condition which essentially implies that for

14in developing multivariate additive model analysis, see [23], [47]. Assume that fadmits
a rankSdecomposition in the sense of (7). [29] observed dierent convergence rates of

d=1pd). On the other
hand, when Sis innite, the convergence rate deteriorates by a factor due to a nite rank
approximation of f, details of which can be found in [29].
Before concluding this section, we would like to make an important observation. No-
tice that the existing literature on Bayesian tensor regressions assumes low-rank PARAFAC
decomposition either on the tensor parameter (Section 1.1) or on the regression function
(Section 1.2). There is a scope of imposing a more exible and expressive Tucker decomposi-
tion structure on them. While the dierence seems to be a minor one, it can have profound
eects, especially on neuro-scientic applications. For example, the freedom in the choice of
unequalRdsd= 1;::;D is essential when the tensor data are skewed in dimensions, which is
pretty common in EEG, with the temporal dimension often exceeding the spatial dimension.
Besides, the Tucker formulation may often be handy to achieve parsimony for datasets with
small to moderate sample sizes [39]. Considering these facts, we expect to see in future a
more exible Bayesian modeling with Tucker decomposition in the tensor regression contexts.
2 Bayesian Tensor Regression Models with a Tensor
Response
While regression with a tensor predictor and a scalar response is able to deliver inference
on many scientic problems in neuroscience and other disciplines, a variety of applications
also motivate models with a tensor response and a vector or a tensor predictor. For example,
detecting brain regions activated by an external stimulus or condition is probably the most
common objective in fMRI studies [66]. Neuronal activation in response to a stimulus occurs
in milliseconds and cannot be observed directly. However, neuronal activation is followed
by the metabolic process which increases blood ow and volume in the activated areas, and
can therefore be measured by fMRI. During the course of a task-related fMRI experiment, a
series of brain images are acquired over multiple time points while a subject performs multiple
15tasks, yielding three dimensional tensor responses over time points. The tensor response at
each time point is presumed to be associated with the task related predictors and it is of
scientic interest to delineate the nature and region of activation. Building a regression
framework involving the tensor response and task related predictors is naturally motivated
from such scientic problems. We also refer to applications in electroencephalography (EEG)
studies, where voltage values are measured from numerous electrodes placed on the scalp
over time. The resulting data is a two-dimensional matrix where the readings are both
spatially and temporally correlated. These matrix responses are often regressed on a set
of scalar predictors (e.g., if a subject is alcoholic or not) to identify their variation with
the predictors. Similarly, tensor on tensor regressions have found applications including the
prediction of fMRI from EEG data [12], prediction of gene expression across multiple tissues
from other genomic variables [45] and temporal dynamics of international relational data
[25], to name a few. In what follows, we provide a brief review of Bayesian models for both
vector on tensor and tensor on tensor regressions.
2.1 Bayesian Vector on Tensor Regression Models
[18] formulate the Bayesian vector on tensor regression model, mainly from the motivation
of a single-subject brain activation study, though the framework can be naturally adapted
to other data application contexts. Let Yi= ((Yi;v))p1;::;pD
v1;:::;vD=12
D
d=1Rpddenote a tensor
valued response for the ith sample, where v= (v1;:::;vD)0represents the position of cell vin
theDdimensional array of cells. Let xi= (x1;i;:::;xm;i)02X Rmbe them-dimensional
measured vector predictor. Assuming that both response Yiand predictors xiare centered
around their respective means, the proposed tensor response regression model of Yionxi
is given by
Yi= 1x1;i++ mxm;i+Ei; (8)
fori= 1;:::;n . k2
D
d=1Rpd,k= 1;::;m; is the tensor coecient corresponding to the
predictorxk;i.Ei2
D
d=1Rpdrepresents the error tensor corresponding to the ith sample.
Flexibly modeling the distribution of Eiallows developing the correlation structure between
samples and among the cells of Yi. In the context of single-subject brain activation studies,
16theith tensor response represents the brain image observed at time i. In this specic context,
the error tensor Eiis assumed to follow a component-wise AR(1) structure (see stat03473 )
acrossi,vec(Ei) =vec(Ei 1)+vec(i), where2( 1;1) is the autocorrelation coecient,
andi2 
D
d=1Rpd, with each cell in ifollowingN(0;2=(1 2)). This ensures both
computational simplicity and stationarity in the AR(1) structure.
To tackle the ultra-high dimensional modeling pursuit in estimating the  ks, [18] propose
a rank-R PARAFAC decomposition of each  k, i.e.,  k=PR
r=1(r)

d;k= ((r)
d;k;1;:::;(r)
d;k;p d)0is apddimensional vector, 1 rR, 1dDandk= 1;::;m .
Although the M-DGDP prior constructed on tensor margins in [19] becomes an obvious
choice, [18] observe that a straightforward application of the M-DGDP prior on  kleads
to less accurate uncertainty estimation, perhaps due to less desirable tail behavior of the
posterior distribution of the   v;kparameters. Instead, [18] propose a new multiway stick
breaking shrinkage (M-SB) prior on the tensor coecients  k. The proposed multiway
shrinkage prior bears close connection with the M-DGDP prior, the main dierence being
how it achieves shrinkage across ranks. More specically, set r;k=r;kk, as the scaling
specic to rank r= 1;:::;R . Eective shrinkage across ranks is achieved in [18] by adopting
a stick breaking construction for the rank-specic parameters r;ks,r;k=r;kr 1Q
l=1(1 l;k),
r= 1;:::;R 1, andR;k=R 1Q
l=1(1 l;k), wherer;kiidBeta (1;k). In contrast with the
exchangeable shrinkage oered by the M-DGDP prior across ranks, the M-SB prior imposes
increasing shrinkage across ranks, favoring a low-rank solution. The global scale parameter
is modeled as kIG(a;b). The prior specication is completed by specifying priors
on tensor margins with local scale parameters Wdr;k= diag(wdr;k;1;:::;wdr;k;p d) to achieve

[18] develop theoretical results providing more insights into the model and the proposed
prior. Similar to Section 1.1, the theoretical framework of [18] assumes the number of
predictors as well as dimensions of tensor margins as functions of the sample size n(hence
using a subscript n). [18] derive restrictions on the growth of mnandpd;ns as functions of n
17to ensure asymptotically consistent estimation of  .
Let be amnp1;npD;ntensor whose kth slice is given by  k. Let the true data
generating model be given by (8), with  0as the true tensor coecient. Since the shrinkage
prior on  assigns zero probability at point zero, the exact number of nonzero elements of
 is alwaysmnQD
d=1pd;n. A meaningful comparison with the number of nonzero elements
snof the true tensor coecient  0is made by considering ~ sn, the number of elements of
 exceeding in absolute value a threshold an, which will be specied later. In other words,
only elements with absolute values larger than anwill be treated as signicant and counted
towards non-zero entries.

Importantly, the result proves accurate estimation of  , also ensuring that the true number
of nonzero elements in  0and the number of elements identied as nonzero in  (i.e., above
the threshold an) are of the same order. In fact the L2metric between  and 0is stronger
than the KL-divergence metric used in Section 1.1. Similar to Section 1.1, assumptions on
pd;nandmnallow the number of tensor cells to grow much faster than the sample size n
without disturbing the desirable posterior consistency of the model.
18Building on (8), [54] develop the mixed eect tensor response regression model with
an application to modeling the joint estimation of brain activation at the voxel level and
brain connectivity at the lobe level for multi-subject fMRI studies. Let Yi;g;tbe the tensor
of observed fMRI data in brain region gfor theith subject at the tth time point. Yi;g;tis
observed in the form of a tensor with dimensions p1;gpD;g. To simultaneously measure
activation due to stimulus at voxels in the gth brain region and connectivity among Gbrain
regions, [54] employ an additive mixed eect model with a tensor-valued fMRI response and
activation-related predictors x1;i;t;:::;xm;i;t2R,
Yi;g;t= 1;gx1;i;t++ m;gxm;i;t+di;g+Ei;g;t; (9)
for subject i= 1;:::;n , in region g= 1;:::;G , and time t= 1;:::;T . k;g(k= 1;:::;m )
represents activation due to the kth stimulus at the gth brain region, and hence multiway
stick breaking priors are independently used for each  k;gto determine the nature of ac-
tivation. Additionally, the connectivity between dierent regions is ascertained by jointly
modelingdi;gs with a Gaussian graphical LASSO prior [59] given by,
di= (di;1;::;di;G)0N(0; 1); i= 1;:::;n;
p(j) =C 1Y

whereP+is the class of all symmetric positive denite matrices and Cis a normalization
constant. The covariance = (gg1:gg1) is a vector of upper triangular and diagonal
entries of the precision matrix . Using properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution
(seestat05651,stat05654 ), a small value of gg1stands for weak connectivity between
regionsgandg1, given the other regions. In fact, gg1= 0 (g < g 1) implies that there
is no connectivity between regions gandg1, given the other regions. In practice, a double
exponential prior on the o-diagonal entries will a priori favor shrinkage. An ecient Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed for estimation of model parameters, even in
presence of high resolution fMRI images, and post burn-in MCMC samples are processed to
determine activated voxels in a brain region and connectivity between dierent brain regions.

[54] analyze data collected in a study examining the fMRI scans of individuals undergoing
a test which introduces risk-taking scenarios. This study is known as the Balloon Analog
Risk-Taking Task (BART) Experiment [50], which requires participants to make active de-
cisions, and whose design has been found to correlate with real-world risk behavior such
as alcohol use, cigarette and drug use, gambling, stealing, unsafe sex [36, 35, 37] and trait
measures of risk-taking propensity like sensation seeking, trait impulsivity [36] and trait psy-
chopathy [28]. [54], in particular, employed the model (9) for the joint inference on voxel level
brain activation and connectivity between lobes related to the risk taking task. Figures 6b
shows the estimated map of activated voxels which shows localized activation mainly in the
frontal lobe. This localized pattern of activation in the frontal lobe while performing the
higher-order processing task of risk assessment is consistent with various previous studies [5].
Figure 6a shows estimates for the signicantly nonzero partial correlations between lobes.
This gure also indicates that the frontal lobe plays an important role in this task showing
nonzero partial correlations with the insula, caudate, putamen, and occipital lobes, placing
the frontal lobe at the center of a connective network. This agrees with earlier experiments
suggesting that the frontal lobe plays a role in the assessment of risk [42]. We emphasize that
the Bayesian model shows rapid convergence of the MCMC chain and eciently analyzes
fMRI data with more than 11 ;000 voxels.
202.2 Bayesian Tensor on Tensor Regression Models
In the realm of Bayesian modeling with a tensor response and a tensor predictor, one
of the signicant earlier contributions comes from [25]. Let Yibe a tensor of dimension
p1pDfor sample i= 1;:::;n , with the corresponding predictor Xiof dimension
q1qD. [25] proposes the multilinear regression model given by
Yi=XifC1;:::;CDg+Ei; (11)
whereC1;::;CDare matrices of dimensions q1p1,...,qDpDrespectively, andrefers to
the Tucker product. The error tensors Eiare i.i.d with dimensions q1qD, and are
assumed to follow a tensor normal distribution (see stat02360 ), implying vec(Ei)N(0;)
where is a (QD
d=1qd)(QD
d=1qd) dimensional covariance matrix. Estimating so many
parameters from an unstructured without adding some restrictions on its form appears to
be infeasible. As an alternative, a exible, reduced-parameter covariance model that retains
the tensor structure of the data is the tensor normal model [1, 24], which assumes a separable
(Kronecker structured) covariance matrix. Specically, the tensor normal distribution is
denoted by Np1;:::;pD(0;1;:::;D) which essentially implies =1

 D, where
d2Rqdqd. [25] employs matrix normal priors for Cdjdford= 1;:::;D , and inverse
wishart priors for dto deliver ecient posterior computation. Although the model is the
rst of its kind in developing a Bayesian regression framework between two tensors, it comes
with a restrictive assumption that YiandXiboth have Dmodes. This assumption is
often violated in pertinent neuroscience applications, e.g., in the problem of developing a
regression relationship between fMRI and EEG tensors for subjects. Later on, [41] develop
another framework that relaxes this assumption.
LetYibe the tensor response of dimension p1pD1for sample i= 1;::;n, with
the corresponding tensor predictor Xiof dimension q1qD2. LetYbe a tensor of
dimensionnp1pD1, obtained by stacking the Yi's overi= 1;::;n. A tensorXof
dimensionnq1qD2is created in a similar fashion by stacking the Xis. [41] propose
21a regression framework of XonYas follows
Y=hX;BiL+E; E (v1;:::;vD1+1)N(0;2); (12)

D2= 1, i.e.,Xbecomes a vector, (12) reduces to (8). Reshaping each YiandXito vectors

22jjBjj2, which resembles
a penalized likelihood framework (see stat05934 ). Here ~acts as a tuning parameter,
which is optimized within the Bayesian estimation of the model. Notice that the inferential
framework in [41] is semi-Bayesian since the tuning parameter ~is chosen using a cross-
validation procedure. Further, in contrast with the multiway shrinkage priors discussed
earlier, the prior in [41] imposes a similar degree of shrinkage on every tensor cell. Later,
[6] extend the modeling framework in [41] to develop dynamic tensor on tensor regression
models and use M-DGDP prior as a more eective tool to impose shrinkage on the cells of
22tensor coecients.
IfYtrepresents the response tensor of dimension p1pD1at timet, andXtis the
tensor predictor at time tof dimension q1qD2, the dynamic tensor on tensor regression
model proposed in [6] is given by

whereNp1;::;pD1(0;1;::;D1) represents a D1dimensional tensor normal distribution with

models, such as the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model [65], the VARX and panel
VAR model [8, 9] and the vector error correlation model (VECM) [10, 51], to name a few. In
order to achieve parsimony in estimating tensor coecients, [6] consider a rank-R PARAFAC
decomposition of the tensor coecients, as discussed in earlier sections. The choice of the
prior distribution on the PARAFAC margins is crucial for recovering the sparsity pattern of
the coecient tensor and for the eciency of the inference. To this end, [6] follow the proposal
of the multiway shrinkage prior in [19] (reviewed in Section 1.1) on tensor coecients. As
discussed before, the global-local structure of the M-DGDP prior imposes a careful shrinkage
on cell coecients and oers better scalability properties in high-dimensional settings.
3 Conclusion
Motivated by applications in neuroscience, genomics, social science, chemometrics and
other physical and biological sciences, there has been an increasing interest in the use of
tensor-valued objects within a regression setting. As opposed to summarizing tensors, us-
23ing tensor valued objects within a regression framework reaps important modeling benets.
These advantages include ecient computation, parsimony and importantly, accurate infer-
ence due to accounting for the neighborhood structure in a tensor. As a consequence, this
decade has witnessed rapid developments in statistical methods for tensor regression. In this
review article, we have focused on Bayesian methods related to tensor regression. Although
the literature on tensor regression is predominantly frequentist, Bayesian methods have made
inroads into the literature in the last few years, with some additional benets. Unlike many
of the classical frequentist techniques, Bayesian models allow for exibility, mainly via their
choices of carefully structured prior distributions on tensor valued coecients that provide
data dependent shrinkage of tensor coecients and model-based learning of tuning param-
eters. Additionally, they oer uncertainty in parametric and predictive inferences, and can
be easily implemented via full MCMC techniques. In this review article, we have divided
methods according to the objective of the analysis. First, we have described tensor regression
techniques with a tensor predictor and a scalar response. We have rst reviewed parametric
tensor regression models, and then discussed nonparametric tensor regression models as well.
The article then reviewed tensor regression models with a tensor response and a vector- or
tensor-valued predictor. We mention applications in each case, mainly from neuroscience,
relevant to the methodology reviewed. We also oer a brief discussion on available theoretical
results regarding posterior convergence of these models.
Even though the Bayesian tensor regression methods generally exhibit rapid convergence
in model tting using MCMC, high dimensionality of the tensor data may limit the practical
usage of Bayesian methodology. For example, fMRI experiments produce massive amount of
correlated data over millions of brain voxels, which is dicult to be dealt with using Bayesian
tensor regression. Such a computation issue is not unique to Bayesian methods for tensor
regression, since frequentist tensor regression techniques also employ cross validation steps
to estimate tuning parameters which are computationally costly. As noted before, tensor
regression methods implicitly incorporate spatial information in the data, though combining
tensor regression directly with spatial modeling techniques may draw additional inferential
advantages. EEG or fMRI experiments are examples which produce high resolution spatially
correlated data ready to be mined with Bayesian methodologies. The latter topic is quite
24recent and is certainly an important area of research. In fact, Bayesian methods for big
spatial and structured data still constitute a very active area of research and many more
important contributions are expected. Finally, it needs to be mentioned that although there
are open source codes available on Bayesian tensor regression methods, to the best of our
knowledge, an open source user-friendly software package is still unavailable. More eort in
disseminating codes and software in the public domain for tensor regression methods in the
near future would be greatly benecial.
