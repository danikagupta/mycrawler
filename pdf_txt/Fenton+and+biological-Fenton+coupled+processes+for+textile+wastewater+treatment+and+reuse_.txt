 ABSTRACT 
 Both photo-Fenton oxidation and the combin ation of aerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor 
(SBR) + photo-Fenton oxidation we re investigated in a bench-scale study to degrade 
and reuse, a real textile wa stewater with TOC = 390 mg·L-1, COD = 1560 mg·L-1 O2 
and Escherichia coli  = 80000 CFU·mL-1, for dyeing processes according to RD 
1620/2007 (Spanish Normative for wastewater  reclamation and reuse) and required 
water qualities for internal reuse. The i ndependent variables considered for the 
optimization of the oxidative process were temperature, H 2O2 and Fe (II) 
concentrations. The best results were obtai ned when applying photo- Fenton process as a 
polishing step. In this case,  the previous aerobic biol ogical treatment conducted by 
using a SBR with HRT = 1 day, gave  75 % TOC reduction after 25 cycles. 
Subsequently, the coupled photo-Fenton proce ss applied under optimal conditions ([Fe 
(II) = 66.5 mg·L-1; [H 2O2] = 1518 mg·L-1; T = 25 ºC and pH = 2.7) gave final COD and 
TOC reductions of 97 and 95 % respectively; Escherichia coli  accomplished RD 
1620/2007. However, this treated water could not be 100% used and was further conditioned by reverse osmosis accomplishing suitable water qualities for internal 
reuse. This resultant water was used in dye ing processes and gave similar dyeing results 
in terms of K/S than those obtained by using fresh water.

 1. Introduction 
 
The textile industry is known to be one of  the extremely water and energy intensive 
consuming industries, causing intense polluti on. Indeed, the impact of textile effluents 
on aquatic medium has been tr aditionally of great concer n because they contain high 
concentrations of salts, total suspende d solids, colour, Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD), nutrients and toxic compounds su ch as surfactants, heavy metals, and 
chlorinated organic compounds [1]. In additi on, the release of such coloured effluents 
into the environment is a dramatic sour ce of aesthetic pollu tion, causing important 
perturbation in aquatic life.  
 The physical, chemical and mostly biological technologies have been widely used to 
treat textile effluents. However, most of te xtile effluents are not amenable to common 
chemical or biological treatment s [2, 3]. In this sense, th e increased public concern and 
the stringent international environmental standards (Water Framework Directive 
2000/60/EC) have prompted the need to de velop novel treatment methods for managing 
wastewater and preserving the ecosystem from persistent pollutants release.  
 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are pow erful technologies for the remediation of 
wastewaters containing recalcitrant orga nic pollutants [4]. Although AOPs include 
different reacting systems, their mechanisms are basically characterised by the in situ 
generation of highly reactive and non  selective hydroxyl radicals (HO
·, Eº = 2.8 V 
versus NHE), able to oxidise and minera lise almost all organic compounds to CO 2 and 
inorganic ions. Among available AOPs, the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes are of 
special interest because they offer high reacti on yields with a low treatment cost [5]. In 4 
 dark Fenton reaction (equation (1), H 2O ligands on iron sphere coordination are omitted 
in the successive), hydroxyl radicals are generated by interaction of H 2O2 with ferrous 
salts. Generated Fe (III) can be re duced by reaction with exceeding H 2O2 to form again 
ferrous ion in a catalytic mechan ism (equations (2) and (3)) [6]: 
 
Fe (II) + H2O2 → Fe (III) + HO·  + HO-                                                                          (1)      
Fe (III) + H2O2 → HO· 2 + Fe (II) + H+                                                                           (2) 
Fe (III) + HO· 2  → Fe (II) + O 2 + H+                                                                              (3) 
 
Radiation can play different ro les that lead to an improveme nt of the reaction yields. It 
drives photo-Fenton reacti on by means of ferric aquo co mplexes photolysis, producing 
extra HO· and the recovery of Fe (II) needed  in Fenton reaction (e quation (4), being [Fe 
(III) HO]2+ the dominant ferric species in solution at pH = 2-3) [7]. The irradiated 
process may also involve photolysis of a Fe (III) - H 2O2 complex to form high-valent Fe 
intermediates, which can directly oxidize or ganic matter. Moreover, it can drive ligand 
to metal charge transfer in the potentially photolabile complexes formed by Fe (III) and organic compounds (equation (5)), a proce ss that has been well proven for the 
complexes formed between Fe (III) a nd the carboxylic acid moiety [8].  In photo-Fenton 
system, as in the dark process, iron acts as  a catalyst and the rate-limiting step is the 
regeneration of ferrous ion.

 However, owing to water scarcity and tight er international regulations, an increasing 
development of new water management policie s has appeared in the last years. These 
new policies are in accordance with the guidelines set by the Water Framework 
Directive, which suggest the reuse as a furt her step to water treatment to obtain new 
sources of water. In consequence, an importa nt challenge of textil e industry will be the 
wastewater treatment and reuse to overcome  environmental impact associated to the 
sector [9].  Nowadays, the quality of water for reus e is regulated by guidelines and specific 
regulations [10-12]. According to Span ish RD 1620/2007 (Spanish Normative for 
wastewater reclamation) [12] , different chemical and microbiological parameters need 
to be controlled in order to assess suit able water quality for reuse. Among these 
parameters, we can find Suspended Solids, Turbidity, Legionella  spp and Escherichia 
Coli. Moreover, the specific final use of each reclaimed water (for instance, reclaimed 
water for dyeing processes in our specific case) implies the contro l of some additional 
specific parameters. The contro l of iron content is an impor tant parameter in textile 
industry that should be also considered.   In order to achieve this goal,  we can find different technologi es to treat textile effluents 
in the literature. Most of these technol ogies include the use of membranes, often 
combined with other treatments [13-16].  Th is combination of different processes is 
usually required in order to obt ain an effluent with the requ ired final quality for reuse. 
In this frame, Advanced Oxidation Processes alone or in combination with biological treatments and/or membranes technologies aris e as very promising alternatives for real 
wastewater treatment and reuse. However, so far we can find in the literature few papers 6 
 that include the use of AOPs in order to re use treated water [9, 17-19] and to remove 
microbiological contaminants [20-22].  In the present work, the remediation of a real  textile wastewater fr om Catalonia (North 
East of Spain) was carried out by means of  the following processes: photo-Fenton alone 
and photo-Fenton as a post-treatment of  an aerobic Sequential Batch Reactor  (SBR). 
Moreover, reverse osmosis (RO) was used in  a final stage to achieve suitable water 
qualities in order to be internally  reused in dyeing processes.  
The obtained results showed the feasibility of  the studied processes to achieve suitable 
water qualities according to RD 1620/2007, as well as specific firm requirements for 
internal reuse. Both physicochemical and mi crobiological parameters were considered 
as process effectiveness indicators. Treated wa ter after RO was suitable to be used in a 
100 % for dyeing processes.   
2. Experimental 
 
2.1. Textile wastewater The textile effluent used in this study was collected from a textil e industry located in 
Catalonia (North East of Spain). The effluent  was the output of the existing wastewater 
treatment at the firm, that consists of two homogenization and aeration ponds that 
minimize peak loads on the discharge, redu ce organic matter, and reduce temperature 
from 60 º C to 35 º C. Samples were directly taken from the s econd homogenization pond and stored at 4 º C 
temperature. 7 
 The effluent was characterized in the terms showed in Table 1. As can be seen, it had 
high Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), low-me dium suspended solids and neutral pH, 
as expected from a represen tative textile proce ss. Though, the effluent had no excessive 
coloration because of the high exhaustion de gree of dyes in the considered textile 
process (residual water contained less than  5 % of the concentration of dyes).  
On the other hand, absence of Legionella spp  (CFU·L-1) and a significant level of 
Escherichia coli  (CFU·100 mL-1) was detected due to mixing grey and textile 
wastewater in the homogenization pond. Finally, the Biochemical O xygen demand for 5 days (BOD
5, mg·L-1 O2) to COD ratio 
gives a 0.35 value, which mean a pa rtially biodegradable sample.  
 
2.2. Chemicals 
All chemicals used throughout this study were of the highe st commercially available 
grade. Iron sulphate (FeSO 4·7H 2O, Merck 99.5 %) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, 
Panreac 33 % (w/v)) were used as received. Concentrated sulphuric acid and sodium 
hydroxide solutions were used for pH adjustments. All solutions were prepared with deionised water, prepared using a Millipore Milli-Q 
system.  
2.3. Sample analysis 
Total Organic carbon (TOC, mg·L
-1 C) was determined with a Shimadzu TOC-VCSH 
analyser with a solution of potassium phthalate as standa rd of calibration.  
COD (mg·L-1 O2) was measured using the closed-reflux colorimetric method [23] with 
a HACH DR/2000 spectrophotometer.  8 
 H2O2 consumption was measured according to the vanadate spectrophotometric method 
[24].  Residual H 2O2 was removed with the precise amount of sulphite [25].  Any 
remaining sulphite was removed by bubbling O 2. 
The UV/vis-absorption spectra were reco rded by using a Shimatzu UV-2450 double 
beam spectrophotometer in the 200-700 nm  range and 10-mm light path cells. 
Absorbance at 254 nm was taken as aromatic content in the sample [26].   
Colour index was determined according to [27].  Prior analysis, samples were filtered 
through 0.45 m pore size filter (Scheleicher  & Schuell, FP 30/0.45 CA-S). 
Fe ion was determined according to spectrophotometric phenantroline method [28].  
Turbidity (NTU) was determined with a Lamotte 2008 turbidity meter based on the measure of scattered light at an angle of 90 º, and suspe nded solids parameter (SS, g·L
-
1) was carried out gravimetrically follow ing Standard Methods recommendations [29]. 
 BOD
5 measurement, was performed by mean s of a mercury-free WTW 2000 Oxytop 
thermostated at 20 ºC. When BOD 5 determination took place after photo-Fenton 
treatment stage, due to the toxic character  of hydrogen peroxide, its removal with the 
precise amount of SO 32- [25] was found to be  necessary. 
The Zahn-Wellens  test was carried out under conditions close to those of a conventional 
municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWT P). Fresh activated sludge coming from the 
Manresa WWPT (Catalonia, Spain) was used to prepare the 0.2 g·L-1 of Total 
Suspended Solids (TSS) required in the test specifications [30]. 
The presence of Escherichia coli  was studied using the membrane filtration procedure 
according to UNE-EN ISO 9308-1: 2001 and Legionella spp  was determined according 
to UNE-EN ISO 1173-1:2007.  9 
 Efficiency of dyeing processes was measured  in terms of K/S values calculated by 
Kubelka-Munk equation (K/S = (1-R)2/2R), where R is the decimal fraction of the 
reflectance at max, K is the absorption coefficient and S is the scattering coefficient 
[31].  K/S values were determined with the CM-2500C spectrophotometer with 
horizontal alignment for reflectance and tran smission measurements, from the company 
Konica Minolta.   
 
2.4. Photo-Fenton experimental set-up 
All photo-Fenton experiments were carried out using a cylindrical Pyrex thermostatic  
cell of 2 L capacity. The reaction mixture inside th e cell, consisting of 1.5 L of effluent 
and the precise amount of Fenton’s reagent,  was continuously stir red with a magnetic 
bar to provide good mixing and the temperatur e fixed at the required level. It was 
equipped with a jacket to be cooled or h eated according to e xperimental conditions. 
Four 25 W Philips black light fluorescent la mps, which basically emits at 350-400 nm, 
were used as artificial light source. The intensity of the incident UVA light, measured 
employing a luminometer, was 27.96 W·m-2.  
 
2.5. SBR set-up and operation conditions 
The biological treatment system was compos ed of a 2 L aerobic bench-scale sequencing 
batch reactor (SBR), equipped with an air diffuser and agitation. The operating liquid 
volume was 1.5 L and Hydraulic Retention Ti me (HRT) = 1 day. The fill and draw SBR 
procedure is described elsewhere [32]. Temper ature remained stable and close to room 
conditions. The concentration of  dissolved oxygen (DO, mg·L-1 O2) was kept not lower 
than 3 mg·L-1. Daily analyses of Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS, g·l-1), DO and TOC 
was carried out.  10 
 The pH of solution was adjusted between 6.5 and 7.5. Suitable proportions of essential 
biological nutrients (MgSO 4, CaCl 2, NH 4Cl and NaH 2PO 4 buffer at pH 7) were also 
added to the solution [23].   
2.6. Reverse osmosis (RO) experimental set-up 
The RO treatment system used to perfor m different bench-scale experiments was a 
tangential filtration equipment (SEPA CF II of  GE Osmonics). The membrane used was 
a polyamide membrane (AG of GE Osmonics ) which had 99.5 % of salts rejection. The 
system worked at an equilibrium pressu re of 24.4 bar and flow rate of 340 L·h
-1. 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1. Photo-Fenton treatment In a first stage, photo-Fenton AOP was applied as a stand-alone treatment. 
Taking into account that wast ewater to be treated wa s collected at around 35 ºC 
temperature, and the fact that temperature is an important parameter in the photo-Fenton 
process [33-35], the influence of this parameter was studied. TOC  was followed at four 
different temperatures (25, 30, 35 and 45 ºC ) under optimal photo-Fenton conditions: 
[Fe (II)] = 216 mg·L
-1; [H 2O2] = 4950 mg·L-1 and pH =2.7 [22]. Obtained results are 
shown in Fig. 1. From this Figure, we can say that raising temperature increases the 
speed of the process in the first 40 min r eaction. However, the final degradation level 
was similar in almost temperatures [35] . Contrarily, the degradation process was 
significantly slower at 45 ºC. This is due to a significant loss of  iron by precipitation 
detected at the beginning of the 45 ºC experi ment [36]. From the obtained results, 35 ºC 11 
 was consequently taken as optimal temperat ure. It should be poi nted out that this 
temperature was in accordance with the exit temperature of the raw effluent, and no 
extra energy would be needed in order to raise temperature.  
At this point, the importance of a previ ous filtration by using a filter paper of 0.45 m 
pore size was tested. The presence of susp ended solids could interfere in UV radiation 
in the photo-Fenton process. In this case, TOC  elimination was followed at 35 ºC with 
and without sample filtrati on. Obtained results are shown in Figure 2, in which no 
significant differences exist between the two processes.  Moreover, the pulsed addition of H
2O2 was considered. Fe (II) concentration was 
maintained at 216 mg·L-1 while different pulses of 330 mg·L-1 H2O2 were added every 
30 min. From Figure 3, and comparing with results in Figures 1 and 2, it can be concluded that best results were obtained when Fenton’s reagent was added in a sole 
time. This could be due to the fact that when H
2O2 was added by pulses, the oxidation 
gives place to the fast appearance of shor t chain organic compounds, which are difficult 
to oxidize and can capture Fe (II) [37]. Consequently, Fenton ’s reagent was added in a 
sole time from that point.  The treated textile wastewater was char acterized again under optimum photo-Fenton 
conditions. The obtained results are show n in Table 1. These results show a good 
degradation level of organic matter;  COD  was reduced in a 79 % and TOC in a 75 %,   
Escherichia coli  (Legionella spp  was not present in the original sample) and aromatic 
compounds (UV
254), and also give suitable water quali ty for reuse in accordance with 
RD 1620/2007. However, the internal reuse of th e resultant effluent could not be 100 % 12 
 since the total iron parameter overcomes the limits set by th e firm for their own dyeing 
process (<0.05 mg·L-1 Fe), as well as hardness a nd chloride content (Table 2). 
Therefore, the treated textile wastewater w ould need any dilution with fresh water in 
order to be suitable for reuse.  
3.2. Biological-photo-Fenton coupled processes and reverse osmosis 
Next point was the consideration of the AOP in combination with a biological 
treatment. In general, the AOP can be  used as a pre or post treatment.  
Taking into account that samp les with a ratio of BOD
5/COD ≥ 0.4 are generally 
accepted as biodegradable, while those w ith ratios situated among 0.2 and 0.3 units 
result partially biodegradable ; our effluent with 0.35 BOD 5 to COD ratio value could be 
considered as partially biodegradable. Subsequently, in addition to the BOD
5 to COD estimation, the Zahn-Wellens  test was 
carried out to confirm the inhe rent aerobic biodegradability of  organic substances in the 
textile wastewater.  This test takes place under conditions cl ose to those of a conventional WWTP using 
non-acclimated activated sludge as inoculum. This test was performed in a duplicated 
sample (textile wastewater), a diluted samp le (1:3) and a fully bi odegradable standard 
(aniline) for 28 days, T = 25 ºC and under ae ration. The obtained results are shown in 
Figure 4. We could see a good level of biode gradability in the sample during the 28 
days of the test, achieving TOC reductions  between 69 and 77 %. The biodegradability 
was easier in the diluted sample, achieving th e same successful resu lts. In consequence, 
it could be stated that the biological treatm ent would be the first stage of the treatment 
as the major part of organic ma tter was biologically eliminated. 
 13 
 The biological treatment was simulated using the system SBR described before.  TOC 
evolution was followed during 25 cycles at  HRT = 1 day. A first glucose pulse was 
conducted in order to ensure the correct pe rformance of the biom ass (data not shown). 
As it can be seen in Figure 5; 75 % TO C reduction was achieved.  However, some 
studies [38] have shown that an effl uent could be biode gradable or highly 
biodegradable, but not eliminate some biore calcitrant compounds that would remain in 
the treated water. Conseque ntly, the photo-Fenton process was applied as a biological 
post-treatment in order to eliminate the non bi odegradable part of textile wastewater.  
This resulting solution had a TOC = 114 mg·L-1 C and a COD = 557 mg·L-1O2. Prior to 
the photo-Fenton process, the treated  textile wastewater was filtered through 0.45 m 
pore size filter in order to eliminate solids present in the sample. The pH was also 
adjusted at 2.7 units. The concentrations of Fe (II) and H 2O2 used were according to the 
optimum molar ratio obtained in section 3.1, adapted to the new COD value and to 
assure sufficient H 2O2 concentration in the medium. In consequence, we used a [Fe (II)] 
= 66.5 mg·L-1 and a [H 2O2] = 1518 mg·L-1. The TOC evolution is shown in Figure 6. 
The Figure shows a gradual re duction of the remaining or ganic matter from biological 
treatment, with a final TOC value of 18 mg·L-1 C. This means 95 % TOC reduction in 
the textile wastewater. The effluent was characterized again after the biological + photo-Fenton treatment in 
order to assess the possibility for treated text ile wastewater reuse. In this sense, we 
could say that obtained resu lts in Table 1 show a good de gradation level of organic 
matter, E. coli  and aromatic compounds (UV
254) according to RD 1620/2007. However, 
obtained results in Table 1 must  also be compared with addi tional qualities for internal 
reuse required by the firm (Table 2). Accord ing to this, hardness, chloride and iron 
parameters should be decreased before 100 % of reclaimed water reuse could be 14 
 accomplished. Consequently, a filtration pro cedure by means of RO was applied in a 
last stage [39, 40]. The obtained results are shown in Table 3 while the appearance of 
the sample is shown in Figure 7. From thes e results, we could state that the treated 
textile wastewater was theref ore able to be 100% interna lly reused for dyeing purposes. 
 
3.3. Dyeing experiments 
Once established the best treatment strategies  for the textile wastewater, next goal was 
the use of this reused water in dyeing pro cesses. Two different dyeing processes with 
polyamide (PA) and polyester  (PES) fibres were simula ted according to the firm 
specifications (confidential protocol) by using ac id dyes and disperse dyes, respectively.  
The liquor ratio used was 1/10 (1 g of fibre for 10 mL water).  Three different dyeing strategies  with different types of wate r qualities were studied and 
compared; type A: tap water without calcium (this is the water usually used by the firm, 
which can be considered the standard water) ; type B: reclaimed water obtained after RO 
in a last stage, applied in all dyeing stag es (dyeing, washing, softening…) and type C: 
reclaimed water obtained after RO treatment , applied only in the dyeing process; the 
rest of stages carried out with reclai med water without further RO treatment. 
 Efficiency of dyeing processes was measured in terms of K/S values. These values are 
shown in Figures 8 and 9. The highest K/S va lue, the best dyeing quality is obtained. 
From these Figures, it can be concluded that  K/S difference was less than 2 points (the 
accepted difference by the firm) when dyein g PES and PA fibres with both B and C 
reclaimed waters. Consequently, obtained waters  were suitable to be internally used in 15 
 new PA and PES dyeing processes. The dyeing quality obtained when using B and C 
reclaimed waters was similar that obtained  with conventional tap water (type A).  
 The obtained results were very promising for the firm as well as fo r the textile industry 
in general. Indeed, water reclamation as a further step to  conventional water treatment  
practices offers new sources of water meanwhile  great quantities of fresh water could be 
saved. In our case, the to tal spent of water in this firm was around 87,663 m
3/year, with 
92.4 % consumption in dyeing processes (81.000 m3/year). Obtained results show that 
this huge water quantity could be reused  when combining aerobic treatment, photo-
Fenton and reverse osmosis processes. 
 
 4. Conclusions 
Best water treatment and reuse result s were obtained when combining aerobic 
biological treatment + photo- Fenton + RO processes. 
In the single photo-Fenton process, the optim um photo-Fenton conditions were: [Fe (II) 
= 216 mg·L
-1; [H 2O2] = 4950 mg·L-1; pH =2.7 and T = 35 ºC. Under these conditions, 
results showed a good organic matter degrad ation level (COD was reduced in a 79 % 
and TOC in a 75 %),  Escherichia coli  removal ( Legionella spp  was not present in the 
original sample), aromatic compounds (UV 254) removal, and gave suitable water quality 
for reuse in accordance with RD 1620/2007 and internal firm requirements. However, 
the reuse of effluent could not be 100 % since the total iron parameter overcame the 
limits set by the firm for its specific dyeing process (<0.05 mg·L-1 Fe), in addition to 
chloride and hardness content.  16 
 Highest remediation yields were obtaine d when applying photo-Fenton process as a 
biological polishing step. In this case, the previous aerobic biological treatment 
conducted using a SBR with HRT = 1 day gave 75 % TOC reduction after 25 cycles. Subsequently, the coupled photo-Fenton pr ocess under optimal Fenton conditions ( [Fe 
(II)] = 66.5 mg·L
-1 and a [H 2O2] = 1518 mg·L-1) gave final COD and TOC reductions of 
97 % and 95 %, respectively; Escherichia coli  also accomplished RD 1620/2007. 
Though, Fe content (0.095 mg·L-1) was higher than 0.05 mg·L-1 and chloride and 
hardness content were higher than recommende d by internal limit values. Consequently, 
the obtained effluent could not completely reused and a combination with RO-treated 
water could be necessary.  
 Finally, the use of RO as a polishing final step  gave an effluent that could be directly 
reused in a 100 %, obtaining similar dyeing re sults than those obtained when using fresh 
water. Best results were obt ained when dyeing PA fibre, even improving K/S value with 
respect to tap water qualities. It is re markable that B-dyeing strategy could be 
considered with both PA and PES, avoidi ng filtered water in all dyeing process. 
 In summary, the use of aerobic biological treatment + photo-Fenton + RO is a suitable 
process combination able to treat wastewater textile effluents,  obt aining a final effluent 
that 100% accomplish specific water reuse no rmative as well as additional internal 
requirements for optimum dyeing processes. Contrarily, water wit hout RO final stage 
treatment could not be used in all different processes in the firm.  
 17 
 Moreover, it should be pointed out that, taki ng the studied artifici al light photo-Fenton 
process as starting point, more  favourable results are expect ed when using solar light, 
both in terms of photo-Fenton effectiveness as well as energy consumption.
