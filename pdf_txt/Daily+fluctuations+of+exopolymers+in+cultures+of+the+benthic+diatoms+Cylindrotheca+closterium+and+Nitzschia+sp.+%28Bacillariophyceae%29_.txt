INTRODUCTION
In aquatic environments, extracellular polymeric
substances (EPS) are abundant and are excreted bymany organisms, in particular phytoplankton. Becauseof their sticky nature, these substances are a key factorin the aggregation and sedimentation dynamics ofmarine particles (Engel 2000, Passow 2002) and caninfluence sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms(Thornton 2002). EPS can stick together mineral parti-cles, phytoplankton cells, organic detritus and clay,
thus leading to the formation of large aggregates thatsink rapidly to the sediment in shallow ecosystems orin deep layers of the ocean (Kiorbøe & Hansen 1993,Passow & Alldredge 1995b). High concentrations ofpolysaccharides are usually associated with high phy-toplankton biomass, especially with blooms dominatedby diatoms (Passow & Alldredge 1995b, Mari & Burd1998, Passow et al. 2001). However, diatoms are notthe only source of marine snow formation, even if they

ABSTRACT: Time series of soluble extracellular polymeric substance (S-EPS) and transparentexopolymer particle (TEP) fractions, as well as biological, physical and chemical parameters, werestudied in natural phytoplankton assemblages at 2 macrotidal sites located in the English Channel for3 yr. The first site, the Bay des Veys (BDV), is sheltered from prevailing winds and influenced by ahigh river discharge, whereas the second, Lingreville-sur Mer (LGV), is exposed to the open oceanand to dominant winds. At both sites, the highest TEP concentrations were measured in spring andsummer (1735 and 3604 µg equiv X l
–1at BDV and LGV, respectively) and were correlated with
 phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen concentrations. During the autumn and winter, TEP dynamics
were not related to phytoplankton dynamics but appeared controlled by hydrodynamics. In contrastto TEP concentrations, S-EPS did not present any seasonal dynamics and was not correlated with TEPvariations. The highest amount of S-EPS was recorded in spring at LGV (25.8 mg equiv. glucose l
–1)
and in summer at BDV (26.4 mg equiv. glucose l–1). The S-EPS pool was separated in 2 fractions
according to the molecular weight: low (LW) and high (HW). The LW fraction was produced in higherquantity than the HW fraction, and with larger temporal fluctuations. Therefore, both S-EPS fractionsseem controlled by different environmental parameters depending on the season and on the studiedecosystem. The different dynamics observed for TEP and S-EPS confirm the complexity of carbonexcretion processes in phytoplankton, and the results reveal different metabolic pathways and differ-ent origins for these carbon excretions.

contribute the largest part of it (Thornton 2002).
Indeed many aquatic organisms generate a largeamount of extracellular mucilage, e.g. other microal-gae groups (e.g. dinoflagellates, green algae and coc-colithophorids), macroalgae, bacteria and zoobenthos(Passow 2002).
Besides the aggregation properties of EPS, these
excretions are involved in cell protection (Shimada etal. 1997), cell fixation mechanisms (Welch et al. 1999),nutrient sequestration (Flemming & Wingender 2001)and migration of microphybenthos (Lind et al. 1997).Moreover, EPS secretions represent a significantsource of carbon for microbial, pelagic and benthicconsumers (Decho 1990, Underwood & Smith 1998)including heterotrophic flagellates (Tranvik et al.1993), planktonic tunicates (Flood et al. 1992),euphausiids (Passow & Alldredge 1999) and copepods(Decho & Moriarty 1990). However, EPS may also neg-atively affect grazing of copepods (Prieto et al. 2001,Dutz et al. 2005) and euphasiids (Passow & Alldredge1999). Thus, they play an important role in microbialloops (Decho 1990, Passow 2002).
EPS are predominantly composed by polysaccha-
rides, which are present in the ocean in large quanti-ties and various forms (Hoagland et al. 1993). The pro-duction of EPS is mainly known in the form of stalks,tubes, apical pads, adhering films and cell coastingincluding cells walls and capsules (Hoagland et al.1993). They can be free or strongly attached to cells(Passow 2002). The main part of EPS is represented bythe free fraction, which is constituted of extracellularsoluble carbohydrates (S-EPS) (Underwood et al. 1995,1999, Staats et al. 1999), and by a particulate fraction(Thornton 2002) called transparent exopolymer parti-cles (TEP) (Alldredge et al. 1993). The chemical natureof both fractions is different. S-EPS are mainly madeup of galactose and glucuronic acid (De Brouwer et al.2002), whereas the TEP fraction is mainly composed offucose and rhamnose (Passow 2002). During the pre-sent study, the S-EPS pool was quantified using amethod that measures the neutral polysaccharides(Dubois et al. 1956), whereas the TEP correspond tothe acidic polysachharide fraction (Passow & All-dredge 1995a). S-EPS can be separated in 2 poolsaccording to polysaccharide molecular weight: the lowmolecular weight (LW) pool and the high molecularweight (HW) pool. It has been demonstrated that thecomposition and the production rates of the LW andHW pools in S-EPS vary with environmental condi-tions, such as light intensity, including darkness (Smith& Underwood 2000), and nutrient availability (Staats etal. 1999, Underwood et al. 2004). Several authors havedemonstrated that nutrient limitation also emphasisesTEP production (Staats et al. 2000, Engel et al. 2002,Passow 2002), but it has been shown in many speciesfrom various phyla that large TEP production may also
occur under nutrient-replete conditions (Claquin et al.2008).
The properties and distribution of marine snow in
the ocean was first investigated by Suzuki & Kato(1953). The spatial and temporal distributions of EPSfractions have since been determined in some ecosys-tems. Most of the time these investigations have showna significant correlation between TEP concentrationand phytoplankton dynamics (Hong et al. 1997, Rama-iah & Furuya 2002, Beauvais et al. 2003, Radic et al.2005). Nevertheless, some authors did not find anydirect correlation between the TEP fraction and phyto-plankton biomass (Garcia et al. 2002, Engel 2004).Another study showed that TEP concentrations andphytoplankton biomass were significantly correlatedat the beginning of spring but not during winter (Prietoet al. 2006).
Because EPS play a role in phytoplankton fate by in-
fluencing bloom sedimentation or grazing (Passow &Alldredge 1999, Dutz et al. 2005), the seasonal dynam-ics of EPS have to be studied in coastal areas, particu-larly in aquaculture zones, where phytoplankton re-sources are essential. Our study was performed in oneof the most important shellfish farming productionsarea of Western Europe (Normandie, France). Previousstudies in this area have demonstrated that phyto-plankton assemblages are largely dominated by di-atoms (Jouenne et al. 2005, 2007, Pannard et al. 2008),and that oysters (Crassostrea gigas) feed predominantly
on phytoplankton and, to a lesser extent, on microphy-tobenthos and detritus (Marin Leal et al. 2008). Aggre-gation processes associated with EPS and TEP produc-tion may affect the feeding efficiency and the foodquality for shellfish and zooplankton (Prieto et al. 2001).
In this context, the objectives of the present study
were to describe and compare the seasonal dynamicsof S-EPS and TEP in coastal ecosystems and to investi-gate their controlling factors, in parallel with the phy-toplankton dynamics. In order to reach these objec-tives, we followed the temporal variations of S-EPS andTEP in the eastern (Baie des Veys) and western (Lin-greville-sur-mer) English Channel for 3 yr. Correla-tions between changes in TEP and S-EPS production,phytoplankton dynamics and hydrodynamic factorswere investigated using multivariate analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sites. Samples were collected from 2 large
basins located in the English Channel (Normandie,France) (Fig. 1). Both sites are macrotidal coastalecosystems, with a maximum tidal range of 8 m and amean depth of 6 m. They are both characterised by
14Klein et al.: S-EPS and TEP in coastal ecosystems
dense shellfish farming. These areas contrast in terms
of nutrient availability and hydrodynamics. The east-ern coast of Cotentin (Baie des Veys [BDV]) is pro-tected from prevailing winds because of its location(for details, see Marin Leal et al. 2008) and is largelyinfluenced by river discharge (Jouenne et al. 2005).The western coast (Lingreville-sur-mer [LGV]) isexposed to the westerly winds and is not directly influ-enced by river discharge because of the low inflow ofthe river. The LGV site is more influenced by offshorewater masses than the BDV site.
Sampling was performed 3 times a week for 3 wk in
autumn and spring at each site and monthly betweenboth periods, for 3 yr. Samples were always collectedat high tide, at the same location (49° 24’ 50 N,1° 06’ 50 W for BDV and 48° 56’ 29 N, 1° 35’ 65 W forLGV) and at 1 m depth using a membrane pump. Timebetween sampling and analysis (or filtrations) variedfrom a few minutes (photosynthetic parameters, nutri-ents) to 2 h, with all the analyses performed in trip -
licate.
Physical and chemical measurements. Vertical pro-
files of temperature and salinity were measured with aHYDROLAB DS5 probe. Dissolved nutrients—NO
3,
PO 4and Si(OH) 4—were measured in triplicate using
colorimetric methods, according to Aminot & Kérouel(2007) with a Bran & Luebbe continuous-flow analyser.Dissolved ammonium (NH
4) was measured in triplicate
manually using a colorimetric method (Aminot &Kérouel 2004). Suspended particulate matter (SPM)was obtained after filtration of 1 l of seawater ontoWhatman GF/F pre-combusted filters (400°C) and fur-
ther analyses were performed on a standard weightmeasurement following the method of Aminot &Chaussepied (1983). Meteorological data (solar radia-tion, temperature, rainfall and wind velocity) weremonitored by Météo France 15 km from each samplingsite (Sainte-Marie du Mont for BDV, 49° 24’ 12 N,1° 10’ 06 W, and Gouville-sur-mer for LGV, 49° 06’ 24 N,1° 36’ 24 W).
Chlorophyll a.Phytoplankton biomass was esti-
mated from chlorophyll a(chl a)measurements, both
total and after fractionation, to distinguish the largeand the small fraction by filtration on 10 µm nylon fibreand on Whatman GF/F glass fibre filters at low vacuumpressure. Chl awas extracted from filters by 90% ace-
tone overnight in the dark at 4°C and then measuredby fluorometry (TD-700, Turner Designs) according toWelschmeyer (1994).
Both sampling sites were included in 2 different net-
works, which also measured chl aconcentrations. BDV is
included in the REPHY (IFREMER) network and LGV inthe SMEL HYDRONOR network. We used the chl acon-
centration data from these networks in addition to ourown data.
Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry.
PAM measurements allowed us to estimate the physio-logical status of microalgae (Parkhill et al. 2001). Themaximum energy conversion efficiency, or quantumefficiency of photosystem II (PSII) charge separation(F
v/Fm), was measured using a WATER/B PAM (Walz)
(Schreiber et al. 1986). After a dark adaptation of15 min, a 3 ml subsample was placed in a darkenedmeasuring chamber. The sample was excited by aweak blue light (1 µmol m
–2s–1, 470 nm, 0.6 kHz fre-
quency) and fluorescence was detected at wave-lengths above 695 nm. The blank was performed on fil-tered water from each sample (GF/F filters). F
v/Fmwas
calculated by:
Fv/Fm=  (Fm– F0)/Fm
where F0is the minimum fluorescence and Fmis the
maximum fluorescence (during a saturating lightpulse, 0.6 s, 470 nm, 1700 µmol m
–2s–1) of a dark-
adapted sample (Genty et al. 1989).
Phytoplankton community structure. Phytoplankton
species composition was determined as in Pannard etal. (2008). Briefly, 500 ml of water was filtered on apolycarbonate filter using gentle vacuum. Cells wereresuspended in 2 ml of filtered water and fixed withglutaraldehyde (1% of final volume). Then cells werecounted using light microscopy on Sedgewick-Raftercells.
Determination of TEP. One litre of seawater was fil-
tered in triplicate onto a 0.4 µm polycarbonate filter atgentle vacuum to preserve the phytoplankton cells as15

described by Passow & Alldredge (1995a). The partic-
ular material present on the filter was immediatelyresuspended in 5 ml of filtered (Whatman GF/F) sea-water and centrifuged for 10 min at 3200 ×g. Pellets
were stored frozen at –20°C until analysis. Measure-ments indicated that an average of 3% of the total TEPconcentration (and maximum 5%) could remain on thefilter after resuspension. All TEP data were correctedin order to take in account this average percentageloss.
On the pellets, TEP concentrations were measured
following the method from Claquin et al. (2008), whichavoids high blank values due to absorption of AlcianBlue on polycarbonate filter and the high variability ofthe calibration curves. A volume of 2 ml of 0.02%Alcian Blue prepared in 0.06% acetic acid was addedto a pellet. The sample was centrifuged (3200 ×g,
20 min) immediately to remove the excess dye. Thepellet was rinsed with 1 ml of distilled water and cen-trifuged several times until obtaining an uncolouredsupernatant. A volume of 4 ml of 80% H
2SO 4was then
added to the pellet. After 2 h, the absorption of thesupernatant was measured by spectrophotometer at787 nm. TEP values are expressed as xanthan gumweight equivalent (µg equiv. X l
–1), calculated by
means of a calibration curve realised according toClaquin et al. (2008). A new calibration curve wasrealised at each season using 12 concentrations (intriplicate).
Determination of EPS: soluble carbohydrate frac-
tion. The soluble fraction of EPS is dissolved in seawa-
ter (Underwood et al. 1995). This fraction is obtainedafter filtration onto a 0.4 µm polycarbonate filter. Theseparation of S-EPS in 2 distinct pools (HW and LW)was performed in triplicate according to Underwood etal. (2004) and De Brouwer & Stal (2002). S-EPS wasthen dosed using the colorimetric method of Dubois etal. (1956). A volume of 8 ml of the filtrate was added tocentrifuge tube containing 24 ml cold ethanol (75%)and the S-EPS was allowed to precipitate overnight at–20°C. After centrifugation at 3200 ×gfor 15 min,
supernatant representing S-EPS LW and pellets repre-senting S-EPS HW were separated and placed in incu-bator at 50°C for drying. Dried samples were resus-pended in x ml of distilled water for HW and LW,
respectively. A volume of xml of phenol (5%) and 5 x
ml of H
2SO 4was added and, after 30 min, the EPS con-
centrations were measured at 485 nm by spectropho-tometer (x= 3 for HW and x= 5 for LW). S-EPS values
are expressed as glucose (mg equiv. glucose l
–1). EPS
values are expressed per chl aunit (mg equiv. glucose
mg–1chl a).
Numerical analyses. In order to draw a parallel
between the environmental and biological parametersand the species composition (see Table 1), canonicalcorrespondence analyses (CCA) were performed for
each site and for each season using the programCANOCO 4.5 (ter Braak & Verdonschot 1995). Speciesdata were ln-transformed [ln(x + 1)] as these variablesmay have an asymmetric distribution due to exponen-tial growth when conditions are favourable (ter Braak& Smilauer 2002). CCA is an efficient ordination tech-nique when a Gaussian relationship between speciesand the environmental gradients is expected (ter Braak1986). This constrained analysis extracts the best envi-ronmental gradients that explain a maximum of thevariability of species data. Biological variables (such asS-EPS and TEP concentration) were added as supple-mentary variables to the CCA, and were thus corre-lated with the canonical axis (which is a linear combi-nation of environmental parameters) on the plot.
RESULTS
Nutrients, chl a, TEP and S-EPS
Nutrient concentrations determined during the study
showed classic trends of temperate nutrient-richcoastal ecosystems (Jouenne et al. 2005, Pannard et al.2008). Each year, winter nitrate concentrations were~30 µM at both BDV and LGV. Nitrates decreasedthroughout the spring and reached concentrations atthe detection limit during summer (<0.01 µM) (data notshown). Changes in silicate concentrations showed the16

same trend as the concentrations of nitrate, charac-
terised by high values in winter and low values in sum-mer (data not shown). Phosphate concentrationsremained low throughout the 3 yr studied and in -
creased slightly during the winter at both sites (datanot shown). Ammonium concentrations remained lowduring the winter and spring and increased from sum-mer to autumn for the 3 yr studied at BDV (data notshown). At LGV, ammonium concentrations werehighest during the spring (up to 3.2 µM) and remainedlow during the summer with a slight increase duringfall.
The total chl adata are presented for each site in
Fig. 2 and Table 2. Concentrations ranged from 0.7 to8.1 µg l
–1at LGV and from 0.6 to 18.9 µg l–1at BDV.
The highest values at both sites were observed inspring 2008. Chl aconcentrations observed at both
sites during sampling periods were in accordancewith annual data from the REPHY IFREMER andHYDRONOR SMEL networks (Fig. 2). At BDV, chl a
showed higher concentrations in spring than inautumn, except in 2007 when higher chl aconcentra-
tions were observed in autumn. At LGV, the spring andthe autumnal chl aconcentration variations were
roughly the same except for spring 2008, whichshowed a large increase Annual chl aconcentrations
were lower at LGV than at BDV, 2.95 and 4.3 µg l
–1,
respectively (Table 2). The annual chl aconcentrations
at LGV were two-thirds of those at BDV, indicatingthat environmental conditions were more favourable tobloom development at BDV than at LGV. At both sites,large cells dominated phytoplankton communitiesover the 3 yr (62.3% at BDV and 57.0% at LGV) andfollowed the same evolution as the total biomass (r
2=
0.94, p < 0.0001 at BDV and r2= 0.92, p < 0.0001 at
LGV) (data not shown).
TEP concentrations were measured during the
whole sampling period at each site (Fig. 3, Table 2).TEP abundance is expressed in µg equiv. X l
–1and as a
function of chl a(TEP/chl ain µg equiv. X µg–1chl a),
as is frequently observed in the literature. TEP abun-dance varied largely at both sites: from 36.9 to 1735 µgequiv. X l
–1at BDV with a mean of 280.7 µg equiv. X l–1
and from 26.4 to 3604.5 µg equiv. X l–1at LGV with a
mean of 452.4 µg equiv. X l–1. Generally, during high
TEP concentration periods, the highest values weremeasured in LGV; nevertheless, overall TEP concen-trations at both sites were not significantly different(t-test, p = 0.0584). At BDV, the highest TEP concentra-
tions were recorded during spring 2006, after whichconcentrations were smaller and increased in springand autumn. At LGV, the observed concentrationswere quite variable with a tendency to increase inspring. The highest peak was observed at the begin-ning of 2008, followed by a sudden decrease. Theobserved pattern changes when the production of TEP
is expressed per unit chl a. At BDV, the TEP/chl aratios
were relatively low (from 9.4 to 677 µg equiv. X µg
–1
chl a)with a mean value of 83.7 µg equiv. X µg–1chl a.
In contrast, at LGV the TEP/chl aratios were higher
(from 8.8 to 1239 µg equiv. X µg–1chl a)with a mean of
186 µg equiv. X µg–1chl a. The highest values
appeared from December 2007 to March 2008.
The temporal evolution of S-EPS (LW and HW) dur-
ing sampling is presented for both sites in Fig. 4 andTable 2. The variation of both EPS pools did not showany specific pattern at either site. The highest amountof EPS was produced in May 2007 at LGV (25.8 mgequiv. glucose l
–1) and in July 2007 at BDV (26.4 mg
equiv. glucose l–1). Specifically, the LW pool was
always higher in concentration than the HW pool atboth sites. Concentrations of LW at BDV ranged from5.5 to 25.1 mg equiv. glucose l
–1and from 0.6 to17

21.9 mg equiv. glucose l–1at LGV, whereas concentra-
tions of HW ranged from 0.7 to 3.9 mg equiv. glucosel
–1at BDV and from 0.4 to 6.3 mg equiv. glucose l–1at
LGV. The mean concentrations of HW and LW werealmost the same at both sites: 2.01 and 12.19 mg equiv.glucose l
–1for HW and LW, respectively, at LGV, and
1.52 and 12.45 mg equiv. glucose l–1for HW and LW,
respectively, at BDV. More generally, the LW fractionincreased largely during spring or early summer andincreased slightly during autumn. Although the HWfractions decreased over the 3 yr sampling, no seasonaltrend was observed.
Seasonal dynamics
CCA and correlations were used to relate the TEP
and S-EPS (LW and HW) concentrations to environ-mental variables and species occurrences.
Spring and summer
The CCA performed on spring and summer LGV
data was significant (Monte-Carlo test, p < 0.002)(Fig. 5). The first 2 axis of the CCA together explained73.3% of the total variance of the species–environ-ment relationship. Ammonia concentrations and lightintensity contributed strongly to the first axis (89.3 and–70.9%, respectively) and F
v/Fmvalues were also
linked to the first axis (36.9%). This relationship meansthat when the ammonia concentrations were high, thephysiological status of cells was good. The CCAshowed that LW fractions were high when F
v/Fm(i.e.
the apparent physiological status of cells) and theammonia concentrations were low and when the lightintensity was high. The chl aconcentrations of large
cells were strongly associated with the second axis ofthe CCA (62.6%), as were nitrate concentrations(49%). Therefore, the bloom of large cells occurredwhen nitrate concentrations were high. TEP produc-tion was also associated with the second axis (50.1%).Furthermore, TEP concentrations and biomass of largecells were well correlated during this season (r
2= 0.56,
p = 0.002), indicating that large cells were predomi-nantly responsible for the phytoplanktonic origin ofTEP. TEP concentrations were also correlated withnitrate concentrations (r
2= 0.75, p < 0.0001). The high
TEP values were related to the dominance of Rhab-
donema sp., Guinardia spp. and Ditylum sp. The CCA
demonstrated that TEP and S-EPS (mainly LW) con-centrations had different dynamics, these parametersbeing indeed almost perpendicular on the CCA. More-over, both soluble pools (LW and HW) followed differ-ent patterns: HW fractions were high when the TEP,chl aand nitrate concentrations were low.
The CCA performed on spring and summer BDV
data was significant (Monte-Carlo test, p < 0.002). Thefirst 2 axes of the CCA together explained 64% of thetotal variance of the species–environment relationship.The ordination diagram of species, environmentalparameters, and sampling dates is presented in Fig. 6.TEP dynamics followed to a lesser extent the chl acon-
centrations of large cells, which is confirmed by an r
2-
value of 0.48 (p < 0.001). The CCA demonstrated thatTEP concentrations were significantly inversely linked18

to silicate concentrations. In this area, during the
spring season, the correlation coefficient between TEPand HW (r
2= 0.46, p < 0.006) indicated close relation-
ships between these 2 variables, which is also high-lighted by CCA. TEP and HW productions must, there-fore, be controlled by the same factors. As for LGV,CCA showed that TEP concentrations were correlatedwith dissolved nitrogen concentrations, in this casewith ammonia (r
2= 0.45, p < 0.001) instead of nitrates.
Moreover, HW concentrations were also correlatedwith ammonia concentrations (r
2= 0.8, p < 0.0001). It is
worth noting that these high concentrations of TEP andS-EPS (HW) were associated with 3 diatom species:Rhizosolenia imbricata ,Guinardia spp. and Asterionel-
lopsis glacialis . During spring and summer at both
sites, TEP production was correlated with phytoplank-ton biomass, as shown by both CCA and correlations,and was controlled by nitrogen (nitrates or ammonia,depending on site) availability. However, S-EPS didnot present the same dynamics for both sites. These S-
EPS pools (LW and HW) evolved differently at LGVand at BDV and were controlled by different factorswithin the same site. At LGV, the CCA distinguishedthe 3 yr (Fig. 5), in contrast to the CCA at BDV (Fig. 6)indicating a higher interannual variability of environ-mental and biological parameters at LGV than at BDV.
Autumn and winter
At both sites, the TEP and HW dynamics during au-
tumn and winter could be distinguished from the springand summer dynamics (Figs. 3 & 4). At LGV, as forspring and summer, the 2 first axes of the CCA, ex-plaining 82.6% of the total variance (Monte-Carlo test,p < 0.002), showed that periods characterised by chl a
concentrations of large cells were associated with highnitrate concentrations, which contributed to the firstaxis (39.4%; Fig. 7). HW concentrations increased withnitrates (r
2= 0.40, p < 0.05) and with biomass of large
cells (r2= 0.74, p < 0.0001). TEP production originated
from large cells in spring, whereas HW production orig-inated from those cells in autumn. In contrast to spring19

and summer, however, TEP concentrations were not
correlated with phytoplankton biomass (i.e. chl a con-
centrations, or total or large chl a)or nitrate concentra-
tions, but with silicate and ammonia concentrations(r
2= 0.54, p < 0.006, and r2= 0.52, p < 0.01, respectively)
and with SPM (r2= 0.60, p < 0.002). These 3 parameters
were the main factors that contributed to the secondaxis (61.7, 85.6 and 48.13%, respectively). This site isparticularly exposed to westerly winds during both au-tumn and winter and its geographical situation leads tohigh and frequent resuspension. The effect of nutrientavailability on excretion production (TEP and HW) dif-fered between spring and autumn, with TEP concentra-tions in autumn related to silicate and ammonia con-centrations and HW concentrations related to nitrateconcentrations. This CCA showed that HW and TEPconcentrations were inversely correlated (r
2= 0.41, p <0.04). HW was produced mainly when Thalassionemanitzschioides and Paralia marina development oc-
curred, whereas TEP was produced when Fragilariasp., Guinardia spp. and Odontella spp. were blooming.
In autumn and winter, chl a concentrations and
excretion production at BDV were not controlled bythe same factors as in spring and summer. The CCAperformed was significant (Monte-Carlo test, p < 0.01)and the first 2 axes of the CCA together explained63.9% of the total variance (Fig. 8). The CCA indicatedthat nitrogen concentrations as ammonia and nitrateforms contributed largely to the first axis (57.4 and52.9%, respectively) and that LW fractions were pro-duced when nitrogen concentrations were high. TheCCA showed that high TEP concentrations were pro-duced with the occurrence of Thalassiosira rotula,Asterionellopsis glacialis and Paralia marina and that–1.0 1.51.0

this production was controlled by wind speed and the
temperature of water column. These 2 parameters con-tributed strongly to the second axis (42.6 and –47.8%,respectively). S-EPS and TEP concentrations againshowed contrasting patterns.
As for the spring and summer seasons, the CCA
highlighted an influence of nitrogen (i.e. ammonia)availability on TEP production at LGV. However, dur-ing autumn and winter at both sites, TEP productionwas also controlled by hydrodynamics and, particu-larly, the wind, which induced resuspension (high SPMconcentrations) and entailed variations in nutrientavailability. As for spring and summer, the LW and HWS-EPS fractions did not present the same dynamics atboth sites and they were controlled by different factorswithin the same site. LGV also showed higher interan-nual variability of environmental and biological para-meters during these seasons than BDV. Indeed, at LGVthe CCA again distinguished the 3 yr (Fig. 7), contraryto the CCA at BDV (Fig. 8).DISCUSSION
Local processes and mixing of water masses
Coastal ecosystems are characterised by strong
physical and chemical forcings. These systems are theboundary between the open ocean and the continen-tal zones and are characterised by mixing processeswith surrounding water masses. Consequently, thewater column structure is frequently modified andinfluences phytoplankton dynamics, which is con-trolled by abiotic parameters (Margalef et al. 1979,Gentilhomme & Lizon 1998, Smayda & Reynolds 2001,Pannard et al. 2008). Both studied areas differed inthe hydrodynamic forces that they are exposed to.The local topo graphy of BDV provides shelter from
prevailing wind whereas LGV is exposed to the openocean and dominant winds and presented manygyres, indicating a regular mixing of the water col-umn (Ménesguen & Gohin 2006).21

As previously described in this area (Jouenne et al.
2007, Pannard et al. 2008), the spring bloom began inMarch at LGV and later (April/May) at BDV. Theautumnal bloom appeared in September at BDV and inOctober at LGV. At both sites, the phytoplankton com-munities were largely dominated by diatoms, as previ-ously reported (Jouenne et al. 2007, Pannard et al.2008). For all seasons, the dominant species and thecommunity structure of the phytoplankton were differ-ent between both sites (data not shown), in accordancewith the nutrient availability and the hydrodynamicsregime.
Seasonal variability of TEP and S-EPS
Phytoplankton is known as a major source of excre-
tion of polysaccharides (Passow & Alldredge 1994,Mari & Burd 1998, Ramaiah et al. 2001). TEP concen-trations varied greatly at both sites (36.9–1735 µg l
–1at
BDV and 26.4–3604.5 µg l–1at LGV) during the 3 yr of
sampling. The minimum values observed at each sitewere 10 to 20 times lower than those previouslyobserved in the Pacific (<500 µg l
–1; Passow & All-
dredge 1995b, Li et al. 1998, Passow et al. 2001) and inthe northwest Atlantic Ocean (<124 µg l
–1; Engel
2004), and the maximum values were similar to thosemeasured in the Ross Sea (2800 µg l
–1; Hong et al.
1997). Values observed at each site remained largelylower than those measured in the Northern Adriatic(maximal values were 14 000 µg l
–1; Radic et al. 2005)
or in the Baltic Sea (Engel & Passow 2001). Further-more, it has been demonstrated that coastal zones pre-sent high TEP concentrations (100–3000 µg l
—1; Pas-
sow 2002). The coastal ecosystems are often directlyinfluenced by river nutrients inputs. Nutrient increaseslead to higher phytoplankton biomass, resulting inhigh TEP concentrations (Corzo et al. 2000). TEP/chl a22

between physical, chemical and biological variables (arrows), species abundance ( n) and date of sampling ( s). Biological 
variables are as in Fig. 5Klein et al.: S-EPS and TEP in coastal ecosystems
ratios are usually low during phytoplankton blooms,
and increase at the end of the bloom when cellsbecome senescent. TEP/chl aratios ob tained during
the present study are in accordance with those fromprevious studies (Prieto et al. 2006, Ortega-Retuerta etal. 2009).
During the spring and summer, TEP concentrations
followed the chl aconcentrations at both sites, which
implies a consistent production of TEP by active grow-ing phytoplankton. This positive correlation betweenboth variables has already been observed in many sys-tems (Passow & Alldredge 1995b, Hong et al. 1997,Ramaiah & Furuya 2002, Beauvais et al. 2003, Radic etal. 2005, Prieto et al. 2006). In the present study, thehigh TEP concentrations resulted from a high numberof phytoplankton cells. Further, TEP concentrations atboth sites were also correlated with nitrogen concen-trations. At LGV, TEP concentrations showed closerelationships with nitrate concentrations; at BDV, TEPconcentrations were closely correlated with ammonia
concentrations. It seems that high nitrogen concentra-tions enhanced phytoplankton growth and led to anincrease in TEP concentrations. Furthermore, becauseriver discharge was significantly higher at BDV than atLGV, nutrient inputs enhanced phytoplankton growthto a greater extent at BDV than at LGV. This resultexplains why we observed a negative and significantcorrelation between TEP and silicate concentrationsduring spring and summer at BDV. Indeed, the diatombloom consumed the stock of silicates, while theincrease in phytoplankton cell numbers led to anincrease in TEP production.
During the autumn and winter, at each site, TEP con-
centrations did not follow the phytoplankton dynamics.The absence of a positive correlation between TEP andchl aconcentrations has been already found in some
coastal ecosystems (Schuster and Herndl, 1995, Garciaet al. 2002). This trend indicates that the phytoplank-23

ton community did not produce a significant amount of
TEP or that TEP was rapidly exported, consumedand/or degraded. Indeed, the amount of TEP dependsnot only on phytoplankton excretion abundance, butalso on the degradation, grazing and turbulence levels(Mari & Burd 1998, Penna et al. 1999, Kiorbøe 2000,Garcia et al. 2002). Mari & Burd (1998) used a model topredict TEP concentrations and demonstrated thatbacterial degradation and grazing rate are essential topredict the real TEP concentrations in situ . It is well
known that bacteria use a considerable fraction of phy-toplankton production as a carbon source (Passow etal. 2001, Colombo et al. 2004, Pacobahyba et al. 2004).Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that zooplank-ton, as grazers, are associated with marine snow in theeuphotic zone (Kiorbøe 2000). However, the relation-ships between TEP dynamics and these 2 processes(degradation and grazing) are still being discussed.Indeed, a previous study has shown a positive correla-tion between bacteria and TEP concentrations, exclud-ing the degradation of TEP by bacteria (Passow et al.2001). Other works demonstrated that planktoniccopepods did not use TEP as an energy source (Prietoet al. 2001) and that copepod feeding was inhibited byTEP presence (Dutz et al. 2005). Turbulence may alsoexplain the difference observed between phytoplank-ton and TEP dynamics in autumn/winter. Turbulencelevel acts on aggregation dynamics and may affect dif-ferently the residence time of TEP and phytoplanktonin the water column (Garcia et al. 2002). This couldexplain the uncoupling that we observed betweenthese 2 components during this period. Interpretationsof field measurements at LGV and BDV during autumnand winter could be explained by the turbulence level.At both sites, we showed that physical forcing had animpact on TEP production during autumn and winter.Consequently, we can consider that turbulence levelexplains the autumn and winter dynamics of TEP,through resuspension of exopolysaccharide-rich parti-cles as microphytobenthos biofilm.
The results of the present study also show that TEP
was produced by different phytoplankton speciesdepending on season and site. It is known that exo -
polysaccharides released by microorganisms dependon species, individual physiological state and environ-mental parameters such as light, carbon dioxide con-centrations, nutrient availability, temperature and tur-bulence regime (Passow 2002, Claquin et al. 2008).Nevertheless, the EPS production varies according tothe diatom species; 3 species, Nitzschia sp., Skele-
tonema marinoi and Thalassiosira spp., observed dur-
ing the periods of high TEP concentration at both siteshave already been described in association with highTEP concentrations in field or laboratory studies(Logan et al. 1995, Prieto et al. 2002, Urbani et al. 2005,Claquin et al. 2008). However, there is a severe lack of
studies on TEP production and on TEP regulation as afunction of the phytoplankton species present. Thisknowledge is essential to understand the dynamics ofTEP concentrations in the field.
In contrast to TEP concentrations, the S-EPS pools
were not correlated with chl aconcentrations, which
suggests that a portion of the S-EPS excretions was notrelated to phytoplankton. These excretions can be pro-duced by bacteria, macro- and micro-phytobenthos,zooplankton and zoobenthos. Because a large part ofS-EPS (HW and LW) was due to non-phytoplanktonicexcretions, the influence of phytoplankton on thedynamics of S-EPS cannot be well described. TEPdynamics appeared largely driven by phytoplanktondevelopment in spring and summer. The TEP pool thatwe measured was also a good indicator of phytoplank-ton carbon excretion, which was not the case forS-EPS.
The S-EPS fraction produced by benthic diatoms has
been largely described in the literature (Decho 1990,Wolfstein & Stal 2002, Underwood et al. 2004). How-ever, S-EPS production by planktonic diatoms hasbeen rarely studied. High concentrations of solublecarbohydrates could be present on mudflats, between50 and 5000 µg g
–1sediment (Underwood & Smith
1998). Several authors have studied the mechanism ofEPS production in benthic diatoms as a function ofnutrient, light and temperature (Smith & Underwood2000, De Brouwer & Stal 2002, Wolfstein & Stal 2002,Underwood et al. 2004). It has been demonstrated thatthe S-EPS production increased in nutrient-limited cul-tures and that this production can occur under bothdark and illuminated conditions (Smith & Underwood2000, De Brouwer & Stal 2002, Wolfstein & Stal 2002).The chemical composition and physical characteristicsof S-EPS changed also significantly with environmen-tal conditions and the physiological status of thediatom cells (De Brouwer & Stal 2002, Underwood etal. 2004). In the present study, the wind-exposed site(LGV) always showed higher S-EPS concentrationsthan the protected area (BDV). The concentrations ofthe HW pool were only correlated with TEP concentra-tions in the BDV during the spring and summer sea-sons. For the rest of the sampling, TEP and S-EPS con-centrations were not linked. A different pattern of LWand HW S-EPS pools was also observed. This resultcan be explained by the work of Underwood et al.(2004). They showed that, in the benthic diatom Cylin-
drotheca closterium , the production of LW and HW S-
EPS followed different metabolic pathways and weredifferently affected by environmental factors. In thepresent study, the S-EPS fraction showed differentdynamics depending on the site and the season. Nospecific pattern was found. In the present study, we24Klein et al.: S-EPS and TEP in coastal ecosystems
showed that the S-EPS stocks often do not depend on
chl aconcentrations; instead, other organisms or bio-
chemical cycles largely influenced the dynamics of thiscomponent at both sites.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that the dynamics of TEP
and S-EPS were different at the 2 studied sites and var-ied as a function of seasons, although these 2 poolsmay have the same precursors. However, it appearedthat TEP production was largely related to phytoplank-ton and nutrient dynamics in spring and summer,whereas hydrodynamic forcings drove TEP concentra-tion variations in autumn and winter. In contrast to theTEP dynamics, which was partly explained by ourresults, the causes of the variation in the S-EPS poolcould not be clearly elucidated. Our results show thatthe origins of TEP and S-EPS are different, indicatingdifferent production patterns. We pointed out that it isnecessary to study, in the laboratory, EPS production inplanktonic species because previous studies havedealt mainly with benthic diatoms. Besides aiding theunderstanding of TEP and S-EPS dynamics in coastalecosystems, the results of the present study will beused in future to estimate the portion of primary pro-duction that fuels the phytoplankton-extracellular car-bon pool.
