abstract
Phycoremediation has been successfully used in reducing nutrient levels in wastewater treatment. 
However, studies on the efficiency of phycoremediation to reduce the nutrient levels in eutrophic 
lakes are limited. This review focuses on the mechanism and factors involved in employing algae 
to remove nutrients and pollutants from wastewater before discussing the potential of algal-based techniques in remediating lake eutrophication. Techniques used in phycoremediation of waste-
water include algal biofilm, algal turf scrubbers, high-rate algal ponds (HRAP) and immobilized 
algae. Harvesting mechanisms, factors influencing the phycoremediation and strain selection in 
phycoremediation of eutrophic lakes were also considered. The review concludes with the challenges 
facing the application of the techniques.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, lakes have been threatened by 
pollution due to anthropogenic activities. Pollution from 
domestic, industrial and agricultural activities have led to a deterioration of lake water quality. One of the major prob-lems regarding lake water quality is eutrophication. Lake eutrophication has been identified as a prevalent challenge worldwide that required prompt action for intervention [1,2]. Lake eutrophication induced by excessive nutrient inputs, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), not only promotes excessive algal growth but also threatens the ecological quality of lakes by altering the food web, water quality, and aquatic chemistry [3]. Lake eutrophication can lead to massive growth in toxic dinoflagellates or blue-green algae, causing oxygen depletion and fish kills or produc-ing neurotoxins harmful to humans [4]. Phycoremediation, a technique that uses microalgae or macroalgae to remove or reduce pollutants including nutrients [5], was considered as one of the effective ways to deal with water pollution due to its high efficiency and low-cost usage [5,6]. The use of algae for bioremediation has gained acceptance since its introduction in the 1950s by Oswald et al. [7], who used microalgae for the tertiary treatment of municipal waste-water. The remediation of lake pollution and eutrophication by manipulating algal growth is a potential technique with prospects in tropical climate regions because they receive constant solar input, higher temperatures and high rain intensities which favor algal bloom growth conditions [8].
Phycoremediation technology has been employed in 
wastewater treatment in many industries [9]. For example, in the electroplating industry, the application of Desmococcus olivaceus to treat chrome sludge in an open pond [10] resulted in a reduction of ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate. Sivasubramanian et al. [11] showed how Chlorococcum  sp., 
Chlorella conglomerate, and Desmococcus  sp. were able to 
remove nitrate and phosphate very rapidly from effluent pro-duced by the soft drinks industry. Leptolyngbya sp. was able 165 S.B. Abd. Razak, Z. Sharip / Desalination and Water Treatment 180 (2020) 164–173
to remove about 60% of total nitrogen in dairy waste water 
[12]. Kshirsagar [13] showed that Chlorella vulgaris had a 
high nitrate removal capacity, while Scenedesmus quadricauda  
showed the best result for phosphate reduction in waste-water. In Hanumantha et al. [14], phycoremediation using Chlorella vulgaris in the field gave better results in nutrient 
removal compared to laboratory conditions. Additionally, C. 
vulgaris showed high phosphorus removal (>98%) in urban 
[15] and effluent wastewater [16]. Botryococcus  sp., Chlorella 
sp., Scenedesmus sp., Phormidium  sp. and Spirulina  sp. are the 
most widely used algae for the phycoremediation of waste-
water [15,17–23]. Despite its wide application in treating 
wastewater, information on the use and efficiency of phy-
coremediation to reduce the nutrient level in lakes is still 
limited. This work attempts to review the general application of phycoremediation in various studies and systems before 
looking into its potential in remediating lake water. The 
review also addresses mechanisms and factors influencing 
phycoremediation.
2. Physiology and nutrients removal mechanisms of algae
Algal productivity is controlled by the physicochemical 
factors and biological features directly and indirectly affect-
ing photosynthesis, such as light intensity, mixing rate and temperature, absorption of light, and exposure duration [24]. Among the important factors in selecting algal species are their ability to resist various physiological stresses, such as fluctuating nutrients, organic loading, and extreme tempera-tures [25], and their potential for scavenging numerous types of pollutants [24].
Eutrophic lake is commonly dominated by Cyanobacteria  
such as Microcystis, Planktothrix, Limnothrix, Anabaena, or 
Aphanizomenon [26]. Several of their prokaryotic properties such as gas-vesicles, low CO
2, high pH optimum and nitro-
gen-fixation bear special ecological significance [26]. Blue-green algae can assimilate many nitrogen forms such as nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and N
2 and can grow with nitrate 
as the only nitrogen source [27]. The mechanism of N2 fixa-
tion in blue-green algae had many similarities to that found in some free-living bacteria and in nodules of leguminous crops, where the enzymes involved in fixation of molecu-lar nitrogen are located on the lamellae [27]. However, the expression of certain characteristics is dependent on the form and the size of the Cyanobacteria.
For instance, the formation of colonies or aggregates is 
important for the physiology and behavior of Cyanobacteria. The colonies formed may help the Cyanobacteria to thrive in mixed conditions, due to their ability to fix nitrogen. Moreover, it can stratify as solitary filaments. Some Cyanobacteria, such as Microcystis and Planktothrix bear gas-vesicle and are able to use water column stability as a resource [28]. They can rise to the water surface where light and carbon diox-ide are available or accumulate at some intermediate depth where conditions favor them. Other Cyanobacteria, such as Limnothrix or Aphanizomenon, are more dependent on higher turbulence [26]. Most Cyanobacteria have high resistance to 
zooplankton grazing that limits herbivory impact on them besides having a high tolerance to a wide range of ecolog-ical conditions including achieving optimum growth at high temperatures and eutrophic waters [29]. In contrast to Cyanobacteria, different green algae species vary in their eco-logical preferences including the degree of water movement, nutrient levels, pH, hardness and salinity [29].
Spirulina is one of the Cyanobacteria species that demon-
strate better resistance to physiological stresses, and its use 
in nutrient removal has been extensively studied by Olguin 
et al. [17,30–32]. Spirulina has the ability to auto-flocculate, making them easier and cheaper to harvest, as well as dis-
playing high tolerance to ammonia-nitrogen. A successful 
Spirulina culture under tropical conditions, with tempera-
tures in the range of 29°C–34°C and sunlight intensity rang-
ing from 476–1,784 µmol photon m
–2 s–1, was reported by 
Olguin et al. [30].
Microalgae are also capable of tolerating harsh or heavily 
polluted environments as they have the ability to eliminate other contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic pol-lutants [33] through biosorption and bioconcentration [34]. Heavy metal adsorption by microalgae is associated with the presence of high-affinity metal bindings on the algal sur -
faces, while accumulation is associated with metal uptake by the live cells [34]. Removal of heavy metal by biosorp-tion found to be higher among dead cells compared to live cells [34], which was attributed to the larger surface, volume ratio and higher metal binding attraction. Chojnacka et al. [35] showed that blue-green algae Spirulina has the maxi-mum biosorption capacity of Cr, Cd, and Cu. The authors also showed that microalgae biosorption capacity improved with high light intensity.
In addition, microalgae offer great potential for the biore-
mediation of organic pollutants such as pesticides, pheno-lics, tributyltin, naphthalene, bisphenol and hydrocarbon [34]. Photosynthesis by microalgae plays a major role in pol-lutant degradation. The growth and ability of microalgae to degrade organic pollutants in wastewater treatment could be enhanced by the addition of glucose nutrients [36], while biosorption and biodegradation are the mechanisms used to remove compounds [37]. Microalgae used in organic pol-lutant removal include Monoraphidium braunii, Selenastrum 
capricornutum, Agmenellum quadruplicatum, Pediastrum tetras , 
Ankistrodesmus fusiformis and Amphora coffeaeformis [35]. Annex 1 shows the removal of pollutants by selected microalgae.
3. Phycoremediation techniques
Phycoremediation can be categorized based on the 
attached system or suspension culture system [38]. The 
attached system, which uses algae attached to media, includes microalgal biofilms and algal turf scrubbers (ATSs), while the suspension culture system includes high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs) or naturally suspended sedimentation ponds. Fig. 1 
illustrates the available techniques with a schematic figure, 
while Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages 
of these systems.
3.1. Algal biofilms
Algal biofilms are layers of films containing phototro-
phic microorganisms, which colonize and grow on wetted 
surfaces or surfaces submerged in water in the presence of 
light [39,40], moisture and nutrients [41]. Algal biofilms are 
based on the symbiotic interactions between microalgae S.B. Abd. Razak, Z. Sharip / Desalination and Water Treatment 180 (2020) 164–173 166
and bacteria. The oxygen produced by microalgae during 
photosynthesis is used by bacteria in the biofilm to oxidize the organic matter and nutrients present in the wastewa-ter, while the CO
2 produced during oxidation benefits the 
microalgae for photosynthesis [42]. Furthermore, the phys-ical and chemical properties in algal biofilm communities are determined by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), 
composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, 
and humic acids [41]. EPS plays an important role in assisting 
cell movement, preventing cell desiccation, protecting cells against toxic substances, and providing stability as an adhe-sive material [41]. The EPS production is influenced by bio-
film age, nutrient availability, species composition, response 
to stress and also indirectly linked to temperature and light 
via algal photosynthesis and growth [41].
Microalgal biofilm formation usually starts with the col-
onization of a submerged surface by the first colonizer or 
pioneer species, such as diatoms, followed by domination by 
Cyanobacteria  and green microalgae [38]. In Sekar et al. [43],

open-water reservoir experiments was by Chlorophyceae, then 
by diatoms (Bacillariophyceae ) and lastly by Cyanobacteria . 
Surface media, which have been used for algal biofilms, include plastic sheets or templates, such as polyvinyl chlo-ride [39,44], polystyrene foam [45] and concrete panels [46]. A comparative study on the capability of different media, namely polystyrene foam, cardboard, polyethylene fabric, and loofah sponge, reported the better attachment of Chlorella sp. to polystyrene foam [45]. In another work, the attached growth of microalgal on nylon and stainless-steel mesh was found to be much higher than that of polycarbonate and polyethylene plate [47].
The algal biofilm growth and nutrient removal pattern 
are parallel, where the nutrient uptake capacity was low during the early growth phase, then increased as growth peaked and reduced at the death phase [41]. Schnurr and Allen [48] in their review illustrated the markedly compli-cated growth of algae in biofilms. Species proportions and successions that shape productivities are influenced by var -
ious biotic and abiotic factors [48]. Biofilm thickness, light intensity, flow velocity, and temperature were some of the factors influencing mature biofilm formation and their retainment and removal of nutrients [39,43]. In a study carried out by Jarvie et al. [39], algal biofilm production in the stream was amplified with declining flow velocity and increasing light intensity [13]. The low cost of harvesting through scraping and spooling gives an advantage to the algal biofilm compared to the suspension-based harvesting which uses expensive harvesting procedures such as floccu-lation and centrifugation [25,30–31].
3.2. Algal turf scrubbers
The ATS system is a bioengineering-based technology 
that cultivates and harvests an attached algal community 
in the form of a “turf” [38,49]. The attached algal turf is 
grown on screens on a shallow slopping raceway through 
which water from streams or a waterbody is pumped onto 
the raceway, allowing the algal turf to photosynthesize and 
uptake nutrient or inorganic compounds for their growth 
[38]. The water that contains a much lower nutrient con-
tent will usually be separated by gravity and released back 
into the waterway at the end of the raceway. Common algal 
assemblages on turfs are filamentous green algae, such as 
Spirogyra sp., Microspora sp., Ulothrix sp., Rhizoclonium sp. 
and Oedogonium sp. [38]. These dominant species are accom-
panied by the Cyanobacteria Phormidium sp. and Oscillatoria  
sp., along with benthic diatoms [38]. Screens or attached 
media for turf, which has been used in wastewater treat-
ment include polystyrene mesh [50], nylon net [51,52] and 
high-density polyethylene plastic mesh [53].
This technology has been utilized for controlling non-
point source pollution from agriculture areas and animal wastes [51,52,54], aquaculture facilities [55] and tributaries 
[29]. The controlling factors for successful nutrient removal 
using an ATS are hydraulic retention time (HRT), light levels, 
temperature and wave surge action [38,51]. A raceway slope 
also influences algal productivity; higher production values for filamentous algae have been observed using a 2% slope 
compared to a 1% slope [51], which was likely due to a bet-
ter light environment and drainage flow, and the avoidance of pools of water stuck on the raceway. Besides that, the seasonal variation of nutrient loading resulting from the seasonal changes in water use, such as a dairy wastewater system also affects algal productivity [51]. Low algal growth has been found during the summer months, primarily due to the elevated water temperatures and grazing by snails [51].
3.3. High-rate algal ponds
HRAPs, also known as aerobic ponds, are open systems 
used for cultivating microalgae to treat wastewater [29]. 
They combine oxidation ponds and algal growth systems 
and usually form part of an advanced integrated wastewa-ter system. Since lakes are stagnant water bodies, with sizes 
larger than ponds, the mechanisms and factors influencing 
phycoremediation in lakes are similar to the mechanism 
shaping HRAPs. The major difference is the presence of an 
artificial impeller to oxidize the system and waterbody size. This technique has been widely utilized in treating agricul-
tural, municipal and industrial wastewater. Successful utili-
zation of HRAP includes the treatment of anaerobic effluents 
from pig waste under tropical conditions [15], agricultural 
wastewater [56] and sewage effluents [57], using a natu-
rally developed algal community, but with the operating 
parameters optimized to achieve optimal light conditions [58].
Generally, an HRAP is a shallow pond (0.2–0.5 m) with 
a typical raceway design and water mixed by paddle wheels 
[38,59]. The mixing promotes algal growth and prevents 
biomass settling. The assemblages of algae are developed 
naturally in the HRAP with no special algal species selected 
for inoculating it. Green algae, such as Ankistrodesmus sp., 
Chlorella sp., Chlamydomonas  sp., Euglena sp., Micractinium  
sp., Scenedesmus sp. and the Cyanobacteria  genus Oscillatoria , 
are the most frequently recorded species used in HRAPs [38]. 
Since the 1990s, efforts have been made, with regard to cer -
tain species of algae, such as the Cyanobacterium Phormidium bohneri, to remove nutrients from HRAPs.
Organic matter removal from an HRAP involved a 
mutualistic relationship between bacteria and algae [60]. The algal photosynthesis process provides dissolved oxy-
gen required for decomposing organic matter by aerobic 
bacteria, while the algae benefit from carbon, nitrogen, and 
phosphorus produced by bacteria during the decomposition 
process. Among the factors influencing nutrient and pollut-
ant removal in the symbiotic algae bacteria applications in 
wastewater is HRT [7]. HRT is the amount of time in hours 
for wastewater to pass through a tank, such as an aeration 
tank [61], determined by dividing the volume of the aera-
tion tank into million gallons by the flow rate through the 
aeration tank. The flow rate through the aeration tank must 
be expressed as gallons per hour (gph). The equation is as 
follow:
HRTVolume of aeration tan k
flowrate=  (1)
Under short HRTs and high loading, algae are in their 
logarithmic growth phase [62]. However, studies showed 
longer HRT is better for nitrogen removal compared to short 
HRT, as algae reach their steady growth phase under longer S.B. Abd. Razak, Z. Sharip / Desalination and Water Treatment 180 (2020) 164–173 168
HRTs and this may facilitate the incorporation of more cells 
into the symbiotic biomass net [63,64]. Furthermore, lower HRT was shown to increase the amount of free-swimming algae as well as their concentration in the biomass. Cromar and Fallowfield [65] reported that an increase in retention time from four to 7 d elevates phosphorus removal from 69% to 93%.
Pond depth, which restricts light penetration for algal 
growth, also affects nutrient removal efficiency. Pond depth is also important for determining the biomass concentra-tion as the available light within the pond has been shown to affect microalgal productivity [29]. A shallow pond is recommended as they provide the maximum amount of light to the microalgae and biomass concentration [66]. However, microalgae biomass was unstable in shallow pond (depth < 300 mm) as they react actively to changes in light [67]. Therefore, the balance between light and thermal sta-bility is important for improving microalgal photosynthe-sis. Besides that, Sutherland et al. [67] showed that deeper ponds offer greater areal productivity and nutrient removal, as areal productivity almost doubled in 400 mm deep HRAP compared to 200 mm deep HRAP . Furthermore, a deeper pond is less vulnerable to culture wash-out during heavy rain events than the shallow pond [68]. This suggests that growth in the shallowest HRAP was more constrained than the deepest HRAP even with adequate light and mixing regime.
Organic loading rate and horizontal mixing velocity 
are also important in shaping nutrient removal in HRAPs; a higher frequency of mixing increases microalgal produc-tivity and improves nutrient uptake and treatment [69]. Nutrient removal in HRAP is also dependent on the mech-anisms involved in the productivity of algae, harvesting of biomass, ammonia-nitrogen volatilization and orthophos-phate precipitation [30]. The produced algae biomass in the HRAPs can be harvested using a gravity settling method with harvested productivity ranging between 7.5 to 11.5 g m
–2 d–1.
3.3.1. Harvesting of produced biomass in HRAP
An effective harvesting system is crucial for successful 
phycoremediation in HRAPs in reducing the nutrient load 
because the dead cells will return the nutrients to the system [34], the harvested biomass can be used as aquaculture and livestock feed, extracted for compounds such as pigments, lipids, and fatty acids, which are biodiesel precursors [34] and hydrocarbon as a value-added chemical for the bio-based plastic industry [70]. However, harvesting produced biomass remains one of the major limitations of phycoreme-diation in HRAPs. In contrast to the attached system, where 
algae removal can easily be undertaken by scrubbing the 
media, harvesting methods need to be introduced in HRAPs.
One of the methods suggested in several studies to 
resolve the harvesting problem is the immobilization of 
microalgae [71,72]. By keeping the living cells within a gel 
matrix [73], immobilized algae become an efﬁcient system 
in nutrient removal from wastewater, besides suspension 
cultures. Rai and Mallick [73] showed that immobilized Chlorella and Anabaena have a higher uptake rate for both N and P , probably due to increased cell wall permeability, 
an increase in the cell retention time within bioreactors, and higher metabolic activity [72]. Furthermore, numerous 
factors influence nutrient removal efficiency by immobi-lized algae, including a selection of the most appropriate species [74]. Species isolated from wastewater should show higher efficiency than commercially available ones, due to their significant adaptability to temperature and chemical changes in the medium. In addition, many studies have shown that green algae and Cyanobacteria can be successfully 
immobilized for nutrient removal [71,75,76].
Some major advantages of the immobilization method 
are its capacity to concentrate high biomass for use as by-products, avoid the filtration of treated wastewater, be highly resistant to toxic compounds within treated waste-water, and immobilize more than one microorganism [73]. Immobilization saves the entrapped microalgae from graz-ing by aggressive zooplankton and reduces the competition for nutrients with other microbial species. A small number of studies have also shown that nutrient removal using immobilized algae is much more efficient than the suspended algae method [75,77].
Besides the immobilization method, which is com-
monly used in wastewater treatment, Carmichael et al. [77] studied the harvesting method of Aphanizomenon ﬂos-aquae (Cyanobacteria ) from Klamath Lake for human dietary use, 
which could also be applied to phycoremediation in lakes. The initial process is to use a large harvester to move the A. flos-aquae from the lake to the irrigation canal. From the canal, a large series of screens are used to remove the biomass using the self-powered barge technique.
Another method for harvesting microalgae is floc-
culation. Vandamme et al., [78] reviewed three different technologies used in flocculation (1) chemical flocculation; (2) biological flocculation; and (3) physical flocculation. The disadvantage of chemical flocculation is biomass contami-nation; however, this problem could be minimized by using natural polymers. Meanwhile, biological flocculation by bacteria or fungi may result in the microbiological contam-ination of the biomass, which may also interfere with food or feed applications of the microalgal biomass. On the other hand, physical flocculation methods may avoid contamina-tion of the biomass with chemicals and microorganisms, as they use magnetic nanoparticles for harvesting.
4. Application of phycoremediation in lakes and reservoirs
Applying phycoremediation in lakes will require know-
ledge of the factors controlling primary productivity. 
Temperature, light availability, macro, and micronutrient availability are the basic factors controlling phytoplankton production in lakes [79,80]. Nutrients (e.g. N, P , Si) in rel-
atively fixed proportions are required for algal cell repro-
duction. Reduction in the silica content of eutrophic lakes 
could lead to a change in dominance from the silicifying diatom blooms to the Cyanobacteria blooms [81]. Chroococcus, 
Planktothrix, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, Anabaena, 
Gloeocapsa and Microcystis are among the most commonly 
reported Cyanobacteria in lakes receiving pollutants from 
different sources [82]. Studies have shown that Cyanobacteria  
are efficient in removing nutrients from wastewater as they 
require a higher amount of nutrients (N, P) for their growth 
[26]. Toxin production by toxigenic strains of Cyanobacteria  169 S.B. Abd. Razak, Z. Sharip / Desalination and Water Treatment 180 (2020) 164–173
will affect natural grazers and another aquatic biota, and 
these need to be harvested. Species of the genera Oscillatoria  
and Anabaena are among the most distributed toxin pro-
ducers in eutrophicated freshwaters [26]. Harvesting algae in lakes can be expensive, which means it is not feasible for large-scale applications.
Cyanobacterial dominance depends not only on nutri-
ent enrichment but also on the specific Cyanobacterial spe-cies involved. Understanding the mechanisms influencing Cyanobacteria dominance in lakes such as nutrient ratio, light requirements, and CO
2 competition is important to 
alter them to control their dominance [83]. In contrast to laboratory or pilot conditions, most environmental factors in natural water bodies are not controlled, which may influ-ence algal dominance. In tropical environments, such as Malaysia, controlling temperature to sustain high algal bio-mass, such as on raceways, may not be crucial due to a uni-form warm temperature and a moderate diurnal variation in solar radiation throughout the year [84]. Carbon limitations and pH rises associated with the photosynthetic uptake of CO
2 during periods of peak photosynthesis or algal bloom 
can be a challenge in lake environments.
Reducing nutrient loading, especially involving phos-
phorus, from the catchment is a vital prerequisite to reduce or prevent eutrophication and Cyanobacteria dominance. This can be undertaken through the strict control of influent waterbodies and their pollutant levels, such as rivers that enter a lake, based on an understanding of the total maximum daily load and lake carrying capacity. Additionally, phycore-mediation could be considered as one of the measures to reduce nutrient levels in a waterbody. Fig. 2 illustrates some ways of applying phycoremediation in lakes. One possible method of nutrient removal by algae in lakes is by channel-ing nutrient-rich water from a lake to a raceway constructed on land, then discharging the nutrient-reduced water back into the lake. Alternatively, HRAPs or ATSs can be created at the inlet of water bodies such as the one studied in the Chesapeake Bay tributaries (USA) to reduce nutrient con-tent in water flowing into the lake [51]. Raceways can also be deployed in littoral zones and sheltered areas of lakes where wind effects are at their lowest and the chances for algal bloom occurrence are at their highest. Understanding hydrodynamic patterns of the lake, such as through mod-eling, will enable the selection of the best sites for raceway construction.
Excessive algal bloom, especially Cyanobacteria, is shaped 
by a combination of factors, such as light environment, tem-perature, water turbulence, and water N:P ratio. Different algal bloom species, filamentous or colony-forming, are often difficult to predict due to several interacting factors undermining the lake environment [26]. The success in employing in-lake measures to remove nutrients or har -
vesting algae depends on the lake’s trophic conditions [85]. Hypereutrophic lakes or ponds, especially those located near agricultural areas, which have experienced frequent exces-sive algal bloom, have greater potential in terms of employ-ing phycoremediation techniques to skim or harvest the algae. Manual harvesting of Spirulina or Arthrospira has been carried out in the soda lake of Lake Chad by the local pop-ulation as their food source [86]. Similar manual harvesting of algal biomass has been observed in some urban lakes in Malaysia. During harvesting, toxic Cyanobacteria  should be 
skimmed using an algal skimmer machine to avoid expos-ing the population to toxins produced by the algae. Future research should be carried out to develop and apply low-cost and affordable technology to in-lake algal harvesting.
Another potential phycoremediation method is to alter 
species dominance from Cyanobacteria to diatoms by intro-ducing silica. The in-lake application by Kiran et al. [4,87] showed that dosing a lake with a nano silica-based micro-nutrient mixture shifted the Cyanobacteria blooms to diatom blooms, reducing 56% and 21.4% of nitrate and phosphate, respectively. Diatom blooms reduce the excess nutri-ents (N, P) and carbon in the lake, as they can consume N and P faster than other algae, in addition to being the best sequesters of CO
2. Besides, they are an excellent food 
source for zooplankton and fish, as they are not toxic [87]. Furthermore, their transparent silica shells require less light, thus promoting diatom growth, even on cloudy and rainy days. The combination of these abilities makes diatom spe-cies effective for nutrient removal in lakes
Moreover, studies have also shown that green algae 
(Chlorella and Scenedesmus) display higher tolerance to many 
contaminants and nutrients and are commonly used in wastewater phycoremediation [24]. Wang et al. [88] revealed that the removal rate of NH
4–N and phosphorus by Chlorella  
sp. ranges from 74.7% to 82.4% and 83.2% to 90.6%, respec-tively. However, Ganf and Oliver [89] showed that green algae (Dictyosphaerium pulchellum) was replaced by blue-
green algae (Microcystis aeruginosa) in a stratified lake, due to the vertical separation of light and available nutrients. The presence of gas vesicles permits the vertical movement of Cyanobacteria without the circulation of water. Based on 
the abovementioned criteria, diatom species are probably the most ideal microalgae to be used in the phycoremedia-tion of eutrophic lakes, given their special attributes, such as silica shells, compared to green algae.
5. Technical limitations and adverse environmental effects 
of phycoremediation in lakes
One of the biggest challenges in employing phycoreme-
diation in lakes (including man-made lakes such as reser -
voirs) is to control environmental factors that may influence 
algal dominance. The monitoring of algal communities has not been carried out continuously in many waterbodies to understand the existing ecosystem state. Seasonal factors, such as wet and dry seasons for waterbodies in the trop-ics, strongly influence algae physio-ecology in the system. Different algal species dominance was observed in differ -
ent seasons due to different lake physical and chemical conditions. Waterbodies are strongly shaped by local cli-
mates such as rain, wind and air temperature that cannot 
be controlled. Wind, for example, has a strong influence in 
causing upwelling and downwelling that transport and cir -
culate nutrients within the water column to promote bio-logical productivity in the water bodies. Waterbodies are 
also exposed not only to dust, and other debris but also to 
the infestation of predators that feed on algae, viruses and 
heterotrophic bacteria [85]. All these factors can provide technical constraints in implementing phycoremediation in lakes.S.B. Abd. Razak, Z. Sharip / Desalination and Water Treatment 180 (2020) 164–173 170
Factors such as carbon limitations and pH increase 
during periods of peak photosynthesis or algal bloom can 
limit the application of phycoremediation in waterbodies. A pH rises during periods of algal bloom, commonly observed in hypereutrophic or eutrophic lakes [85] and on raceways [68,90], could affect productivity CO
2 addition has been con-
sidered for raceways and HRAPs to enhance algae produc-tivity and reduce predator grazing by zooplankton [91]. The injection of CO
2 in large quantities into ponds is expensive 
due to additional costs associated with CO2 purification, 
storage, and distribution [92]. Injection of bicarbonate has been suggested as an alternative measure to conventional CO
2 supply, with a potential cultivation cost reduction of 
55% and energy savings of 80%–90% [93].
Channeling nutrient-rich water from a lake to a raceway 
constructed on land for phytoremediation, then discharg-
ing the nutrient-reduced water back into the lake can also 
be challenging. The application of such channeling may be 
restricted by land availability nearby and the large costs involved in system construction and raceway maintenance. The effectiveness of such phycoremediation technique is 
also limited to small water bodies. Channeling is probably 
cheaper than other physical measures, such as desilting or 
dredging, but the energy requirement for operations, as well as maintenance costs, would most likely limit its large-scale application.
Introducing different species of algae or dosing with sil-
ica to alter species dominance is probably limited to small waterbodies. Additionally, the overall implication of intro-ducing silica into lakes, especially natural ones, is not widely known from the environmental perspectives. Application probably should be made in small urban ponds on an experi-mental or pilot scale prior to any application in natural water bodies. More research is also needed to assess the economic feasibility of such an application.
6. Conclusion
Most studies on phycoremediation are focused on waste -
water and effluent treatment. Literature findings show that 
microalgae have a significant effect in terms of reducing nutrient levels and pollutants (including organics and heavy metals) from different wastewater and sewage thus having potential in lake remediation. Knowledge about the lim-itation, effectiveness, and application of phycoremediation in lakes, however, is still limited. Physiology and nutrient removal mechanisms of algae including their ecology were discussed. Potential application of phycoremediation tech-niques in lakes includes using the attached system such as ATS or suspension culture system using HRAP . Technical limitations of applying phycoremediation in lakes and res-ervoirs include addressing carbon limitation during phy-coremediation processes and controlling seasonal changes in natural conditions. Additionally, introducing new algae species in lakes can cause potential environmental ramifi-cations. More phycoremediation studies should be carried out in the natural environment, such as in lakes and ponds, to understand and prove phycoremediation suitability for controlling eutrophication in lakes.
