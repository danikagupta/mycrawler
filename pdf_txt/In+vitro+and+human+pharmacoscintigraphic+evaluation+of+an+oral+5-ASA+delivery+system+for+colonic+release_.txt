ABSTRACT  5 
5-aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) is the most widely used drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The 
benefits of targeted delivery of 5 -ASA to the large int estin e are w ell known, resulting  in reduced 
systemic absorption and increased local concentration s at the disease site. In the present study, a 5 -
ASA colon delivery sy stem based on the time -dependent strategy, exploiting the relatively consistent 
small int estina l transit time (SITT), was manufactured and evaluated in vitro as well as  in vivo . The 10 
system was obtained by successive spray -coating of an immediate -release ta blet core with low -
viscosity HPMC and Eudragit L. The enteric film was effective in prev enting  release during  the acidic 
stage of the in vitro  test, while the HPMC coating brought about reproducible lag phases prior to 
release  in phosphate buffer medium . A γ-scintigraphy investigation  pointed out that, following 
administration to fasted and f ed vol unteers, disintegration of the units never occurred prior to colon 15 
arrival. In all cases, a lag time preceded the appearance of the drug and its N -acetyl metabolit e in the 
bloodstream , which was found to correlate with the time of disintegration  in a linea r mode . The plasma 
levels of the drug and metabolite as well as their cumulative urinary recovery were relatively low with 
respect to  those reported  when 5-ASA is deliver ed to the small bowel.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
5-aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) , also k nown as mesalazine or mesalamine,  is the  first-line and most 
widely used  treatment for remission and maintenance of remission of mild -to-moderate ulcerative 
colitis (UC) (Feagan, 2003; Ham and Moss, 2012; Sandborn, 2008) . UC i s a potentially debilitat ing 
chronic inflammatory pathology  that, together with Crohn's disease,  affects over three  million people in 5 
Europe and North America,  show ing a currently increasing trend in developing countries of non -
Western areas  (Molodeck y et al., 2012; Ng et al., 20 17). 
Because it has been proved to act locally, selective de livery of 5-ASA  to the disease site, via oral or 
rectal administration , is generally pursued (Friend, 2005; Perrotta et al., 2015) . This enhance s the 
efficacy  and tolerability associated with the therapy , by increasing the dose fraction reaching the  10 
inflamed mucosa and reducing that entering the systemic circulation  due to  poor colonic absorption  
In order to obtain  effective levels of 5 -ASA in the large bowel following oral intake, proper delivery 
strategies need to be used  (Karrout et al., 2015; Qureshi and Cohen, 2005; Sardo et al., 2019) . The vast 
majority  of commercially -available 5-ASA products relate to  a pH-dependent strategy  (Maroni et al., 
2017b; Sandborn and Hanauer, 2003) . The basic concept behind that  is the aboral  increase in the 15 
gastrointestinal  pH, which ranges from acidic values of the gastric fluid  to neutral  or slightly alkaline 
ones of the distal intestine  contents . Accordingly,  coated dosage forms  provided with an  enteric film 
are used, and polymers soluble at pH > 6.0 or 7.0, primarily polymethacrylates such as  Eudragit® S and 
Eudragit® L, are generally em ployed as the coating agents  (Maroni et al., 2013b; Pa lugan et al., 2015) . 
Nevertheless , it has broadly been highlighted that these coatings may not be suitable for site -selective 20 
release to the colon  (Ashford et al., 1993; Ibekwe et al., 2008, 2006) . Indeed, while the dissolution pH 
threshold of such polymers can physiologically be exceeded in the small intestine, it may fail to be 
reached in the proximal colon, where acidic values are often encountered particularly in active phases 4 
 of UC (Fallingborg et al., 1993; Nugent et al., 2001) . Moreover, there is large intra - and inter -patient 
variability in the intestinal pH profile. Therefore, the likelihood of both premature release and of 
release failure is to be accounted for . In the lack of effective and reliable targeting,  mucosal levels of 5 -
ASA may vary , thus affecting the clinical response rate  (Klotz and Schwab, 2005) . 
Although no re lated drug products are found on the marketplace, colon delivery approaches that 5 
leverage physiological parameters other than the luminal pH have been proposed and extensively 
studied (Gazzaniga et al., 1994; McConnell et al., 2009; Pinto, 2010; Wolk et al., 2013) . Among these, 
the time -dependent strategy exploits the small intestinal trans it time (SITT) (Davis, 1985; Gazzaniga et 
al., 2006) . It has been shown that SITT has duration of 3±1 h (mean±sd) and is relatively little 
influenced by variables such as the fasted/fed state of subjects, the kind of dosage forms and, in the 10 
case of solids, the size and density of the latter. In addition, because it is no inherent physiological 
characteristic of the colonic region, SITT would to a lesser extent undergo pathological alterations 
associated with U C as compared with the local pH and the composition o f the microbiota (Bak et al., 
2018)  . 
Time -dependent delivery systems are generally coated dosage forms, wherein a pH -independent 15 
coating material is responsible for a  programmable lag phase prior to release (Gazzaniga et al., 2006; 
Maroni et al., 2013b) . In order to turn time -programm ed into site -selective release , the impact of 
unpredictable gastric residence time is to be overcome, which is commonly  accomplished through the 
use of a gast roresistant outer coating. Furthermore, the lag phase needs to be sufficiently ext ended to 
cover t he whole small intestinal transit. Taking account of the generally long -lasting transit of dosage 20 
forms in the large intestine, lag phases of 6  to 7 h may reasonably prevent early drug release into the 
proximal g astrointestinal tract while still allow ing for targeted delivery to the ascending colon  (Wilson, 
2010) . According to the nature of the inner coati ng polymer and the formulation of the core,  the drug 5 
 release may be deferred through a range of mechanisms  (Maroni et al., 2013c) . When swellable  
hydrophilic  polyme rs, typically soluble cellulose derivatives, are used as coating agents, release is 
delayed due to their slow interaction with the aqueous gastrointestinal fluids and consequent 
dissolution and /or erosion in the hydrated state (Maroni et al., 2016b) . 
A previously described  delivery system , provided with a functio nal low -viscosity HPMC layer applied 5 
by spray -coating, has been proved to fulfi ll the desired release behavior  in vitro  and in vivo, with lag 
phases increasi ng in duratio n as a function of the thickness of such a layer  (Sangalli et al., 2001; Zema 
et al., 2007) . Moreover, colonic breakup was highlighted by γ-scintigraphy following administration of 
placebo  units to healthy volunteers. Various configurations of this deli very platform were  proposed by 
using different cores (Del Curto et al., 2014, 2011, 2009; Maroni et al., 2013a)  and alternative 10 
manufacturing techniques (Macchi et al., 2015; Foppoli et al., 20 17; Melocchi et al., 2018; Sangalli et 
al., 2009; Zema et al., 2013) . Particularly, in the form of coated insu lin minitab lets, the system brought 
about  more than two-fold bioavailability and ten -fold pharmacological availability vs a reference 
uncoated fo rmulation  for immediate release  when administered to diabetic rats  (Maroni et al., 2016a) . 
Based on the current need f or effectively targeted pharmaco logical therapy of IBD, the aim of the 15 
present study was to manufacture, according to the above -mentioned  delivery technology, an oral 
system for colonic release o f 5-ASA, and to eval uate the re levant in vitro as well as  in vivo 
performance. The manufactur ing step  involved (i) preparation of immediate -release tablet cores 
containing 400 mg  of the drug, (ii) application of a low -viscosity HPMC layer of approximately 750 
µm in thickness,  by virtue of previous in vivo  studies  of analogous systems  (Maroni et al., 2016a; 20 
Sangalli et al., 2009, 2001) , and (iii) enteric coat ing of the HPMC -coated units. After physico -
technological and in vitro  release characterization, combined pharmacokinetic and scintigraphic 
investigation into the performance of the fi nal deliver y system was carried out in he althy volunteers.  6 
 2. MATERIALS AN D METHODS  
2.1. MATERIALS  
5-aminosalcylic acid (5-ASA , Chemi, I), povidone (Kollidon®25 BASF, D) and crospovidone  
Kollidon® CL, BASF, D) , glyceryl dibehenate  (Compritol®888 ATO , Gattefossé,  F), lactose  
(Pharmatose DCL11  DMW, NL), samarium oxide (Sigma -Aldri ch, US), hydroxypropyl 5 
methylcellulose (HPMC , Methocel® E50, Colorcon , US; MW 65-80 kDa), polyethylen e glycol (PEG 
6000 , Hoechst , UK) , poly(methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate) 1:1  copolymer (Eudragit® L30D , 
Evonik, D), triacetin and t alc (Tradeco , I). 
 
2.2. METHODS  10 
2.2.1. Manufactur ing and physic o-technological characterization of the 5-ASA delivery system  
1.5 l of povidone aqueous solution (10% w/v) was slowly added to 1.6 kg of 5 -ASA powder  and 
knea ded in a high shear mixer at 100 rpm for 5 min (Roto J unior  10L Zanchetta -Romaco, I) . The wet 
mass was forced through a 250 µm net sieve of an oscillating granulator ( AR400 Erweka, D) .  The 
resulting  granules were oven -dried at 40 °C for 20 h and sieve -calibrated  (500 µm) . 0.396 kg of 15 
lactose, 0.072 kg of crospovidone, 0.032 kg of talc, 0.032 kg of glyceryl behenate , and 0.040 kg of 
samarium dioxide were a dded  and mixed  in a V-blender  (Erweka, D ). The mixture was tableted by a 
rotar y machine (AR 13 Ronchi, I; concave punches diameter 11 mm , curvature radius  9 mm) set to 
provide adequate mechanical characteristics of the cores, so that these could withstand the subsequent 
coating steps while maintaining prompt disintegration properties upon exposure to aqueous  media. 20 
Tablets wer e checked for weight (n=20), heigh t and diameter (digital  micrometer  Mitutoyo, J; n=20), 
crushing strength (crushing tes ter TBH30 Erweka, D; n=10) , friability ( friabilometer TA3R  Erweka, D) 
and disintegra tion time ( three-position disin tegration apparatus Advanced Products , I; n=6). The 7 
 weight, height , diameter , crushing strength , friabi lity and disintegration  time were 555.2±2.8 mg, 
6.453±0 .037 mm, 11.072±0 .004 mm, 81±19 N, <1 % and <1 min, res pectively.  
The 5-ASA tablet co res were coate d in fluid bed eq uipment (Uniglatt, Glatt , D) using an  aqueous 
solution of Methocel® E50 (7.5% w/v) and PEG 600 0 (0.5% w/v ) under t he following process 
conditions: batch size 1 kg , inlet air temperature  60-64 °C, outlet  air temperature 39-44 °C, nebulizing  5 
air pressure 3.5 bar, nozzle port size 1.2 mm . The co ating level  was monitored by measuring  the 
weight  and height as well as diame ter (digital micrometer ) of samples (n=10) collected at successive 
time points . The coating thickness was calcul ated as half o f the mean differ ence between the height 
and diameter  of coated units and cores , respectively .  
Coated systems having selected wei ght gains , in a 10-50% range  (M10, M 20, M30, M40 an d M50 ), 10 
were cross -sectio ned and the thickness of  the applie d layer  was measured on images  acquired by d igital 
microscope  (Dyno -Lite Pro AM -413T, AnMo Electronics Co ., TW). Thickness data were the mean of 
measurements performed in 8 different regions of the HPMC layer of each of 3 coated units . 
Enteric c oating disp ersions (Eudragit® L30D 35% w/ v; Triacetin 3 % w/v, Talc 7% w/ v, deionized 
water  55 w/v ) were applied  onto HPMC -coated cores  having nominal 50% we ight gain  to give final 15 
gastroresistant systems  (GM50). The coating process was run up to  approximately  3% weight gain  
using the same fluid bed appa ratus  under th e following condi tions: batch size 1 kg , inlet air 
temperature 60-62 °C, outlet air temperatur e 39-41 °C, nebulizing air pressure 1.5 bar , nozzle port size 
1.2 mm . Mass uniformity of the final double -coated system was assessed  (CV=0.58).  
SEM photomicrograph s of cross -sectioned final double-coated units were taken  and used to assess the 20 
thickne ss of the enteric coating and confirm that of the HPMC  layer . Samples were gold sputtered 
using a plasma evaporator under vacuum, and photomicrographs were acquired at an accelerated 
voltage of 10 kV at different magnificatio ns (Leo 1430, Carl Zeiss, CH).  8 
  
2.2.2. In vitro evaluation  
For release test ing, a three -position  disintegration apparatus was used  in place  of a dissolution 
equipment  to avoid adhesion of swollen  HPMC  layer of the coated system to the vessels , which would 
impact on data reliability  (Zema et al., 2007) . Each unit was inser ted into a basket -rack assembly so 5 
that only one of the 6 available tubes was occupied. The basket -rack assemblies moved in separate 
vessels at a constant 29 to 32 cycles/min freq uency throu gh a 55±2 mm distance, immersed in 800 ml 
of fluid at 37±1 °C, i.e . hydrochloric acid solution pH 1.2 for 2 h (gastrore sistant systems only) and/or 
phosphate buffer pH 6.8.  
Fluid samples were withdrawn continually for spectroph otometrical  assay  (λ=244 nm) at fixed time 10 
points and subsequently  reintroduced into the ve ssel. Release t ests (n=3) were carried out  under sink  
conditions , here meant as  those at which the concentration of the drug was <20% of its solubility in 
phosphate buffer pH 6 .8 at 37  °C (~3.5 g/l) (Karkossa and Klein, 2018) .  
In vitro  lag time was expressed as the time required for  10% drug release in phosp hate buffer  pH 6.8 
(t10%) and calculated by linear interpolation of the experimental data immediately  before and after this 15 
release percentage . 
 
2.2.3. Pharmacoscintigraphic eva luation   
The in vivo evaluation was carried out as an open -label , single -dose study in 6 healthy male Caucasian 
volunteers aged 18 to 45 years , who received the  test formulation  (GM50) in fasted an d fed condition s 20 
according to  a randomized two-period cross over design  (washout of 7 day s). The investigation  was 
undertaken at the U. L.B., Faculté de Méde cine, Hôpital Erasme, Service des R adioisotopes (Brussel s, 
BE). The protocol was gra nted appro val by a registered ethics committee , in compliance with local 9 
 regulations. The study was perfo rmed  in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its 
subsequ ent revisions . The enrolled subjects  gave written informed consent  and, prior to beg inning, 
underwent  a thorough medical examination. These controls were repeat ed at discharge.  No medicatio ns 
were allowed during the study  period . 
Formulation GM50 was irradiated in a neutron flux of 2·1012 cm-2/s for 4 min,  so that the stable isotope 5 
152Sm could  be converted in to the γ-emitting  radionuclide  153Sm (Wilding et al., 2001) . Release testing 
after neutron irradiation confirmed that no altera tions were brought about by such a procedure . At the 
time of dosing, the  formulation was  radiolabelled with 3.0 MBq . For each study session , 1.85 MBq 
99mTc-colloid in 100 m l of water was also administered to out line the gastrointestinal tract . 
On each admi nistration day , at 8.00 a.m., all volunteers took orally a single dose of the radiolabeled 10 
formulation  with 100 m l of tap water  at room temperat ure. In the fed administration regimen, a  
standard breakfast  of same composi tion was se rved 30 min before intake . Standard lunch, sn ack and 
dinner were served to all volunteers at 4, 8 and 12 h post -dose,  respectively. At 24 h post -dose, 
breakfast was allowed as prescribed in  the balanced standard diet the volunteers  had to follow in the 3 
days preceding administration. Neither food no r drink apart f rom these meals were permitted  (except 15 
for water) .  
The s ubjects were placed in supine position under the collimator of the γ-camera, and i mages of 2 min 
in duration  were acquired just before inta ke (t=0) and at the scheduled time points of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 24 h post -dose.  Actual imaging times are reported in the Results and 
Discussion se ction. Gastric emptying time (GE) , colon arrival time (CA) , small intest inal transit time 20 
(SITT)  and time of disintegration (td) as well as  site of disintegration  (sd), i.e. when and where 
dispersed fragments  from disintegrated  units were first observed , respec tively,  were assessed . Time of 
disintegration after gastric emptyin g (t d-GE) was  calculated by subtracting GE from td.  10 
 Blood sampl ing was scheduled just before intake of the dosage fo rm (t=0),  every hour up to 12 h and at 
24 h post -dose. Actual sampl ing t imes are reported in the Results and Discussion section . Urine was 
also collected prior to administration, from 0 to 12 h and from 12 to 24 h.  5-ASA and its metabolite N -
acetyl 5 -ASA ( Ac5-ASA) were assayed in the plasma and urine by a HPLC validated m ethod  with 
fluorescence detection  adapted from (Fischer et al., 1981) . The limit of quanti tation , defined as the 5 
analyte concentration that provides a  relative  response  with a coefficient of variation not exceeding 20 , 
was 5 ng/m l for both 5 -ASA and  Ac5-ASA in the plasma, and,  in urine, 0.25 µg/m l for 5 -ASA and 5 
µg/m l for Ac5-ASA.  
Lag time prior to appearance of the drug  (tlag5-ASA) and of the metaboli te (tlagAc5 -ASA) in the bloodstream 
was expressed as the time at wh ich 5 -ASA and Ac5-ASA were first assayed in the plasma . 10 
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
3.1. IN VITRO EVALUATION  
Tablet cores containing  5-ASA  underwent  aqueous spray -coating with low-viscosity HPMC  as 15 
previously described , in order to obtain a lag phase prior to re lease , according to  the time -dependent 
approach to colon delivery  (Sangalli et al., 2001) . The operating parame ters were preliminarily set up, 
and slight adjustment s were progressivel y required  due to the growing  mass of the substrate. Coated 
formulations  having nominal 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 % weight gain  (codes M10, M20 , M30, M40 and 
M50)  were subjec ted t o physico -technological and release characterization . Consistent weight and 20 
coati ng thickness as well as a  smooth surface were observed (Table I, Figure s 1 and 2). A linear 
correlation (R2=0.9973)  was found between the weight gain of the units and the thickness of the 
HPMC layer (Figure 3).  The pursued nominal thickness of 750 µm corre sponded to a  weight gain of 11 
 approximately 50% . The coated systems, subje cted to  crushing test, were  deformed without breaking  at 
applied fo rces up to  300 N. Only in the c ase o f M10, signs of rupture were noticed.  
The release profiles  from uncoated cores an d HPMC -coated units , obtained in phosphate buffer pH 6.8  
under sink conditions , are reported in Figure 4 . A lag phase preced ed the onset of 5-ASA  release  in all 
cases . By incr easing the coating lev el, the duration of the lag phase was extended. A slow release phase 5 
due to outward dr ug diffusi on was especially evident in the case of formulations having t he greater 
weight gain ( M40 and M50 ). After wards , release was promp t and qua ntitative, associated with the 
observed breakup  of the swollen polymer layer. The relationship between the c oating thickness and the 
duration of the lag  phase, expressed as t 10%, was found linear (Figure 5) . This finding was consistent 
with previo us ones  relevant to coated syst ems h aving tableted cores of smaller size , cores of different 10 
nature (hard and soft ge latin capsules)  or functional polymeric layers fabricated by different t echniques 
(injection -molding, fused deposition modelling ) (Gazzaniga et al., 2011; Maroni et al., 2017a; Sangalli 
et al., 2009) . 
Formulation M50 , having coating thickness of approximate ly 765 µm (~68 mg/cm2), was thus 
provided  with an enteric film intended to prevent interaction of the HPMC layer with the aqueous  fluid  15 
in the stomach , thus overcoming the influence of highly variable gastric residence time on  the intestinal 
site of relea se. Application of  the enteric soluble polymer  led to an increase in thickness of 
approximately  60 µm  (~4.5 mg/cm2) in the final double-coated system (GM50). Evaluated for release 
according to the compendial two -stage testing procedure, the gastroresistant  units  were proved to 
withstand 2 h in HCl solution. The release pattern  observed after switching to phosphate buffer pH 6.8 20 
was consistent with that shown by the corresponding non -gastroresistant formulation , with non -
significantly different t10% (p=0.79) (Figure 6) . Enteric coating  was thus demonstra ted not to impact on 
the performance of  the HPMC layer . 12 
  
3.2. IN VIVO EVALUATION  
A pharmacoscintigraphic investigation was undertaken in 6 healthy male volunteers, under fasted and 
fed conditions.  γ-scintigrap hy was used to study the transit of the adminis tered  dosage forms (GM50) 
throughout the gastrointestinal tract and the site as well as  time of relevant breakup . Moreover , 5-ASA  5 
and its N -acetyl derivative , resulting from intestinal and hepatic  metabol ism, were assayed in plasma 
samples collected within the im aging  time frame in order to concurrently monitor their concentration  in 
the systemic circulation (De V os, 2000; Goebell et al., 1993; Klotz and Schwab, 2005) . Cumulative 
urinary recovery of both compounds was also assessed.   
All volunteers concluded the trial without any remarkab le side effect or alteration in the main clinical 10 
parameters that could be re lated to the treatment.  Pharmacoscintigraphic results are presented  in Tables 
II and III as well as  in Figures 7  and 8.  Horizontal bars are superimposed to c oncentration vs time 
curves of 5-ASA  and Ac5-ASA  to highlight concomitant  position and disinte gration of the units within 
the gastrointestinal tract . 
A lag phase  followed by appearance of the drug and its metabolite in the plasma  was in all cases 15 
observed . As expected, 5-ASA  levels turned out fa r lower than Ac5-ASA  ones (Bondesen et al., 1988; 
Goebell et al., 1993) . Overall , the concentrations of the drug  and metabolite  pointed o ut poor 
absorption, possibly consistent with distal intestinal release  (Bondesen et al., 1988; Myers et al., 1987) . 
This was in line with  cumulative urinary recovery  of 5-ASA and Ac5 -ASA , which n ever exceed ed 
20% of the administered  dose.  20 
Gastric residence was variable  in duration , being generally shorter in the fasted regimen (p < 0.05).  
Both in fasted and fed subjects, average  SITT was in good agreement with previous findings, which the 
time-dependent colon delivery  approach relies  on [21,46] . Colon arrival was always within 5 h  post-13 
 dose. Notably, in no cases disintegration  occurred before the uni ts had entered the large bowel , and  
residual radioactivity , ranging from 10 to 100%, was still observed  in the colon at 24 h  after intake.  
In 8 cases out of 12, disintegration of the units and appearance of 5-ASA  and/or Ac 5-ASA  took place  
within 12 h  after administration , the metabolite being detected either earlier than the parent drug or  at 
the same time poin t. In those 8 cases, the time at which disintegration was first observed after gastric 5 
emptying (td-GE) turned out to be 8.73±2.85 h and 7.77±3.10 h for fasted and fed subjects, respectively , 
indicat ing no major influence of food intake  (p=0 .66). The sit e of disintegration  (sd), i.e. where 
dispersed fragments from disintegrated units were evident for the first time , was the caec um in one 
case (2Fa), the ascending colon in 5 cases ( 3Fa, 4Fa, 2Fe, 3Fe, 4Fe) and the transverse colon in the 
remaining 2 cases ( 1Fa, 6Fe). The time of disintegration (t d), i.e. when  the dispersed fragments  were 10 
first seen , followed  (1Fa, 3Fa, 4Fa, 2Fe, 3Fe, 4Fe, 6Fe) or coincid ed with (2Fa ) the time at which Ac5 -
ASA was first assayed in the plasma (t lagAc5 -ASA), the metabolite being  detected  generally earlier than 
the parent drug because of  its higher concentration . Diffusion of 5-ASA through the swollen 
hydrophilic polymer coating may thus have taken place  before  breakup of the unit s. The time elapsing 
from the detection of Ac5 -ASA in the plasma to that of dispersed fragments in the intestine, i.e. the 15 
difference  between  tlagAc 5-ASA and td, was 0.81±0.56 h in fasted subjects and  1.27±0.59 h in fed ones.  A 
good linear  correlation  was found  between t lagAc5 -ASA and t d in both fasted and  fed regimen s, with the 
slope  of regression lines  reflecting  the occurrence of metabolite absorption  prior to  break up of the units  
(Figure 9). 
In th ose 4 cases where disintegration was not observed within 12 h after intake  (5Fa, 6Fa, 1Fe, 5Fe), a 20 
comprehen sive evaluation of the performance of the dosage form was hindered by the lack of 
information between 12 h and 24 h , time interval  during which  neith er imaging nor blood sampling 
were  scheduled.  These specific  cases are discussed into detail as follows.  14 
 In subject 6Fa, 5-ASA  and Ac 5-ASA  appeared in the plasma 11 .2 h after intake , while  disintegration 
was not seen in the images taken up to 12 h . Fragme nts from the d isintegrated unit  were  observed  at 24 
h post -dose in the transverse  and descending colon , and residual radioactivity was 83%. The plasma 
concentrations of drug and metabolite, along with  their overall cumulative urinar y recovery , were of 
such an extent as to indicate  that breakup would have occurred within the “blind” time lapse well 5 
before the 24 th hour post -dose. Through  the linear  relationship presented in Figure 9, breakup was 
estimated  at 12.55 h. Based on colon ar rival time, this would reasonably be consistent with the unit 
being positioned in the ascending  and/or transverse  colon.  
Analogous  considerations can be drawn from scintigraphic and pharmacokinetic data relevant to 
subject 5Fe. In this case, t d was estima ted at 13 .87 h. At 24 h  post-dose, radioactivity in the transverse 10 
and descending  colon was still 100%.  
In the same subject under f asted condition (5Fa), plasma levels of drug and metabolite as well as the 
disintegrated unit were detected at 24 th hour only, fragments of the dosag e form  being positioned  in 
the transverse and descending  colon . Therefore , estimation of t d based on the li near regression model 
was not possible in this instance , and no hypothes is could accordingly be made about  the site of 15 
disint egration.  However , plasm a concentrations and urinary recovery of 5-ASA  and Ac5 -ASA, 
relatively high and comparable with data from  the same subject in  the fed state, suggest breakup of the 
unit should be trace d back to several hours before the last sampling  time at 24 h after inta ke.  
In subject 1Fe , only very low 5-ASA and Ac5 -ASA plasma levels , and as little as 10% of residual 
radioa ctivity in the distal part of the descending colon, were found at 24 h . By the same time, neither 20 
the drug nor the metabolite  was recovered in the ur ine. These results would  indicate that breakup 
occurred just before the last time point and the unit was vo ided soon after disintegration . 15 
 Overall , the administered dosage forms disintegrated and released their drug load in the larg e intestine, 
under both fasted and fed conditions of the subjects participating in the study.

4. CONCLUSIONS  
In the present work,  an oral 5 -ASA delivery system aimed at time-dependent colonic release was 
manufacture d and evaluate d in vitro as well as  in he althy volunteers, by γ-scintigraphy and 
pharmacokinetics techniques . The system encompassed an immediate -release drug -containing ta blet 
core, a low -viscosity HPMC layer  deferring the onset of release  and an enteric outer coating  protecting 10 
the inner formul ation from contact wi th gastric fluid during poorly predictable stomach  residence . 
The expected  in vitro  performance was confirmed , with lag time extended  as a function of the HPMC 
coating level . A phase of diffusive release  of a relatively small percentag e of the drug  appeare d with 
increasing coating thickness . 
The imaging study  showed  that disintegration of the administered units was in no cases observed prior 15 
to colon arrival . Breakup mainly  occurred in the caecum, ascending or transverse colon. Notably,  the 
small intestinal  transit time was proved  fairly reproducible and consistent with the tenets of the time -
dependent formulation strategy.  These findings were independent of the fasted or fed dosing regimen.  
A lag phase following administration  always pr eceded the appearance  of the drug and its main 
metabolite in the bloodstream. An agreement was found between this lag time and  the onset of 20 
disintegration of the units. 5-ASA and Ac5 -ASA were generally detected  approximately 1 h before 
breakup could be obs erved, which may refl ect the diffusive release phase noticed in the in vitro  study.  
After the lag phase, the concentrations of drug  and metabolite reached in the plasma were relatively 16 
 low as compared with data obtained following delivery of the drug to mo re proximal regions o f the gut . 
This was consistent with the mean cumulative urinary recovery of 5 -ASA and Ac5 -ASA over 24 h  that 
was below 10% of the drug dose d. 
On average, the time taken for the dosage form to disintegrate after emptying from the stomac h, where 
swelling of the functional HPMC coating was prevent ed by the gastroresistant film, turned out slightly  5 
longer than should in principle be pursued according to the time -dependent colon delivery  approach . 
However, the results obtained were mostly  satisfactory in terms o f large intestinal  targeting . Therefore, 
though with due caution in view of the need for avoiding  early releas e into the small bowel, 
formulation changes could be implemented  to possibly shorten  the in vivo  lag time , thus offering  better 
chances of drug de livery into the proximal colon and reducing the risk of release failure.  10
