67INTRODUCTION
Decolorization  of azo dyestuffs  by sequential  
reactions  involves  the degradation  of azo dye by 
reduction  or cleavage  of azo bond  by anaerobic  
digestion  and ultimate  biotransformation  of 
aromatic  amines  in aerobic  conditions . The 
limited  past investigations  have  shown  that azo 
dyes can be completely  decolorized  and some  
intermediates  such as aromatic  amines  with side 
groups  (–SO3, –OH, –COOH , –Cl, –N) containing  
metabolites  were  quantitatively  detected  (O’Neill  
et al., 2000 : Luangdilok  and Panswad , 2000 :Van 
Der Zee et al., 2003 ). 
The successful  application  of anaerobic  
technology  for the treatment  of industrial  
wastewaters  depends  on the development  of high-
rate bioreactors , which  achieve  a high reaction  rate 
per unit reactor  volume  by retaining  the biomass  in DECOLORIZATION AND BIOLOGICAL DEGRADATION OF AZO DYE

ABSTRACT
This study investigates the anaerobic treatability of reactive Red2 in an anaerobic/aerobic sequential process. 
Laboratory scale anaerobic baffled reactor and fixed activated sludge reactor were operated at different organic 
loadings and hydraulic retention times. The effects of shock dye concentration on the chemical oxygen demand 
and color removal efficiencies were investigated in the anaerobic baffled reactor. The effect of hydraulic retention 
time on the color and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies were also investigated in the aerobic reactor. 
The studies were carried out in continuous mode and the effluent of the anaerobic baffled reactor was used as 
feed for the fixed activated sludge reactor. Chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 54.5% was obtained at 
HRT =1 day in the anaerobic reactor. The average color removal was 89.5%. Chemical oxygen demand removal 
efficiency of 69% was obtained at HRT =7 h in the aerobic fixed activated sludge reactor. A slight decrease of the 
color was also observed in the aerobic reactor. This investigation has shown that successful treatment of a highly 
colored wastewater is possible in the anaerobic baffled reactor. Also the results showed that, anaerobic biological 
system has higher efficiency in dye removal than fixed activated sludge system, while aerobic system has higher 
efficiency in chemical oxygen demand removal comparing with the anaerobic baffled reactor.

baffled  reactor  (ABR ) is a high-rate reactor  that 
contains  between  3 and 8 compartments  in which  
a series  of vertical  baffles  force  the wastewater  
to flow under  and over the mass  it passes  from  
inlet to outlet  (Barber  and Stuckey , 1999 , Sponza  
and Isik, 2002 ). The bacteria  within  the reactor  
gently  risen , settle  due to flow characteristics  and 
gas production  in each compartment  but move  
horizontally  down  the reactor  at a relatively  slow  
rate giving  rise to cell retention  time (CRT ) of 
100 day at 20 h hydraulic  retention  time (HRT ); 
therefore  the wastewater  can come  into intimate  
contact  with large  amounts  of active  biomass  as 
it passes  through  the ABR  with short  HRT  (6-20 
h), while  the effluent  remains  relatively  free of 
biological  solids  (Grobicki  and Stuckey , 1991 ).
In a study  performed  by Sponza  and Isik (Sponza  
and Isik, 2002 ) the color  and chemical  oxygen  A. Naimabadi, et al., DECOLORIZATION AND BIOLOGICAL...
68demand  (COD ) removal  efficiencies  were  
investigated  using  anaerobic /aerobic  reactors  
(UASB , CSTR ) for treatment  of 100 mg/L of 
Reactive  Black  5. A total of 67% COD  and 95% 
color  removal  efficiencies  were  obtained  while  
glucose  was used as carbon  source .
 O’Neill  demonstrated  75% color  removal  
efficiency , in an upflow  anaerobic  sludge  blanket  
(UASB )/activated  sludge  reactor  system  treating  
reactive  Red 141 (O’Neill  et al., 1999 ). In a 
study  performed  by An et al, 83% color  and 
69% COD  removal  efficiencies  were  obtained  
in anaerobic  (HRT  =6–10  h) and aerobic  (HRT  
=6.5 h) sequential  reactors  degrading  acid yellow  
and basic  Red dyes at organic  loading  rate of 5.3 
kgCOD /m³ day and a COD  concentration  of 1200  
mg/L(An et al., 1996 ) Bell and Buckley  obtained  
86% decolorization  efficiency  in an anaerobic  
baffled  reactor  at an organic  loading  rate of 4g 
COD /L using  sucrose  as carbon  source . It was 
observed  that 250 mg/L of reactive  Red 141 was 
degraded  with 90% COD  removal  efficiency  in 
anaerobic  reactor  (Bell and Buckley , 2004 ).
Probably  the most  significant  advantage  of 
ABR  is its ability  to separate  acidgenesis  and 
methanogensis  longitudinally  down  the reactor . 
The latter  causes  sift in bacterial  populations  
allowing  increased  protection  against  toxic  materials  and higher  resistance  to changes  
in environmental  parameters  such as pH and 
temperature  (Barber  and Stuckey , 1999 ). 
The objective  of this study  was to investigate  the 
color  as well as organic  carbon  measured  in terms  
of chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD ) removal  
efficiencies  in anaerobic /aerobic  sequential  
reactors . In this study  the effect  of operational  
conditions  (shock  dye concentration , HRT  and 
pH) on the treatability  of reactive  Red 2 were  
investigated  in an anaerobic  ABR  and aerobic  
fixed  activated  sludge  (FAS) reactors .
MATERIALS  AND  METHODS
Reactor
Continuously  fed anaerobic  ABR  and aerobic  
FAS reactors  were  used in sequence  for the 
experimentation . A 5-compartment  laboratory –
scale  ABR  was set up in a constant  room  
temperature  of 35˚C. The ABR  reactor  had an 
effective  volume  of 13 L; the FAS reactor  consisted  
of an aerobic  tank (effective  volume  =3.2L and fix 
bed volume  =0.8L) and a settling  compartment  
(effective  volume  =1.6L). A schematic  drawing  
of the lab- scale  sequential  ABR  and FAS reactor  
used in this study  is presented  in Fig.1. The 
effluent  of anaerobic  ABR  reactor  was used as 
the influent  of aerobic  FAS reactor .

Seed
The reactor  (ABR ) was seeded  with 8.2L (1.64 L/
compartment ) of screened  digester  sludge  taken  
from  a south  wastewater  plant  in Isfahan  (total 
solids =35g/L, volatile  solids =25 g/L). The sludge  
was left to settle  for one week  before  feeding  
began . Activated  sludge  culture  obtained  from  the 
wastewater  plant  in Isfahan  (total solids =12g/L, 
volatile  solids =8 g/L) was used as seed for the 
aerobic  FAS reactorComposition  of synthetic  wastewater
Reactive  Red 2 was obtained  from  a textile  
factory  in Isfahan . The synthetic  feed containing  
(per liter) glucose  =4g; peptone =0.89g ; meat  
extract =0.4g; K2HPO4=0.08g ; NaHCO3=1.5g ; 
and also the trace  minerals  COCl2.6H2O , 
FeCl2.4H2O , MnCl2.4H2O , Na2MoO4.2H2O  
and NiCl2.6H2O  were  fed to the reactor  during  
startup  (Bell and Buckley , 2003 ). Once  the Fig.1. Schematic configuration of lab-scale anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactorsIran. J. Environ. Health. Sci. Eng., 2009, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 67-72
69reactor  had reached  steady  state, at a 50 HRT, 
the CI reactive  Red 2 dye was added  to the feed 
solution . The COD  concentration  to the reactor  
was maintained  at 4 g COD /L, which  represented  
the COD  of waste  streams  produced  in the dyeing  
process ; the COD  of the dye was negligible . To 
achieve  acclimation , the concentration  of CI 
reactive  Red 2 was increased  stepwise  from  30 
mg/L, to 100 mg/L on day =83, to 250 mg/L on 
day =112, to 350 mg/L on day =133. Throughout  
the experimental  period , the reactor  was supplied  
with a constant  COD  loading  of 5 g COD /L.d of 
the synthetic  feed cosubstrate .
Analytical  methods
COD  in influent  and effluent  samples  were  
determined  by closed  reflux  colorimetric  method  
(Lenore  et al., 2005 ). Color  measured  in the influent  
and effluent  sample  of anaerobic  and aerobic  
reactor  were  measurement  by ADMI . ADMI  color  
was determined  with a spectrophotometer  (DR 
5000  uv-vis spectrophotometer ) in accordance  
with the ADMI  trestmulus  method  2120D  
detailed  in standard  methods  (Lenore  et al., 
2005 ). The ADMI  color  values  were  calculated  
with a computer  program  developed  by Mr. 
Jako (national  Sun Yat –Sun University , Taiwan ) 
(Kao et al., 2001 ). The spectrophotometer  was calibrated  before  each use with standard  platinum  
cobalt  color  solution  of 50, 100, 200, 250 and 
500 ADMI  color  units  (Lenore  et al., 2005 ). 
Also  results  were  measured  at a wavelength  of 
534 nm in which  maximum  absorbance  was 
obtained  in UV-vis spectrophotometer . The 
samples  were  centrifuged  at 4000rpm  for 5min  
and the supernatant  liquor  was filtered  through  
glass  –fiber  filters  (0.45 µm). The samples  were  
diluted  1 in 5 with distilled  water  and then the 
absorbance  value  of supernatants  was determined  
(Bell and Buckley , 2003 ).
Operating  conditions
Fifty  days after the start up period , approximately  
50% COD  removal  efficiency  was obtained . COD  
concentration  increased  from  1000  to 5000  mg/L 
per day during  the next 51days . The ABR  reactor  
was brought  into operation  with 30mg /L reactive  
Red 2 dye. Value  of the operating  parameters  for 
150 days of operation  is summarized  in Table  
1. Organic  loading  was increased  from  1 to 5 
KgCOD /m³ per day following  the 50 days of 
start up period . The ABR  reactor  was operated  
at loading  rate between  4-5 KgCOD /m³ per day 
between  days 50 and 150, while  HRT  decreased  
from  4 days to 1 day in ABR  reactor  following  
the 50 days of start up period

70Color  removal
Fig.4 and Table  1 show  the color  reduction  over 
time. These  results  show  efficient  decolorization  
of the CI reactive  Red 2 waste  stream . The color  
reduction  averaged  87 % with 100 mg/L dye 
concentration  in the feed and 85 % for the 250 
mg/L concentration . The color  removal  dropped  
to 65 % when  the dye concentration  was increased  
to 350 mg/L (day=127). This was the lowest  color  
removal  achieved  throughout  the duration  of the 
test, then increased  to 80 % in one HRT. Fig.5 
shows  the average  color  removal  percentage  in 
different  ABR  compartments  at different  time

DISCUSSION
The profiles  (Fig.2) show  that the majority  of the 
COD  was reduced  in the first three  compartments  
of the reactor . The profiles  also show  very little 
COD  reduction  in the last two compartments  of 
the reactor ; this was substantiated  by the biogas  
results  and the population  characterization  
experiments . The COD  removal  during  start up, 
or before  the addition  of the dye to the feed stream  
was maximum  60% on day 50. CI reactive  Red 2 
was added  to the feed stream  at a concentration  of 
30mg /L on day 50. This resulted  in a slight  decrease  
in the COD  reduction  with removal  efficiency  
of 54%. The COD  reduction  stabilized  within  
9 HRT  to give an effluent  COD  concentration  
of 1170  mg/L. The average  COD  reduction  
for the complex  feed containing  100 mg/L dye 
concentration  was 62%. This average  was 51% 
for the 250 mg/L concentration  and 58% for the 
350 mg/L concentration  dye. Thus , there  was a 
slight  decrease  in the COD  removal  efficiency  
with each increase  in the dye concentration . 
This showed  low metabolic  activity  in these  
compartments . The concentration  of CI reactive  
Red 2 in the Influent  increased  periodically  after 
at least 20 hydraulic  retention  times  (HRT  =24 h) 
and when  more  than 90% removal  of the dye had 
been  achieved .
In a study  performed  by, Bell and Buckley (2003 ), 
ABR  reactors  have  been  used in laboratory  for 
removing  a mixture  of food-based  colors , which  
correlates  with the results  of this study .  
Bell and Buckley  obtained  86% decolorization  
efficiency  in an 8-compartment  anaerobic  baffled  
reactor  at an organic  loading  of 4g COD /L using  
sucrose  as carbon  source . It was observed  that 
250 mg/L of reactive  Red 141 was degraded  with 
a COD  efficiency  removal  of 90% in 24 hours , in anaerobic  reactor (Bell and Buckley , 2003 ) The 
reason  for the greater  COD  removal  in current  
research  can be attributed  to the larger  number  of 
compartments  in reactor . 
In a research  by Kong  and Wu, an ABR  reactor  
was used in laboratory  system  for measuring  
the removal  of textile  dye with HRT  in 8 h. The 
findings  showed  58% COD  removal  efficiency  
and also 85% color  removal  at a temperature  of 
30˚C (Kong  and Wu, 2008 ). It is worth  mentioning  
that in FAS reactor  more  COD  removal  efficiency  
was observed  because  this reactor  was aerobic . 
The COD  removal  efficiencies  were  40–60%  
at organic  loading  rates  of 1–5 kg/m³ per day. 
About  100 mg/L reactive  Red 2 and 3000  mg/L 
of glucose –COD  containing  wastewater  was 
treated  with a maximum  COD  removal  efficiency  
of 96% and the effluent  COD  was reduced  to 120 
mg /L in the combined  system .
Color  removal  was efficient  with an average  
color  removal  of 86 % over the whole  test period . 
The minimum  dye concentration  achieved  in the 
effluent  was 5 mg/L, on day 91; however , this 
concentration  is still significant  since  color  is 
visible  at concentrations  < 1 mg/L. The effluent  
would  require  further  treatment  before  discharge  
to a water  source . If this color  reduction  was 
achieved  by pretreatment  at the factory , further  
aerobic  reduction  of the aromatic  amines  
could  be achieved  by conventional  treatment  
at a wastewater  treatment  works . As for FAS 
reactor  the color  removal  would  not happen  and 
sometimes  an increase  of color  would  even  be 
seen due to the autoxidation  process .
In comparison  to research  done  by Bill and 
Buckley  in which  the food and CI reactive  
Red 141 color  removal  efficiencies  were  86% Fig.6: pH profiles in ABR reactorA. Naimabadi, et al., DECOLORIZATION AND BIOLOGICAL...
72on average , in this research  a greater  amount  
of reactive  Red2  color  was removed . But in 
comparison  with research  by Sponza  (96%) the 
efficiency  of color  removal  was less. That is due 
to the combination  of systems  used by Sponza  
(Sponza  and Isik, 2005 ).
 These  data show  that changes  in the dye 
concentration  had a slight  effect  on the reactor  
pH and also illustrate  the horizontal  separation  
of acid genesis  and methanogenesis  through  the 
ABR  (Bell and Buckley , 2002 ; Ujang  and Henze , 
2004 ). 
The findings  have  shown  that the increase  of 
color  has no influence  on the process  activity  of 
these  bacteria  during  acid production . Also  results  
pointed  out the fact that an increase  of reactive  
Red2  concentration  dye in effluent  wastewater  
has less influence  on different  pH compartments  
of the reactor . The obtained  results  in color  
removal  with the use of ABR  reactor  have  shown  
that the methane  bacteria  are more  sensitive  than 
acidgenes  bacteria .    
The findings  of this study  have  shown  that 
the sequential  anaerobic /aerobic  system  was 
efficient  in the degradation  of azo dye reactive  
Red 2. In this experiment  with partially  digested  
sludge  cultures  and with glucose  as cosubstrate , 
reactive  Red 2 dyestuff  was almost  decolorized  
under  anaerobic  conditions . Up to 90% of the 
color  of the azo dyestuff  was removed  in the 
anaerobic  stage . The released  intermediates  
were  mineralized  in the aerobic  part of the two 
stage  system . It was observed  that 85–95%  of 
the remaining  COD  was removed  in the aerobic  
stage . No color  removal  occurred  aerobically . The 
use of a digested  sludge  containing  ABR  reactor  
has proven  the capability  of resistance  to shock  
organic  loading . The addition  of ABR  reactor  
systems  prior  to conventional  activated  sludge  
systems , which  are in use in many  industries  in 
Iran, will result  in 90% color  removal  efficiency , 
particularly  in textile  and dye industries .
