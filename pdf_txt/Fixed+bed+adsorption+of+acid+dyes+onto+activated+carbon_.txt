Abstract —This work involves the treatment of simulated industrial waste water containing acid dye-
stu/C128s with granular activated carbon adsorption selected as the treatment method. Predicting the rateat which adsorption takes place for a given system is probably the single most important factor foradsorber design, with adsorbate residence time and ultimately the reactor dimensions controlled by thesystem’s kinetics. A ﬁxed volume stirred tank reactor was used to study the kinetics of adsorption in asingle component system. Process parameters including the rate of agitation, dye concentration and
phase ratio were studied with results being modelled using a dual resistance external mass transfer and
solid di/C128usivity model. A single value of solid di/C128usivity described the adsorption decay curves in mostinstances and also indicated that chemisorption is the likely process of acid dye adsorption onto acti-vated carbon. #1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

In this study into the kinetics of adsorption, the
granular activated carbon Filtrasorb 400
(Chemviron Carbon) was used as the adsorbent and
acid dyestu/C128 Tectilon Red 2B (Ciba-Geigy) as the
adsorbate. Granular activated carbon ensured rapid
adsorption and the dye concentrations can be calcu-lated using spectrophotometry.
Resistance to mass transfer in adsorption pro-
cesses can be described by two processes; resistance
due to external mass transfer though the particleboundary layer and resistance due to intraparticle
di/C128usion. Furusawa and Smith (1973) proposed a
model to describe external mass transfer by two
methods, using linear and non-linear isotherms,
these models were successfully applied to the
adsorption of dyestu/C128s by McKay (1983). A simple
model proposed by Spahn and Schlunder (1975a,b)
was also used to model the acid dye-carbon system
by Walker (1995).
The description of batch adsorption processes by
two resistance models including external mass trans-
fer and intraparticle di/C128usional resistance has been
developed by several authors. The major di/C128erences
in the models are due to the mechanism of intrapar-
ticle di/C128usion proposed, namely pore di/C128usion,
solid di/C128usion or a combination of both. The ﬁlm
pore di/C128usion models are based on the unreacted
shrinking core model proposed by Levenspeil (1962)
and use analytical expressions to describe di/C128usionin terms of the e/C128ective di/C128usion coecient, D
e/C128.A
graphical di/C128erentiation solution to the model was
proposed by Spahn and Schlunder (1975a,b) withWat. Res. Vol. 33, No. 8, pp. 1895–1899, 1999

using the constraint of a saturated isotherm.
Solid phase di/C128usion is the dominant e/C128ect in
intraparticle mass transfer therefore solid di/C128usionmodels have been developed by many authors. The
ﬁlm homogeneous solid di/C128usion model developed
by Matthews and Weber (1977) from measurementsof phenol removal by activated carbon, assumes
external mass transfer dominance in the initial
stages of adsorption. Al-Duri (1988) successfullyemployed the model to describe dye adsorption and
multicomponent systems. Gilliland et al. (1974)
reported the strong concentration dependence of D
s
and attributed this phenomenon to changes in ener-
gies of adsorption with surface coverage. Peel et al.
(1981) developed the ‘‘branched pore kinetic
model’’ for activated carbon adsorption in whichthe carbon particles were considered to be bi-porous
with pore di/C128usion dominating in the macropores
and solid di/C128usion occurring in the micropores. Thebranched pore model has been successfully used by
Al-Duri et al. (1990) for dye adsorption.
MATHEMATICAL MODEL
This model is based on studies carried out by
Matthews and Weber (1977) who proposed a dual
resistance model combining external mass transferand solid phase di/C128usion for batch studies whichwas later modiﬁed by McKay et al. (1983). They
assumed the adsorbent particles to be identical
spheres of radius, R, with the concentration of the
solute in the particle at distance, r, from the centre
and time, t, given by q
i(r,t), assuming spherical
geometry. The rate of change of qiwith distanceand time is given by the di/C128usional equation

It is assumed that the di/C128usional coecient, D,i n
equation 1 is constant and that the ﬁrst boundary
condition represents the state of the particle att= 0 and the second shows that the concentration
at the surface of the particle varies with time.
The model uses the isotherm described by
Redlich and Peterson (1956) and describes the mass
transfer of the solute from the liquid phase to the
particle by:

equations 1–7 can be solved by the introduction of
dimensionless variables which are described by
McKay et al. (1983) and with the solution of this
model calculated by numerical analysis. Thus theconcentration time proﬁle for a batch adsorption
may be calculated and compared with experimental
results.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Contact time experiments provided the kinetic data in
the form of concentration decay vs time curves. The gradi-ents of such curves were interpolated to give useful designparameters such as external and internal mass transfercoecients. In the contact time experimental runs a ﬁxed
mass of carbon, of known particle size, was brought into
contact with a ﬁxed volume of solution (1.7 l 11700 g) at
a preﬁxed initial dye concentration and agitation rate. Thedye solution comprised of liquid dyestu/C128s as supplied bythe manufacturer and de-ionised water. A schematic dia-gram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 with dimensions
in Table 1. At the instant of sorbate–sorbent contact, mix-
ing at a ﬁxed rate of agitation was started. Samples (2 ml)were taken from the solution at regular time intervals overa 4 h period. This small sample volume ensures that thereactor volume remains essentially constant throughoutthe course of the experiment. The samples were then ana-lysed in a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer at a wave-
length of 503 nm and the dye concentration thencalculated from a calibration curve. Process variables
under investigation included mass of adsorbent to volume
of solution ratio, agitation rate and concentration of theadsorbate in the liquid phase.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This modiﬁed model was used to describe the
kinetic decay curves for Tectilon Red (TR2B)
adsorbing onto granular activated carbon F400under a range of conditions. The results from the
model were expressed in terms of a plot of exper-
imental and modelled dimensionless solute concen-tration vs time and in terms of external masstransfer coecient, k
f, and a solid di/C128usivity, Ds,
for each particular system.
The shape of this decay curve is governed by the
external mass transfer coecient, kf, and the solid
di/C128usivity, Dswith the equilibrium of the system
described by the Redlich–Peterson isotherm. Thismodel has proved successful in a range of adsorp-
tion systems including, acid dyes adsorbing onto
peat by Allen et al. (1988), basic dyes adsorbing
onto activated carbon by Al-Duri (1988) and basic
dyes adsorbing onto peat and lignite by Murray
(1995).
The performance of this model is illustrated in
Figs 2–4 which show experimental and theoretical
decay curves at various conditions. Using a con-
stant value of D
s, the model displays a very good ﬁt
over the course of most of the experiments although
there is a slight deviation in some of the initial
stages due to under-estimation of the external masstransfer coecient.Table 1. Adsorber speciﬁcations

tion = 500 rpm.Kinetics of acid dye adsorption on GAC 1897The rate of intraparticle di/C128usion is determined
by the solid di/C128usivity, Ds, which when increased,
increases the rate of adsorption. The rate of adsorp-
tion and the magnitude of Dsare dependent upon
the nature of the adsorption process, for physisorp-tion processes the magnitude of D
sranges from
10ÿ2–10ÿ5(cm2/s) and for chemisorption systems
10ÿ5–10ÿ13(cm2/s). This may be explained by the
stronger bonds holding the molecules tighter to the
adsorbent pore walls thus lowering the rate of mol-ecular migration. D
sremains constant for variation
in adsorbent mass and agitation speed as predictedby theory, see Table 2.However, D
sdid vary slightly with change in in-
itial dye concentration. Di/C128usivity should be inde-
pendent of bulk solute concentration for the solid
di/C128usion model, however Miyahara and Okazaki(1992) reported an increase in solid di/C128usivity withconcentration during the adsorption of nitrobenzeneonto activated carbon. Our results indicate thatthere is a slight decrease in di/C128usivity with increased
dye concentration for Tectilon Red. This phenom-
enon may be due to collisions between dye mol-ecules at high concentrations increasing thedi/C128usional resistance within the particle. The trendmay be due to dye agglomeration at high bulk

the di/C128usional resistance. Dye agglomeration may
also cause blockage of the smaller pores within thecarbon structure.
Initial values of k
fused in this model were related
to values obtained from the single resistance modelsby Walker et al. (1995). However the magnitude of
the external mass transfer coecient needed to be
increased by around 40%. A more accurate ap-proximation for k
fusing single resistance models
would take the form of a linearisation of the ﬁrst
10 min rather than the ﬁrst 20 min of the Ct/C0vs
time curve. External mass transfer coecients deter-mined using single resistance models in this work
gave reasonable approximations for k
fcompared to
Murray (1995).
CONCLUSIONS
The rate at which acid dye adsorption occurs was
found to be dependent upon several process par-
ameters. Concentration decay curves were modelled
e/C128ectively by the dual resistance modiﬁedMatthews–Weber model. Constant values for the
external mass transfer coecient and solid di/C128usiv-
ity successfully described adsorption with variationin adsorbent mass. Results of external mass transferfor variation in agitation rate correlated well with
other authors with a single solid di/C128usivity describ-
ing adsorption. In order to obtain best ﬁt of exper-imental and theoretical data, a decrease in solid
di/C128usivity was needed for decrease in solute concen-
tration. The value of solid di/C128usivity also indicatedthat chemisorption is the likely process of acid dye
adsorption onto activated carbon.Acknowledgements —This work was funded by the
