ABSTRACT   
Microorganisms have been exploited for the treatment of waste water and bioremediation of environmental 
pollutants.  The present research work deals with the decolorization and degradation of harmful textile dye Orange 
F2R by using bacteria isolated from acclimatized  samples. All the promising isolates were studied for decolorization 
of dye by optimizing various cultural conditions. It was observed that the org anisms were able to completely 
decolorize the dye (98.99 %) at 300C to 370C temperature and pH 7.0. The effect of Inoculum size and dye 
concentration was also studied. Effect of various Carbon and Nitrogen studies revealed that these promising 
isolates were  able to decolorize highest amount of dye in presence of Glucose and Yeast Extract.

1. INTRODUCTION:  
Near about 10000 different types of dyes are used in 
textile industries and near about 280000 tons of dyes 
are discharged without ant treatment into the 
environment and water resource s due to inefficient 
processing (Hsueh et al., 2005).  These dyes are 
recalcitrant in nature hence persist in environment for 
longer period of time. Most of them are Azo dyes. Azo 
dyes contain  N=N in their structure. Due to this bond 
Azo dyes are not easily biodegradable (Minussi et 
al.,2001; Gharbani et al., 2008 ). These dyes form major 
constituents in all dyes of about 60% -70% . Out of which 
2-50% of dyes get loose due to inefficient process and 
disposed along with waste water  (Olukanni et al., 2009).  
These dyes affects badly on photosynthetic efficiency of 
aquatic plants by decreasing penetration of sunlight and 
produces deep coloration of water ( Mester et al., 2000; 
Duran et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011 ). If these dyes are 
treated properly they remain in environment for longer 
period of time (Olukanni et al., 2006 ). These dyes can be 
treated by physical or chemical methods but due to some limitations with these methods they cannot be 
applied for treatment of textile waste water  (Chen et 
al.,2003).  Now a day’s  biological methods by using 
microorganisms are in great dem and as these methods 
are cost effective, ecofriendly, easy and requires less 
experimental setup ( Mossavi et al., 2005 ). Varieties  of 
microbes are  having ability to decolorize textile dyes viz. 
Actinomycetes, Fungi, Bacteria and Yeasts (Olukanni et 
al.,2006).  These microorganisms decolorize and 
degrade the dyes enzymatically (Pandey et al., 2007) . 
Various factors and cultural conditions are responsible 
for dye decolorization activity. Recently the dye 
decolorization by using various potential 
microorganisms has been increased great attention. 
Various species of bacteria are exploited either in single 
species or as consortia for bioremediation of textile dyes 
(Verma et al., 2003; Mossvi et al.,2007).  
The present research has been undertaken for 
bioremediation of harmful textile azo dye Orange F2R 
by using promising bacterial isolates. The optimization

67 of various cultural conditions was carried out for 
maximum decolorization of dye.  
 
2. MATERIALS  AND METHODS:  
2.1. Dye:  Azo dye Orange F2R (λ max - 494 nm).  
2.2. Collection and Acclimatization of samples:  
The soil and water samples were collected from waste 
disposal site around textile industries, ETP, compost and 
manure. These samples were collected in sterile  
polythene bag and bo ttle and brought to laboratory.  
The samples were further mixed and homogenized 
properly and acclimatized by increasing concentration 
of dye Orange F2R upto one month. These acclimatized 
samples were then used for isolation of bacteria .  
2.3. Isolation and screening of dye decolorizing 
bacteria:  
By using serial dilution of acclimatized samples, the 
isolation of bac terial species was carried out on nutrient 
agar. The isolated and well grown bacterial coloni es 
were used for further study.  
The screening of dye decolorizing bacteria was carried 
by using nutrient agar having 100 ppm concentration of 
dye. Each of bacterial isolate was tested against Orange 
F2R. After incubation period plates were observed for 
zone of decolorization. Those bacteria l isolates showing 
maximum zone of decolorization were selected for 
further studies.  
2.4. Optimization of various cultural conditions:  
2.4.1.  Effect of Temperature, pH, Inoculum size, Dye 
concentration:  
To achieve maximum dye decolorization the 
optimization of various cultural conditions was carried 
out. To study the effect of Temperature, the tubes 
containing 30 ml nutrient broth and 100 ppm dye 
concentration were inoculated with promising isolates. 
The tubes were kept for incubation at various 
temperatures viz. Room temperature, 370C, 450C, 550C 
and 650C.The effect of pH was studied by using 30 ml 
nutrient broth with 100 ppm dye concentration. The pH 
of medium was adjusted at the range 6.0 -8.0. Then the 
tubes were inoculated with promising isolates and kept 
for incubation. Similarly,  the effect of inoculum size was 
studied by inoculating promising isolates in various 
volumes viz. 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% in 30 ml nutrient broth 
having 100 ppm dye concen tration.  In order to check 
the efficiency of isolates for dye decolorization the 
tubes with 30 ml nutrient broth were added with 
various concentration of Orange F2R in the range 100 ppm to 1000 ppm. Further the tubes were inoculated 
with promising isolates  and kept for incubation. After 
incubation period the tubes were observed for dye 
decolorization spectrophotometrically.  
2.5. Effect of Carbon and Nitrogen sources:  
The isolates were examined for dye decolorization 
ability  in presence of various carbon and nitr ogen 
source. 30 ml Minimal medium containing 100 ppm dye 
concentration was added with different Carbon sources 
(Glucose, Sucrose and Starch) and Nitrogen source 
(Peptone, Yeast extract and Meat extract) . Tubes were 
inoculated with promising i solates and ke pt for 
incubation for 24 hours.  After incubation tubes were 
observed for decolorization. Decolorization was 
monitored by spectrophotometer.  
2.6. Percent decolorization study:  
The determination of percent dye decolorization  was 
carried out at ƛ max  by spectrophotometer (Systronics -
106 model) and calculated by using following formula.  
 
% Decolorization= [(A0 -A1)/A0] × 100  
Where, A0 = Initial absorbance ; A1 = Final absorbance    
 
3. RESULTS:  
3.1. Isolation and screening of dye decolorizing 
bacteria:  
Total 12 isolates were isolated. These isolates were 
further screened for dye decolorization ability. Among 
12 isolates total 5 isolates were having highest efficiency 
for decolorization of Orange F2R within 24 hours. Hence 
these 5 promising isolates were used f or further used 
study.  
3.2. Optimization of various cultural conditions:  
3.2.1.  Effect of Temperature, pH, Inoculum size, Dye 
concentration:  
The promising isolates exhibited  complete 
decolorization of Orange F2R  at temperature 370C. 
These isolates showed higher decolorization of dye at 
pH range 6.0 -8.0. Specifically,  it was found that the pH 
7.0 was optimum pH. The isolates exhibited  maximum 
decolorization when in oculated with 1 % inoculums size. 
Further it was observed that these iso lates were  able to 
decolorize dye Orange F2R up to  1000ppm 
concentration. However,  the maximum activ ity of 
isolate s was observed at 8 00ppm of dye concentration. 
Above 8 00ppm concentration the activity was slightly 
decreased, which was calculated b y spectrophotometer 
at ƛ max 494  nm. The results are shown in Fig. 1

4. DISCUSSION:  
The present research work reveals the efficiency of 5 
promising isolates which were isolated from 
acclimatized samples.  These 5 isolates were designated 
as OFR -1, OFR -2, OFR -3, OFR-4 and OFR -5. The optimum 
temperature was 370C which showed near about 
complete decolorization of dye ( 98.99 %) at 24 hours. 
This could be  because optimum cultural conditions and 
maximum enzyme production by the bacteria. These 
results were exactly similar with Bhatt et al. (2012) and 
Saratale et al. (2010 ). They revealed that 370C is 
optimum temperature for dye decolorization by 
bacterial consortium. The efficiency of isolates for dye 
decolorization was gradually decreased above 450C and 
this could be due to  decrease in cell growth and  enzyme 
activity (Cetin et al., 2006; Panswad et al., 2000 ). The pH 
is also important factor for activity of dye decolorization 
of bacteria. Generally,  the pH in the range 6.0 to 10.0 is 
optimum for maximum decolorization of textile dyes 
(Chen et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2007; Kilic et al., 2007 ). 
In this research work the pH 7.0 was optimum pH for 
highest decolorization (96.31%) of dye. These results 
exactly in accordance with Kannan et al . (2013) who 
suggested that Pseudomonas putida was able decolorize 
dye Ramazol Bl ack B at 7.0 pH upto 93.23% in 48 hours.  The organisms utilize textile dyes as their Carbon source 
but upto certain limit. Above that limit the increasing 
concentration of dye re duce the ability of organisms due 
to toxic nature of dye.  In present research work the 
organisms could decolorize Orange F2R upto 800 ppm 
concentration above that the decolorization efficiency 
of isol ates reduced. This was earlier proved by 
Gopinath et al.  (2009) that Bacillus sp. isolated from 
tannery industrial e ffluent was able to decolorize Congo 
red dye at initial concentrations but the higher 
concentrations of dye inhibits the bacteria.  The present 
research work exhibited that Glucose and Yeast extract 
were best carbon and nitrogen sources for maximum 
decolori zation of dye . These results were strongly in 
accordance with Jagwani et al., (2003) who suggested 
that decolorization of ROM2R (100 ppm) was maximum 
in presence of 1% Glucose and Yeast extract by six 
bacterial isolates namely VCS, NAS, SAS, VSS, VWS and 
SWS.  
 
5. CONCLUSION:  
From the present study it can be concluded that 5 
promising b acterial isolates could be exploited for 
bioremediation of textile azo dye Orange F2R which is a Temp-37 pH 7.0 I.S.- 1% D.C. - 800 Carbon- GNitrogen-
