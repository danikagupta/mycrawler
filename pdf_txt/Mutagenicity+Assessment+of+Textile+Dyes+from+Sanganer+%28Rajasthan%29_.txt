Abstract: Sanganer town, district Jaipur (Rajasthan, India) i s famous worldwide for its hand block dyeing and te xtile printing industries. These industries 
use a variety of chemicals and dyes during processi ng and finishing of raw materials Most of the texti le dyes used by these industries have not been 
evaluated for their impact on health and the enviro nment. The workers in these industries are exposed to such dyes with no control over the length and 
frequency of exposure. Further, untreated and somet imes even treated effluents from these industries a re released into surface waters of Amani Shah 
drainage or through the drainage systems, seep into  the ground water and adjoining water bodies. Since  many textile dyes are known carcinogens and 
mutagens, a complete evaluation of the safety of th ese dyes in the human environment must include an e valuation of their genotoxicity or mutagenicity. 
A total of 12 textile dyes from Sanganer were teste d for their mutagenicity, by Ames Salmonella revers ion assay using strain TA 100 of Salmonella 
typhimurium.. Only 1 dye, Red 12 B showed absence o f mutagenic activity. The remaining 11 dyes were al l positively mutagenic. 
Key words: Textile dyes, Mutagenicity, Ames test 
Introduction 
Dye production in India is estimated to be around 
64,000 tonnes, which is about 6.6% of the world pro duction. There 
are around 700 varieties of dyes and dye intermedia tes produced 
in India, mainly direct dyes, acid dyes, reactive d yes and 
pigments. Most of these dyes have not been characte rized 
regarding their chemical nature, purity, possible t oxicity or their 
impact on health and the environment. Yet, they are  widely used 
by textile, leather, paint and even the food indust ry. The textile 
industry in India alone consumes up to 80% of the t otal dyestuffs 
produced. 
In Rajasthan state particularly, textile mills repr esent 
an important economic sector. Sanganer is famous fo r dyeing 
and printing of colorful dresses, bed sheets, curta ins, dress 
material and variety of other textiles. Bulk of the  textile products 
of these industries is exported. It is located abou t 15 km south of 
Jaipur, the State capital that has a population of more than two 
million people. The total area of Sanganer is about  635.5 Sq. km 
out of which, 12.9 Sq. km comprises the urban area.  Most of the 
textile industries of Sanganer are concentrated in this urban area. 
There are estimated to be around 500 block and scre enprinting 
units in Sanganer. 
Of all dyes produced across the world, 11% goes out
as effluents, 2% from manufacturing and as much as 9% from 
coloring. The effluents from dyeing and textile ind ustries contain 
chemicals with intense colors and the release of th ese effluents 
to receiving streams may be objectionable for vario us aesthetic 
reasons. Besides a number of dyes used by these tex tile

contain compounds that are difficult to treat biolo gically due to 
their resistance against biodegradation. The dye ef fluents may 
contain some components or moieties that could be t oxic, 
carcinogenic or mutagenic to aquatic life (Suzuki et al., 2001). 
Central Pollution Control Board has listed the dye and dye 
intermediates industry as one of the heavily pollut ing industries 
(CPCB, 1990). They are thus, a potent hazard to the  natural
sources like soil, water, flora, fauna, livestock a nd human 
population. 
Ecological and toxicological problems due to the 
discharge of wastewaters from Sanganer textile indu stries in local
drainage (Amani Shah Ka Nallah) have been one of th e most 
important water pollution problems in this area. St udies have 
clearly indicated that the industrial effluents, wh ich are directly 
discharged into the Amani Shah Ka Nallah, drainage contain 
highly mutagenic compounds. These compounds are als o 
contaminating the surface and even underground wate r, thereby, 
making it unfit for irrigation and drinking (Mathur  et al.,  2005). 
High concentrations of heavy metals like Cu, Cd, Zn , Pb, Ni, etc. 
have also been reported in this area (Khan, 1995). 
Dyes and heavy metals have been considered to be 
the possible source of genotoxic activity in dyeing  and textile 
effluents. Several dyes have been investigated and found to be 
carcinogenic (Prival et al., 1984). Since large quantities of dyes 
are used, such pollution due to dyes may occur on a  significant 
scale. Assessment of genotoxicity of dyes is theref ore of utmost 
importance. Most of the dyes, being openly sold in Sanganer Journal of Environmental Biology January 2007,  28(1) 123-126 (2007)

markets have no information regarding their chemica l nature, 
purity or possible mutagenicity or toxicity. This s tudy was thus 
planned to investigate the mutagenic potential of t he dyes 
available in markets of Sanganer. 
Materials and Methods 
Collection of samples: Dyes (12) were obtained at random basis 
from local Sanganer market. They had no information  regarding 
chemical constituents, purity or hazardous nature. Dye solutions 
were made by dissolving 1 g dry powder of dye in 10 0 ml of 
warm, sterile, distilled water. All the dyes used w ere water soluble. 
Five concentrations (2 µl, 5 µl, 10 µl, 50 µl and 1 00 µl) of these 
dyes were tested 
Ames mutagenicity test: The Salmonella  reversion assay was 
conducted using the plate incorporation procedure d escribed by 
Ames et al.  (1975) and revised by Maron and Ames (1983). The 
dye samples were tested with TA 100 strain of S. typhimurium ,
which was obtained from microbial type culture coll ection and 
Gene Bank (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology  (IMTech), 
Chandigarh (India). 
Samples were tested on duplicate plates in two 
independent experiments. Five dose levels of indivi dual samples 
were tested. Positive control used for TA 100 was s odium azide 
(CAS Number: 26628-22-8): 5 µg / plate: 2969 revert ants. Sterile 
distilled water was used as negative control. Fresh  solutions of 
the reference mutagen were prepared immediately bef ore the 
beginning of each experiment. The revertant colonie s were clearly 
visible in a uniform background lawn of auxotrophic  bacteria. The 
tester strain was maintained and stored according t o the standard 
methods (Mortelmans and Zeiger, 2000). The strain w as regularly 
checked for genetic markers. All reagents used were  of analytical
grade, supplied by Himedia Laboratories Limited (In dia) and 
Sigma Aldrich. 
Data analysis: The most common method of evaluation of data 
from the Salmonella  assay is the “two fold rule” according to 
which doubling of spontaneous reversion rate at one  or two 
test chemical concentrations constitutes a positive  response 
(Cariello, 1996; Mortelmans and Zeiger, 2000). This  rule 
specifies that if a test compound doubles or more t han doubles, 
the mean spontaneous mutation frequency obtained on  the day 
of testing, then the compound is considered signifi cantly 
mutagenic. Using this procedure the following crite ria were used 
to interpret results. 
Positive :  A compound is considered a mutagen if it produce s a 
reproducible, dose related increase in the number o f revertant 
colonies in one or more strains of Salmonella typhimurium . A 
compound is considered a weak mutagen if it produce s a 
reproducible dose related increase in the number of  revertant 
colonies in one or more strains but the number of r evertants is 
not double the background number of colonies. Negative :  A compound is considered a nonmutagen if no dose
related increase in the number of revertant colonie s is observed 
in at least two independent experiments. 
Inconclusive:   If a compound cannot be identified clearly as a 
mutagen or a nonmutagen, the results are classified  as 
inconclusive (e.g. if there is one elevated count).
For this analysis the dose related increase in the 
number of revertant colonies were observed for the test 
compounds and mutagenicity ratios were calculated. Mutagenicity 
ratio is the ratio of average induced revertants on  test plates 
(spontaneous revertants plus induced revertants) to  average 
spontaneous revertants on negative control plates ( spontaneous 
revertants). Mutagenicity ratio of 2.0 or more is r egarded as a 
significant indication of mutagenicity. 
Results and Discussion 
Many of the dyes used by textile industries are kno wn 
carcinogens (ICPEMC i.e.  International Commission for 
Protection against Environmental Mutagens and 
Carcinogens,1982) and teratogens (Beck, 1983). Yosh ida and 
Miyakawa (1973) reported that occupational exposure  to 
benzidine dyes might have possibly resulted in blad der cancer 
amongst kimono painters in Japan. Triple primary ca ncers 
involving kidney, urinary bladder and liver in a dy e worker have 
also been reported (Morikawa et al., 1997).

Dyes are introduced into the environment through 
industrial effluents of these industries. Excessive  and 
indiscriminate use of dyestuffs has thus become inc reasingly a 
subject of concern. Therefore a complete evaluation  of the safety 
of these dyes in the human environment must include  an 
evaluation of their genotoxicity or mutagenicity. A  total of 12 dyes 
were tested for mutagenicity, using strain TA 100 o f Salmonella 
typhimurium .124 Journal of Environmental Biology   /circleshadowdwnJanuary, 2007 /circleshadowdwnMutagenicity assessment of textile dyes 
The mutagenicity ratios of the dyes are shown in Ta ble 
1. As observed from the Table, only 1 dye Red 12 B had 
mutagenicity ratio of less than 2.0, showing absenc e of 
mutagenicity. The remaining 11 dyes were all positi vely mutagenic 
with mutagenicity ratios of more than 2.0. 
Amongst the eleven dyes tested in the present study , 
navy blue and turqish blue had lesser mutagenic act ivity (1000- 
1200 induced revertants, per 100 µl of dye) (Fig. 1 ). The dose 
response curves of 3 dyes i.e. grey, solar brown an d golden top, 
are shown in Fig. 2. Compared to the previously men tioned dyes 
(navy blue and turqish blue), this group of dyes (g rey, solar brown 
and golden top) showed higher number of revertants,  of the order, 
3000-10000 induced revertants, per 100µl of dye sol ution. 
However, the strongest mutagenic activity was seen with black 
and parrot green (4000-20,000 induced revertants, p er 100µl of 
dye) (Fig. 2). Fig. 1: Dose response curve of dyes with strain TA 100

These observations are in accordance with several
studies that report mutagenicity of a number of dye s like direct 
black 38, acid red 26, etc. (Garner and Nutman, 197 7; Venturini
and Tamaro, 1979). Unlimited and uncontrolled use o f such dyes 
can lead to grave consequences in terms of human he alth and 
ecological balance. 
The presence of impurities in the commercially 
available dyes has been reported to contribute to t he mutagenicity 
of these dyes (Prival et al. , 1984). As the dyes under investigation 
were not purified, the impurities present in them c ould have also 
been responsible for the high mutagenic activity of  the dyes. 
Nevertheless, the fact still remains that highly mu tagenic 
compounds are being used in textile dyeing and prin ting industries 
of Sanganer. 
Further, four of the tested dyes i.e. sky blue, kha ki, 
lemon top and moongia green were so toxic that they  inhibited 
the growth of bacteria, at higher dose levels. The results of this 
study clearly indicate that most of the locally use d dyes are highly 
mutagenic, and therefore should be used with great caution. 
Since innumerable dyes are available in local marke ts, 
chemical analysis of each and every dye is not poss ible because 
of the time and cost involved. However, Ames test c an easily 
and quickly assess mutagenic potential of these dye s. Besides, 
the dyes can be compared on the basis of their muta genic 
potencies. Thus, this assay should be used as a reg ular 
monitoring tool for assessing the dyes. 
Results from genetic bioassays are relevant to huma n 
health because the toxicological target is DNA, whi ch exists in 
all cellular life forms. Thus, it can be extrapolat ed that compounds 
shown to be reactive with DNA in one species have t he potential
to produce similar effects in other species. Fig. 3:  Dose response curve of dyes with strain TA 100

deleterious to the organisms and can lead to severe  and 
irreversible health consequences. 
Therefore, indiscriminate use of synthetic chemical
dyes should be restricted or the workers while hand ling these 
dyes should at least take proper precautions. They should be 
replaced by vegetable dyes, which are ecofriendly. Besides, 
before using the dyes at large scale, their mutagen ic potential
should be assessed by biological assays like Ames t est. This 
bioassay can be used as an initial screening test t o analyze 
various dyes and dye containing effluents, which ar e causing 
major damage to the aquatic environment.
