 Abstract  1 
Achieving mainstream short -cut nitrogen removal via nitrite has been a carbon and 2 
energy -efficient goal which wastewater engineers are dedicated to explore. This study 3 
applied a novel pilot -scale A -B-S2EBPR syst em process integrated  with sidestream 4 
enhanced biological phosphorus removal ) to achieve the nitrite accumulation and 5 
downstream anammox for treating municipal wastewater. Nitrite accumulated to 5.5 ± 6 
0.3 mg N/L in the intermittently aerated tanks of B -stage with the nitrite accumulation 7 
ratio (NAR) of 79 .1 ± 6.5%. The final effluent concentration and removal efficiency of 8 
total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) were 4 .6 ± 1.8 mg N/L and 84 .9 ± 5.6%, respectively. 9 
Batch nitrification/denitrification activity tests a nd functional gene abundance of 10 
ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) suggested 11 
that the nitrite accumulation was mostly caused by partial denitrification without NOB - 12 
selection. The unique features of S2EBPR (longer anaerob ic HRT/SRT, lower ORPs, 13 
high and more complex VFAs etc.) seemed to impact the nitrogen microbial 14 
communities: the conventional AOB kept at a very low level of 0.13 ± 0.13%  during 15 
the operation period, and the dominant candidate internal carbon -accumulating  16 
heterotrophic genera of Acinetobacter  (17.8 ± 15.5) % and Comamonadaceae  (6.7 ± 17 
3.4%) were highly enriched. Furthermore, the single -cell Raman spectroscopy -based 18 
intracellular polymer analysis revealed the dominate microorganisms that could utilize 19 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA ) as the potential internal carbon source to drive partial 20 
denitrification . This study provides insights and a new direction for implementing the 21 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction  27 
The conventional activated sludge processes are energy -intensive, consuming as 28 
much as 25 -40% of the total operational costs in a typical wastewater treatment plant 29 
(WWTP) (Ehrhard and Murphy, 2009)  and 3% of the generated electricity in the United 30 
States  (Logan and Elimelech, 2012; McCarty et al., 2011) . To transit WWTPs towards 31 
energy -neutral and resource recovery -oriented plants, the A -B processes have been 32 
developed where the A -stage is designed for carbon capture for energy recovery and B - 33 
stage is for nutrient removal and recovery (Liu et al., 2019; Rahman et al., 2020) . 34 
Since most influent carbon would be firstly captured at A -stage, B -stage is 35 
preferable to implement the short -cut nitrogen removal processes via nitrite instead of 36 
nitrate. As successfu lly demonstrated in treating ammonium -rich streams (e.g., sludge 37 
digestate, leachate and industrial wastewater), the partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) 38 
processes could save 100% carbon, 60% aeration and reduce 80% sludge production 39 
(Kartal et al., 2010; La ckner et al., 2014; Van der Star et al., 2007) . However, the 40 
realization of short -cut nitrogen removal in mainstream B -stage is still the main 41 
challenging aspect or sometimes bottleneck for municipal low -strength wastewaters, 42 
where the sustainable supply o f the intermediate nitrite could not be easily acquirable 43 
by controlling temperature, free ammonia (FA), free nitrous acid (FNA), dissolved 44 
oxygen (DO), etc. to suppress the nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) over ammonium 45 
oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (Cao et al ., 2017; Laureni et al., 2016) .  46 
Recently, partial denitrification (PDN) was proposed and demonstrated as a 47 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 practically more promising and stable alternative to achieve the mainstream nitrite 48 
shunt for the low -strength municipal wastewaters  (Du et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017) . The 49 
integration of PDN/anammox could theoretically reduce 47.7% oxygen demand, 54.2% 50 
COD requirement and 66.3% sludge production compared to the conventional 51 
nitrification /denitrification  process (Zhang et al., 2019) . To date, the t ype of carbon 52 
sources, limited ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), high pH, high salinity, and the 53 
alternating feast -famine regime were reported to be the selection pressure to achieve 54 
successful enrichment of partial denitrifying microorganisms  (Zhang et a l., 2020) . 55 
Generally, acetate or the sludge fermentation liquid was proved to be the most ideal 56 
carbon source to achieve the efficient PDN process in the lab -scale reactors than any 57 
other type (glucose, methanol, ethanol, etc.) (Cao et al., 2013; Le et al. , 2019; Li et al., 58 
2018a; Zhang et al., 2020) . The genera of Thauera  and Halomonas were respectively 59 
reported to be highly enriched in acetate -fed denitratation system by different research 60 
groups via amplicon sequencing and suspected to be the progressive  onset denitrifiers 61 
with much higher functional gene abundance and transcription of nitrate reductase than 62 
nitrite reductase (Li et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2019) . In addition, the endoge nous partial 63 
denitrification was also found driven by microorganisms c apable of transforming the 64 
external carbon source to the internal carbon storage. In a Halomonas -dominated  65 
denitratating culture, with the sufficient acetate supply (C/N=5), it was observed that 66 
the poly -β-hydroxy -butyrate ( PHB) accumulated first during th e nitrate to nitrite phase, 67 
and then consumed with the reduction of nitrite (Li et al., 2016) . However, in another 68 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 studies, acetate was firstly taken up accompanied with the glycogen consumption and 69 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA ) accumulation during the anaerobic phase in a lab -scale 70 
reactor, and then utilized to reduce nitrate to nitrite via bulk chemical analysis, resulting 71 
the enrichment of denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms  (DGAOs ) (Ji et al., 72 
2018; Zeng et al., 200 3b). Even though, most of the PDN study was still at the early 73 
stage in lab -scale and the demonstration of PDN process at pilot - or full -scale was only 74 
be reported recently by a few studies (Fofana et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021) . Pure 75 
culture studies of denitrifying bacteria implied that nitrate reductase has a more 76 
competitive advantage for electrons over nitrite reductase leading to the transient 77 
accumulation of extracellular nitrite during denitrification (Almeida et al., 1995; Glass 78 
and Silverstein, 1 998), this provide the fundamental basis to enhance the nitrite 79 
accumulation by either s ub-sufficient carbon supply or lower electron donor flux rates 80 
by internal PHA hydrolysis to favor the PDN process (Zeng et al., 2003a) . Particularly , 81 
the identities an d roles of specific organism that are capable of utilizing internal carbon 82 
(i.e., PHA) storage to facilitate the PDN process have hardly been investigated.  83 
The emerging alternative side -stream enhanced biological phosphorus removal 84 
(S2EBPR) processes utili zes the hydrolysis and partial fermentation of return activated 85 
sludge (RAS) to generate internal carbon,  and provides  influent carbon -independent, 86 
therefore more controlled, stable and favorable phosphorus accumulating organisms 87 
(PAOs)  enrichment conditio ns to enable and enhance the EBPR performance and 88 
stability (Barnard et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018; Onnis ‐Hayden et al., 2020; Srinivasan 89 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019a) . Another unique observation is that S2EBPR enriched 90 
for higher abundance of PHA -accumulating organisms than conventional EBPR 91 
systems (Wang et al., 2021) . Therefore, we hypothesized  that the incorporation of 92 
S2EBPR may potentially facilitate mainstream PDN by enriching for higher abundance 93 
of PHA -accumulating organisms than conventional BNR processes, which would favor 94 
internal carbon -driven PDN. Our team have recently reported the feasibility of 95 
combining the S2EBPR with A -B stage to achieve short -cut nitrogen removal and 96 
phosphorus  removal  (Stephanie et al., 2018) . In this study, we investigated the nitrite 97 
accumulation predominantly attributed to PDN rather than PN (NOB out -selecti on was 98 
not observed) in this pilot A -B-S2EBPR system treating municipal wastewater 99 
treatment. Process performance, carbon and nitrogen mass balance, batch activity tests 100 
were performed to investigate the nature and cause of the nitrite accumulation. 16S 101 
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR were applied to detect the microbial 102 
communities and phylogenetic abundance of conventional nitrifiers (AOB and NOB). 103 
In addition, single -cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) and hierarchical clustering 104 
analysis were conducte d to obtain the phenotypic profiling of the dominant bacteria and 105 
quantify the intracellular carbon polymers (including PHA , glycogen, polyphosphate , 106 
etc.) dynamics within the dominant operational phenotypic units  (OPUs) during the 107 
partial denitrification process. This research advances our understanding  and provides 108 
insights towards a new direction for integrating the S2EBPR to the sustainable A -B 109 
process to realize the mainstream short -cut nitrogen removal.  110 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 2. Materials and methods  111 
2.1. Pilot A -B-S2EBPR system  112 
The pilot plant operated by Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD)  is located 113 
at the Chesapeake -Elizabeth WWTP in Virginia Beach, V A, USA. The plant runs in an 114 
A-B process  consisting of the high -rate activated sludge (HRAS) process at A -stage 115 
followed by B -stage designing for achieving nitrite accumulation, and then combined 116 
with the anammox moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) polishing step to accomplish 117 
short -cut nitrogen removal (Fig. 1). The detailed parameters of A -B process have been 118 
introduced elsewher e (Klaus et al., 2020; Printz, 2019) . Briefly, the B -stage includes an 119 
anaerobic selector with a volume of 53 L, and followed by four identical continuous 120 
stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series with the total volume of 600 L. The CSTRs are 121 
intermittently aerated via Ammonia v ersus NO x (nitrite+nitrate) (AvN) control strategy 122 
(Regmi et al., 2014)  with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 h and sludge retention 123 
time (SRT)  of 8.3 ± 1.3 days . The pilot plant also includes a 340 L MBBR loaded with 124 
K3 anammox biofilm carriers (AnoxKaldnes, Sweden) and a 174 L side -stream 125 
biological phosphorus remover (SBPR) receiving part of return activated sludge (RAS) 126 
and fermentate from A -stage wasted activated sludge (WAS) fermenter to enhance the 127 
phosphorus removal.  For this study, the pilot -plant was operated  for 100 days and the 128 
detailed operational and performance parameters were summarized in Table S1.  129 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

2.2. Batch nitrification activity tests  135 
The batch nitrification activity tests were performed weekly on site. About 4 L 136 
mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) were withdrawn from the 4th aerobic tank at B - 137 
stage and pre -aerated for 30 minutes to oxidize the residue carbon, and then spiked 25 138 
mg N/L ammonium chloride, pH was maintained around  7, and DO was around 3 -5 139 
mg/L. The samples were taken every 15 minutes for a total of 1 h, filtered by 0.45  μm 140 
filter and then analyzed for NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, NO 3--N concentrations by colorimetric 141 
method using HACH TNT kits ( HACH Loveland, CO ). At the end of  batch tests, the 142 
total suspended solids (TSS)  was measured according to the standard methods (APHA, 143 
2005) . AOB activity was calculated as the sum of nitrite and nitrate production rates 144

10 
 and NOB activity was calculated as the nitrate production rates by linear regression . 145 
2.3. Batch d enitrification activity  tests  146 
The batch denitrification activity tests were performed weekly on site. About 2 L 147 
RAS from B -stage secondary clarifier was mixed with A -stage effluent (soluble COD  148 
< 100 mg/L) and  20 mg N/L nitrate was spiked to perform the denitrification test. The 149 
samples  were taken every 15 minutes for a total of 1 h, filtered by 0.45  μm filter, and 150 
then analyzed for COD, NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, NO 3--N and TSS  concentrations using the 151 
same methods as previously described. The nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation 152 
rates were respective calculated by linear regression .  153 
In addition to the routine denitrification batch activity tests, the specific 154 
denitrification activity test with pre -incubation by fermentate was performed on site on 155 
day 63 to maximize the accumulation  of internal carbon source (like PHA) and identify 156 
which promoting the denitrification. Sludge from the anaerobic selector was incubated 157 
with A -stage WAS fermentate (VFA = 950 ± 40 mg COD/L) overnight, and then washed 158 
twice with B -stage secondary effluent (COD = 83.7 ± 11.5 mg/L). 10 mg N/L nitrate 159 
was spiked at first and the water and sludge samples were taken every 30 minutes for a 160 
total of 2 h. The analytical methods for soluble  COD (sCOD), NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, NO 3-- 161 
N and TSS  concentrations were the same as previously described. PHA  including poly- 162 
β-hydroxy -butyrate ( PHB), poly -β-hydroxy -valerate ( PHV), poly -β-hydroxy -2- 163 
methyl -valerate ( PH2MV) were extracted with a 3 h digestion time and 3% sulfuric 164 
acid, and analyzed by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC -MS) (Lanham et al., 165 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 2013) . The glycogen was extracted with a 2 h digestion time and 0.9 M hydrochloric 166 
acid, and analyzed by liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) 167 
(Wang et al., 2019a) . 168 
2.4. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing  169 
Genomic DNA of sludge samples from the B -stage during the operation were 170 
extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, USA) . The V4 region of the 171 
16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 515F/806R and then the amplicons 172 
were sequenced on the Il lumina’s MiSeq with V2 chemistry using paired -end (2 x 250) 173 
sequencing. The raw paired -end reads were assembled for each sample and analyzed 174 
following the standard operating procedure by Mothur software (Kozich et al., 2013) . 175 
High -quality reads were obtain ed after quality control and chimera screening and then 176 
clustered at a 97% similarity  to obtain the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) . The 177 
representative sequences of each OTU were annotated  based on Silva database (Quast 178 
et al., 2012) . The raw reads were  deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)  179 
database in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the accession 180 
number of PRJNA866204 . 181 
2.5. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)  182 
The gene abundance of total bacteria and nitrifiers were determined by the 183 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the CFX real -time PCR detection 184 
system (Bio -Rad, USA). The primer set s chosen for  AOB, NOB, complete ammonia 185 
oxidation (Comammox) and total bacteria were amoA -1F/2R  (Rotthauwe et al., 1997) , 186 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 nxrB -169F/638R  (Pester et al., 2014) , amoB 148F/485R  (Cotto et al., 2020)  and 16S 187 
rRNA -341F/534R (He et al., 2007) , respectively. The sequence and t hermocycling 188 
conditions for each primer were in supplementary information (Table S2).  The qPCR 189 
reaction mixture in total of 2 0 μL containing 1 μL DNA template, 1 μL each primer, 7 190 
μL RNase -free water and 1 0 μL iQ SYBR○R Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA). The 191 
standard curves were constructed from a series of 10 -fold dilutions of a  plasmid DNA  192 
obtained by TOPO TA cloning (ThermoFisher, USA). The R2 of standard curves were 193 
above  0.99 and the amplification efficiency could reach  around 95%.  194 
2.6. Single -cell Raman spectroscopy  (SCRS)  195 
The sludge samples at time 0, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h during the pre -incubated 196 
denitrification batch test with fermentate were respectively collected to acquire single - 197 
cell Raman spectra for  phenotypic profiling  of the microbial community  and the  details 198 
of Raman phenotyping analysis can be referred to the pr evious reference (Li et al., 199 
2018b; Majed and Gu, 2010) . Briefly,  the sludge samples were washed, diluted, 200 
homogenized by a 26 -gauge syringe needle and dried on optically polished CaF 2 201 
circular windows (Crystran, UK). Raman spectra of single -cell were scan ned from 400 202 
to 1800 cm-1 by a LabRam HR Evolution Raman microscope equipped with a 203 
magnification of x50 objective (HORIBA, Japan). The laser wavelength was 532 nm 204 
and the gratings were 600 grooves/mm with an acquisition time of 20s per spectrum. 205 
The spect ra data were processed with the smoothing and filtering, background 206 
subtraction, baseline correction steps by the software LabSpec 6 (Detailed key 207 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 parameters can be found in supporting information Text S1). The statistical sufficiency 208 
of the sampling size was recently evaluated by kernel divergence  computing method 209 
which showed that  an approximated sampling size of 50 or 100 spectra for full -scale 210 
EBPR  systems at 5% or 2% operational phenotypic units (OPUs)  cluster  resolution (Li 211 
et al., 2022; Majed et al., 2012) . A total of 131, 190, 197 and 209 Raman spectra of 212 
single cells were obtained finally at each sampling time. The presence of PHA in single 213 
cells was identified by the signature peaks in the range of 1715 -1740 cm-1 based on 214 
previous study (Majed and Gu, 2010) . The relative intensity of PHA for single cell was 215 
normalized by the intensity of amide I  vibration at 1640 -1690 cm-1 as the biomass 216 
marker. The hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was applied on all of the single -cell 217 
Raman spectra from a ctivated sludge samples to obtain phenotypic profiles based on 218 
OPUs, and  the cosine similarity (√2−2𝑟, r-correlation efficient) was used to measure 219 
metrics between two samples, average linkage was applied to quantify dissimilarities 220 
between two clusters an d the cutoff threshold for OPUs was set at 0.82 according to 221 
previous experiments (Li et al., 2018b) . 222 
3. Results and discussion  223 
3.1. Nitrite accumulation in A -B-S2EBPR system  224 
The A-B-S2EBPR  pilot plant was operated for around 100 days for this period of 225 
the study.  The average ammonium concentration of B -stage influent was 30.9 ± 3.7 mg 226 
N/L and the effluent ammonium was 6 .5 ± 1.4 mg N/L (Fig. 2A). Nitrite accumulation 227 
could be detected in B -stage effluent and reached the highest around 5.5 ± 0.3 mg N/L 228 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 (Fig. 2B), me anwhile, the B -stage effluent nitrate decreased gradually from 8.1 mg N/L 229 
to 1.0 mg N/L (Fig. 2C). The nitrite accumulation ratio (NAR)  calculated by the ratio 230 
of nitrite to the sum of nitrite and nitrate of B -stage effluent could reach 79 .1 ± 6.5%. 231 
With the further polishing step by MBBR, the overall effluent concentration of  total 232 
inorganic nitrogen (TIN)  was 4 .6 ± 1.8 mg N/L with remov al efficiency of 84 .9 ± 5.6% 233 
(Fig. 2D).  234

 was caused by o peration al issues).  242 
Carbon and nitrogen mass balance were further calculated for the A -B-S2EBPR 243 
pilot system during the operation period where the nitrite accumulation occurred. For 244 
soluble carbon (sCOD), the integration of A-stage WAS fermenter  largely supplement 245 
the carbon input to the S2EBPR and then to the B -stage tanks, enhanced from solely B - 246 
stage influent of 343.2 g/d to the total of 569.3 g/d (Fig. 3A). For inorganic nitrogen, 247 
B-stage influent was the main source of n itrogen input to the down -steam, accounting 248 
for 87.5% of the total nitrogen input. But it was noted that most carbon (59.4%) from 249 
fermentate was captured in S2EBPR and the residuals went into the anoxic and aerobic 250 
tanks of B -stage were very limited with t he average soluble COD concentration of on ly 251 
58.3 ± 13.3 mg/L , leading to the low TIN removal efficiency of 25.4%. However, the 252 
nitrite mass flow gradually increased along the B -stage tanks from 5.4 g/d to 28.5 g/d 253 
and the NAR could reach 41.7% at the 4th AE tank, which could provide the 254 
intermediate nitrite to enable the short -cut nitrogen removal of the subsequent MBBR.  255 
MBBR played the main function of TIN removal with the removal efficiency of 69.8% 256

3.2. Nitrite accumulation was mainly caused by partial denitrification  262 
To investigate the cause of nitrite accumulation in the B -stage, we simultaneously 263 
evaluated multiple aspects including AOB/NOB activities and denitrification activities, 264 
amo and nxr gene abundance indicative of AOB and NOB, as well as nitr ogen species 265 
analysis during the intermittent aeration cycles in the B -stage reactor (Fig. 4).  266

 detected between the specific activity of AOB and NOB during the operation period 268 
where nitrite accumulated (n = 16, p = 0.2 3, one -way ANOVA ) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, 269 
the functional gene abundance of AOB ( amo gene ) and NOB ( nxr gene ) were detected  270 
by qPCR  and t he results showed that the average abundance of nitrate -reducing nxr 271 
gene  [(2.3 ± 1.2) × 1010 gene copies/g SS] was two magnitudes  higher than that of 272 
ammonia -oxidizing amo gene [(6.3 ± 5.5) × 108 gene copies/g SS] (Fig. 4B), which 273 
indicated that NOB -out-selection was not achieved in this system.  It was also noted that 274 
the relative abundance of AOB (calculated as the ratio of amo gene copies to 16S rRNA 275 
gene) was as low as 0.13 ± 0.13%. The relative abundance of comammox was also at 276 
very low level of 0.12 ± 0.11% (Fig. S1). These evidenced that PN was unlikely the 277 
main process that led to nitrite accumulation. The denitrification batch activity tests 278 
showed that w ith the reduction of nitrate, the nitrite gradually accumulated with the net 279 
growth rate of 0.68 ± 0.34 mg N/(g SS ·h) (Fig. 4D), which was  consistent with the 280 
periodic time cycle of nitrogen conversion in the B -stage AE tank. The nitrite 281 
accumulation only occurred in the anoxic phase with concurrent nitrate decline and 282 
nitrite was oxidized in the aerobic phase (Fig. 4C). These collective evi dences led to 283 
our conclusion that partial denitrification was the main pathway leading to the observed 284 
nitrite accumulation.  285 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted March 29, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.28.534645doi: bioRxiv preprint

3.3. Partial denitrification associated with internal carbon utilization  293 
Two observations that led to our hypothesis that PHA could be the potential 294 
internal carbon to drive the partial denitrification in the A -B-S2EBPR pilot system. First, 295 
according to the mass balance analysis in our pilot system, most of carbon from 296 
fermentate was captured in A -stage and then fed into S2EBPR and very low soluble 297

 COD residual entering into the anoxic and aerobic tanks of B -stage with average 298 
concentration of on ly 58.3  ± 13.3 mg/L  (Fig. 2). Second, our previous study via Raman - 299 
based observation suggested that the PHA -containing cells were significantly higher in 300 
the S2EBPR system in comparison to those in the conventiona l EBPR systems (Wang 301 
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018) . Coupling of internal carbon (PHA) utilization and 302 
partial denitrification were also observed by others (Ji et al., 2017; Krasnits et al., 2013; 303 
Tu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b) . To test this hypoth esis, we performed 304 
denitrification batch tests with no external carbon addition, where sludge samples that 305 
were pre -incubated with fermentate to enrich for PHA -accumulating or ganisms and 306 
then washed prior to the batch test to remove all residue soluble carbon.  The results 307 
showed that without adding external carbon (the bulk residual sCOD fluctuated 308 
between 45 -80 mg/L), nitrite accum ulated from 1.4 mg N/L to 2.8 mg N/L with nitrate 309 
reduction from 9.4 mg N/L to 0.8 mg N/L (Fig. 5). In contrast, in a parallel 310 
denitrification test, no nitrite accumulatio n was observed when external carbon acetate 311 
was added , and PHA accumulated ins tead of being consumed (Fig. S2). Bulk measured 312 
PHA declined from 54.6 to 44.8 mg/g TS concurrently with nitrate decline, w hile the 313 
concentration of glycogen fluctuated between 65.0 to 88.7 mg/g TS. The stoichiometric 314 
analysis confirmed that the ratio of PHA consumption to nitrate reduction was 4.17 g/g  315 
N, which was comparable with the theoretical PHB -driven denitrification ra tio of 1.71 - 316 
4.39 g/g N (Hiraishi and Khan, 2003) .  317 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

3.4. Potential roles of PHA -accumulating microorganisms in PDN in the pilot A - 321 
B-S2EBPR system  322 
The microbial communities of the A -B-S2EBPR pilot system were investigated by 323 
temporal 16S rRNA gene amp licon sequencing. At the phylum level (Fig. 6A), 324 
Proteobacteria  was the most  dominated with the relative abundance of 51.4%, where 325 
most denitrifiers belong to the different classes of Proteobacteria  (α-, β-, γ-, and ε- 326 
Proteobacteria ) (Braker and Conrad, 2011) . Firmicutes , as the  well-known fermenters, 327 
were the second abundant phyla  (23.4%) and often widely distributed in anaerobic 328 
digesters (Garcia et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014) . At genus level (Fig. 6B), Acinetobacter  329 
was the most abundant genera with the relative abundance of ( 17.8 ± 15.5) %, followed 330 
by Comamonadaceae  (6.7 ± 3.4%), Beijerinckiaceae  (5.3 ± 4.5%) and 331

21 
 Enterobacteriaceae  (5.1 ± 2.9%). None of the reads belonging to the conventional AOB 332 
were sequenced and Nitrospira  was the only detectable NOB with the percentage as 333 
low as 0.2 ± 0.2%. This was consistent with the activities and gene abundance results 334 
of AOB and NOB discussed previously (Fig. 4A & 4B) . It is also conceivable that there 335 
exist other unknown AOB that was not captured by the sequencing analysis that 336 
performed ammonia oxidation. The surprisingly high abundance of Acinetobacter  337 
species suggested that it may play the functional role in our system. A number of  338 
Acinetobacter  species  were reported to have the abi lity of simultaneous heterotrophic 339 
nitrification and aerobic denitrification  (Chen et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2013; Su et al., 340 
2015; Yang et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2013) , which may provide one possible explanation 341 
for  (at least partially) why the relativ ely high ammonium oxidation activities 342 
observed (Fig. 4A) when almost no known autotrophic nitrifiers was detected. The  pure 343 
culture of Acinetobacter junii  isolated from activated sludge was proved to not only 344 
oxidize ammonium, but can also reduce nitrate with nitrite accumulation observed (Ren 345 
et al., 2014) . Furthermore , Acinetobacter sp. were demonstrated to have the ability of 346 
synthe sizing PHA as the internal carbon storage  (Anburajan et al., 2019; Yang et al., 347 
2013) . Comamonadaceae  are a large and diverse bacterial family of the  348 
Betaproteobacteria  and we re affiliated with denitrifying groups , especially a number 349 
of PHA -degrading denitrifying bacteria have been assigned phylogenetically to the 350 
family Comamonadaceae  (Hiraishi and Khan, 2003) . Comamonadaceae  were also 351 
detected to be dominant in the partial denitrification system  (Du et al., 2016; Wu et al., 352 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 2018) . In addition, the family Beijerin ckiaceae  include a metabolically diverse aerobic 353 
bacteria from obligate methanotrophs to chemoorganoheterotrophs  and have a genera 354 
trait of forming poly -b-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules  (Marín and Arahal, 2014) . The 355 
family Enterobacteriaceae  are facultative anaerob es with the ability of fermenting 356 
glucose to produce lactic acid and reducing nitrate to nitrite (Brenner and Farmer III, 357 
2015) .  358

 denitrification, the sludges at different time of denitrification batch test pre incubated 363 
by fermentate were sampled and detected by single -cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) 364 
to iden tify the main operational phenotypic units (OPUs) in the biomass via HCA 365 
analysis. Previous studies indicated that single -cell Raman signature allowed for 366 
identification of organism at resolution l evel comparable to species or even strain level 367 
(Hutsebaut et al., 2006; Li et al., 2018b) . With the aim to obtain further insights in the 368 
role of PHA and PHA -accumulating organisms in partial denitrification, s ingle -cell 369 
Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) was applied to phenotyping the microbial community and 370 
to reveal th e variations of relevant intracellular storage  polymers during the batch 371 
denitrification test (Li et al., 2018b; Majed et al., 2012) . Three main dominant 372 
operational phenotypic units (OPUs, named OPU 1 -3) were detected by hierarchical 373 
clustering analysis ( HCA) of SCRS spectrum (Fig. 7A). OPU1 (operational phenotypic 374 
unit) was the most dominant one with the relative abundance of 5.26 -25.89% based on 375 
the phenotypic analysis (Fig. 7B), and the intracellular PHA were only detected in cells 376 
within the OPU1.  The average relative Raman intensity of PHA in the cells of OPU1 377 
declined from 2.51 to 1.54 (Fig. 7C). To get insights on the phylogenetic identities of 378 
cells in OPU1, we clustered the single cell Raman spectra ob tained from the biomass 379 
in our system with avai lable spectrum obtaine d from pure culture of Acinetobacter junii  380 
and Comamonas testosteroni  (Fig. S3) . The results showed that the dominant OPUs 381 
were closer to Acinetobacter sp. compared to the Comamonas sp., implying  that 382 
Acinetobacter sp. are more likely  the dominant cell in OPU1 and likely the potential 383 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 functional microorganisms involved in PDN (Fig. S3). Moreover, the nitrification and 384 
denitrification rates in this study were also quantitively comparable with the pure 385 
culture study results of Acinetobac ter junii  (Ren et al., 2014) , which had the highest 386 
similarity (>98%) to the representative OTU of Acinetobacter  genus retrieved from our 387 
sample via sequence alignment. The ammonium oxidation rate in the nitrification batch 388 
activity tests was calculated as  2.39 ± 0.67 mg N/(g SS·h), which was in the range of 389 
1.71 - 4.27 mg N/(g SS·h) of the Acinetobacter junii , and the nitrate reduction rate in 390 
the denitrification batch activity tests was 2.04 ± 0.47 mg N/(g SS·h), which was lower 391 
than the pure culture of 4 .20 mg N/(g SS·h) probably explained by the lower C/N ratio 392 
(< 5) applied. Overall, we deduc ed that partial denitrification led to the nitrite 393 
accumulation in the B -stage and PHA played the role as the potential internal carbon 394 
source.  Although further confirmation needed with more investigations. Nevertheless, 395 
these results, for the first time, provided direct and cellular level evidence that PHA 396 
maybe the potential internal carbon of the dominated bacteria clustered in OPU1 to 397 
support the parti al denitrification process in absence of external carbon.  398 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

3.5. Significance and i mplications of this study  406 
In this study, the new concept of integrating sidestream EBPR (S2EBPR) to the 407 
sustainable mainstream A -B process was tested in a pilot scale and the dominant 408 
microorganisms were identified by the combination of ph ylogenetic and phenotypic 409 
analysis for the first time. To enable EBPR that otherwise would be considered 410 
infeasible with A -B, the fermentate produced from the A -stage sludge digestion allowed 411 
carbon redirection in a more controllable manner to the S2EBPR r eactor. Mass balance 412

26 
 and SCRS -based phenotypic analysis suggested that the innovative configuration of the 413 
A-B-S2EBPR system seemed to enrich for the internal -carbon -containing heterotrophic 414 
bacteria. Nitrite accumulation induced by internal carbon -driven partial denitrification 415 
was evidenced to be the major nitrogen transformation pathway, which was combined 416 
with the downstream anammox to achieve efficient complete nitrogen removal for 417 
municipal wastewater. Unlike the previous method to achieve PDN via lim iting external 418 
carbon to nitrogen ratio, which can often be infeasible to emply in practice, our study 419 
demonstrated that the excess external carbon via sludge fermentation could be 420 
transformed to the internal carbon source (i.e., PHA) in the S2EBPR reactor , and then 421 
served as the electron donor to drive the slow nitrate reduction over nitrite, which will 422 
facilitate the PDN process. This study could provide us a new strategy to utilize the 423 
sidestream sludge hydrolysis and fermentation to enrich the internal -carbon -containing 424 
heterotrophs to solve the long -existing SRT contradiction between autotrophic nitrifiers 425 
and heterotrophic PAOs, and finally achieve the simultaneous biological nitrogen and 426 
phosphorus removal.  427 
Microbiologically, the exact functional org anisms performing the partial 428 
denitrification have not been identified till now. Different from the known potential 429 
partial denitrifiers ( Thauera  and Halomonas ) detected in the PDN systems, our pilot 430 
system enriched the genera of Acinetobacter (17.8 ± 15.5) % and Comamonadaceae  431 
(6.7 ± 3 .4%), with the very low level of conventional nitrifiers detected (< 0.2%). The 432 
species Acinetobacter  junii were previously reported to exhibit the ability of efficient 433 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

27 
 N- and P -removal, respectively (Han et al., 2018; Re n et al., 2014) . Moreover, rather 434 
than the common chemical analysis of the overall PHA variation, we applied the single - 435 
cell Raman spectroscopy technique to accurately reveal the existing dominant 436 
microorganism (the potential Acinetobacter  sp.) in the A -B-S2EBPR system that 437 
contained the intracellular PHA, which could be the potential electron donor to drive 438 
the PDN. However, the phylogenetic identity and the functional ability to denitrify of 439 
the PHA -accumulating bacteria still needs to be investigated in depth via the joint 440 
analysis of the single -cell sorting based genomics.   441 
4. Conclusions  442 
This study, for the first time, demonstrated an efficient short -cut nitrogen removal 443 
via nitrite that was provided mostly from internal carbon -driven partial denitrificati on 444 
in a pilot A -B-S2EBPR system for treating municipal wastewater. The following 445 
conclusions were obtained:  446 
(1) Nitrite accumulation was detected in B -stage intermittently aerated tanks with the 447 
effluent concentration and NAR of 5.5 ± 0.3 mg N/L and 79 .1 ± 6.5%, respectively. The 448 
effluent TIN concentration and removal efficiency of the A -B-S2EBPR system could 449 
reach 4 .6 ± 1.8 mg N/L and 84 .9 ± 5.6%.  450 
(2) Nitrite accumulation was proved to be caused mostly by partial denitrification 451 
process without NOB out -selection as confirmed by both activities assessment and 452 
microbial analysis of AOB and NOB.  453 
(3) The integration of S2EBPR could largely reshape the nitrogen microbial 454 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

 communities and enrich the internal carbon -accumulating candidate denitrifying genera 455 
inclu ding Acinetobacter  (17.8 ± 15.5%) and Comamonadaceae  (6.7 ± 3.4%). 456 
(4) PHA was ap proved to be the potential internal carbon source for partial 457 
denitrification as evidenced by phenotypic analysis and intracellular PHA analysis at 458 
single -cell and OUP -level via Raman spectroscopy.  459
