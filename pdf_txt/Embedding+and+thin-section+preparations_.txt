Abstract—The effects of Modified Zarrouk Medium (MZM) 
with different pH on Spirulina maxima  culture were 
determined using five parameters: the growth rate, lag 
phase duration, nutrients (protein, carbohydrate and lipid), 
pigments (chlorophyll-a, betacarotene and phycocyanin), 
and morphology of the algae. The experiment was divided 
into 4 treatments.  All treatment contained the same MZM; 
however, different initial pH of 9, 9.5, 10 and 10.5 were 
applied to the experiment al treatment I, II, III and IV, 
respectively. The parameters of these treatments were 
compared to those of the positive control (the Zarrouk 
medium pH 9). The results showed that the algae grown in 
media treatment I could reduce the duration of lag phase 
and gave the highest specific growth rate (4.12
 0.005 g /l), 
while the algae grown  in media treatment IV provided the 
lowest specific growth rate (1.09
 0.006 g /l). Regarding 
nutrients, the algae grown in media treatment I provided  
highest protein content of 71.0± 0.06  % and the alg ae grown 
in media treatment III provided the highest carbohydrate 
content of 17.07± 0.02 %. It was found that algae grown in 
media treatment I yielded the best in pigment contents, 
which were the chlorophyll -a (15.2± 0.16 mg/g), beta -
carotene (3.16± 0.32 mg/g ) and phycocyanin (46.37± 0.20 
mg/g). The Morphological studies  of algae using microscope 
SEM and TEM revealed that most trichome of algae grown 
in media treatment III and group IV were changed from 
helicoidal to straight.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Spirulina maxima  is a Bluegreen algae that can fully 
thrive in tropical zones. Taken as highly valuable algae, it 
gains popularity among various types of industries, such 
as therapeutic and cosmetics industry. They use some 
important substances for secondary product and 
phycocyanin extracted from Spirulina maxima [1]. In 
medical field, it is used to prevent and cure many diseases 
e.g. prevention of diabetes [2] anti-inflammation [3] 
reduction of swelling, and resistant of Entervirus71 [4]. 
                                                           
Manuscript received May 11, 2013; revised July 11, 2013. Moreover, Spirulina maxima  is used in dietary 
supplement industry. Globally, the production of 
Spirulina maxima  is 3,000 tons (dry weight) per year [5] 
with Mexico, Japan and USA as the top three largest 
producer s. 
In Thailand, there are only three companies with the 
highest production capacity, and more ten small scale 
producers. Spirulina maxima  culture techniques vary 
from place to place based on geographical locations and 
producers’ knowledge.  Consequently, there are numerous 
studies on various aspects of Spirulina maxima  
cultivation as  a variety of factors influence the 
cultivation including intensity of starter, strain,  pH level , 
light intensity, carbon level, and temperature [6].  
Regarding the essential factors stated, it is found that 
Thailand has favorable temperature, light intensity, and 
strain. Thus, further experiments have been conducted on 
other factors that are controllable and help to increase 
productivity [7] . For example, there are studies on carbon 
dioxide [8]  and pH level as  Spirulina maxima  grows in 
high pH level media [9]-[ 11], and pH level also influence 
carbon dioxide and mineral dissolution as well as  
metabolism process in Spirulina maxima  cells [9]. 
This research is a part of a producer who is willing to 
study the effects of Modified Zarrouk Medium at 
different initial pH levels which are related to growth rate, 
lag phase duration, necessary food, pigment, and forms of 
Spirulina maxima, in order to be applied in implantation 
in large scale industry and to be used as a database for 
gathering information of other factors influencing 
upbringing and yielding products with quality. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
A. Preparation of Stock Culture 
Spirulina maxima  is collected at the Institute of 
Research and Food Products, Kasetsart University, 
Bangkok, Thailand. The stock culture of Spirulina 
maxima  was prepared in pond (4x15x0.2  cubic meter) 
using Zarrouk medium as the media. Medium was stirred 
using paddles and allowing sun light pass through the 
medium.   The Spirulina maxima  stock culture was readily 
to be used when the optical density reached 1.0 (OD 560).  Journal of Medical and Bioengineering Vol. 2, No. 4, December  2013

a B. Effect of pH on Cultivation of Spirulina Maxima 
The Spirulina maxima  was cultured in Modified 
Zarrouk Medium with different initial pH (i.e. pH 9- 10.5). 
The pH of the medium was adjusted using NaOH solution. 
C. Growth Measurement  
The optical density was measured at 560 nm using 
spectrophotometer. The optical density was measured for 
everyday and the pH was measured twice a day. Algae 
cells were filtered using straining cloth (filter cloth). The 
filtered algae was dried in oven at 60 C for 6 hrs. The 
dried algae was weighed and recorded.  
D. Analysis of Nutritional Value and Pigment   
The nutritional values (i.e. protein, fat, and 
carbohydrate) were analyzed using the method published 
by Chu et. al  [10]. The pigments (chlorophyll, carotene, 
phycocyanin) were determined using spectrophotometry 
[1], [11], [12].  
E. Morphological Studies 
Algae was post fixed in 0.2% OsO 4, then it was 
dehydrated by passage through an acetone-water series 
(25-50-75-100% acetone), and then dried at the critical 
point in liquid CO 2. All samples were viewed by 
scanning electron microscope (SEM), JEOL. 
Trichome morphology of Spirulina maxima  was 
studied by the transmission electron microscope (TEM) 
[13].  Algae was collected in 1-ml centrifuge tubes  and 
then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 min, followed by 
separate fixation in 0.1 M sucrose solution containing 4% 
glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 
7.0) at 4° C for 2 hrs. They were then rinsed twice with a 
0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer containing 10 mM CaCl 2, 
and sucrose concentration successively reduced to 0.05 M. 
This treatment was followed by two rinses by 0.1 M 
sodium cacodylate buffer containing 10 mM CaCl 2. Post-
fixation was performed with 2% OsO4 in   0.1 M sodium 
cacodylate buffer containing 10 mM CaCl 2 for 1 hr at 
4° C. Thereafter, all materials were rinsed four times with 
a sodium cacodylate buffer containing 10 mM CaCl 2, 
three times with aqueous ethanol (50%) and gradually 
dehydrated in ethanol (40, 80, 95, 100%). Dehydrated 
materials were prepared for transmission electron 
microscope (TEM, JEOL,  JEM -2100) . 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
A. Growth Measurement  
The growth of Spirulina maxima  in MZM at different 
initial pH was studied (T1, pH 9.0; T2, pH 9.5; T3, pH 10; 
T4, pH 10.5). Optical density measurement was used to 
assess Spirulina maxima  growth. From Fig. 1, the optical 
density of all treatments was started at 0.2. The highest 
optical density was found in T1 (pH 9.0) at day 5.  
Exponential growth phase was found during this day. 
This value is not significantly different to the value 
obtained in T2 (optical density =0.58), but it is 
significantly different to T3 (optical density=0.3) and T4 
(optical density=0.2). The statistically confident level at 
p≤0.05 was used throughout this work.

Considering the growth rate using term of µ  max (d-1), 
the results can be shown in Table I. It was found that 
T1(pH9) posed highest rate at 0.40. Meanwhile, the 
growth rates for T2, T3 and T4 were 0.37, 0.31 and 0.03 , 
respectively. Algae in T1 is able to reduce the lag phase 
to 5 days, and it also posed highest the specific growth 
rate (4.12± 0.005 grams per liter) and protein production 
(71.0± 0.06 percent).  The lowest rate of carbohydrate 
production was found in T3 (pH 10). Its value was 
14.70± 0.02 percent.   
The effect of initial pH on the production of 
chlorophyll, beta carotene, and phycocyanin were studied . 
The results obtained are shown in Table II.  The highest 
amount of chlorophyll, beta carotene, and phycocyanin 
were obtained from T1 (pH 9.0). Their values were 
15.2± 0.16 milligrams per gram, 3.16± 0.32 milligrams per 
gram, and 46.37± 0.20 milligrams per gram, respectively.

267 ©2013 Engineering and Technology PublishingB. Morphological Studies 
Morphological studies were conducted by using 
microscope technique, SEM, and TEM. The result of high 
growth rate obtained from treatment 1 (pH 9.0) and the 
less growth rate obtained from treatment 4 (pH 10.5) 
were interesting results.  
Therefore, the results from these two systems were 
chosen to further discussion and compare in term of its 
morphologies. From microscope results, the algae cells in 
treatment 1 (pH 9) is spiral (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, the 
algae cells in treatment 4 (pH 10.5) has become 
unscrewed forming the line shape (Fig. 3 A). These 
obtained results are agreed well with the report of Kim et 
al [14] i.e. at high pH 11.5  to 12.5 the mount of spirals is 
decreasing and finally becoming straight line.   
The 3D structures of algae obtained from treatment 1 
and 4 were studied by SEM experimentation.  Their 
shapes were totally different. The equally twisting shape 
was shown for algae in treatment 1 (Fig. 2B). The whole 
straight line shape was obtained for algae in treatment 4 
(Fig. 3B).  
Therefore, increasing initial pH level restrains the 
spiral shape. Beside the pH variation, other factors such 
as salinity, environment would be able to affect the 
transforming shape (spiral to straight) [15]. 
The change of internal elements of cells and membrane 
after pH variation was studied by TEM. For treatment 1-
pH 9 (Fig. 2C), the separated septum inside algae cell and 
the gas vacuoles spreading around layers was observed.  
Meanwhile, for treatment 4-pH 10.5 (Fig. 3C), the 
unclear septum, less gas vacuoles in some parts and cell 
wall were observed.

Therefore, the monitoring of cell status and the 
appropriate harvest time of S. platensis  were determined 
using the dry cell weight, growth rate, lag phase duration, 
nutrient production, pigment production, and morphology 
of the algae .  From the results obtained, it was found that the algae cultivation in MZM at pH 9-9.5 gave the good 
results in term of all parameters studied as well as its 
morphology. In this pH, the spiral algae shape was 
observed. It is convenient for algae harvest (filtering 
through 40 um filter cloth).  
The experimentation, determination, and data 
evaluation taking place in this work would be the fruitful 
example, and provide useful information for small and 
large scale cultivations of S. maxima .  The large scale up 
to the industrial scale would be beneficial.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
The growth rate, lag phase duration, nutrients (protein, 
carbohydrate and lipid), pigments (chlorophyll-a, 
betacarotene and phycocyanin) and the morphology of S. 
maxima  is strongly dependent on the pH of MZM system.   
Algae in T1 (pH 9) is able to reduce the lag phase to 5 
days, and it also posed highest the specific growth rate 
(4.12± 0.005 grams per liter) and protein production 
(71.0± 0.06 percent).  In addition, the highest amount of 
chlorophyll, beta carotene, and phycocyanin were 
obtained from T1 (pH 9.0). Their values were 15.2± 0.16 
milligrams per gram, 3.16± 0.32 milligrams per gram, and 
46.37± 0.20 milligrams per gram, respectively. From 
microscope and SEM monitoring, the algae cells in 
treatment 1 (pH 9) is spiral shape; meanwhile it is straight 
line at higher pH ( 10-10.5). The spiral shape is more 
convenient in algae harvesting step (filtering through 40 
um filter cloth).  From the TEM studies, it was found that 
the septum inside algae cell and the gas vacuoles inside 
algae cell were obviously dependent on the pH variation. 
At high pH (10-10.5), the unclear septum, less gas 
vacuoles in some parts and cell wall were observed.  This 
affects to the mass ratio of wet/dry algae weights. 
Therefore, based on the results obtained in this work, the 
low pH at 9 is suitable for S. maxima  cultivation. This 
result would be fruitful for the application to the large 
and industrial scales.
