Abstract 
The mono-azo dye, Orange II, solution was substanti ally degraded with cast iron particles under varied  conditions of experimental 
variables such as pH, initial dye concentration and  cast iron dosage.At all solution pH studied, the d egradation efficiency achieved 
was > 90%. With an initial dye concentration of 100  mg/L and optimum cast iron load of 28.56 g/L, the optimum degradation 
efficiency of 97.63% was achieved at pH 3. With sam e cast iron load and solution pH, more than 95% dye  degradation efficiency was 
achieved at different initial Orange II concentrati ons ranging from 50-500 mg/L. The efficiency of cas t iron particles in degrading 
Orange II dye was compared with that of pure elemen tal iron used in other study. Cast iron particles s howed better degradation 
efficiencies than elemental iron that too at relati vely lower dosages. Ultimately, from the results it  can be inferred that cast iron 
fillings can be successfully applied to treat texti le effluents containing high dye concentration and treatment efficiency can be 
enhanced by optimizing the reaction conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Textile dyeing industries have long been one of the  most 
important industries in the world. According to an estimate, 
around 0.7 million tons of dye are used every year of which 
50% are azo dyes [1]. Of the total dye produced, 15 % is lost 
during the dyeing process [2]. Dyes being tinctoria lly stronger 
are visible in water at concentrations as low as 1 ppm [3]. 
Available literatures points that dye containing ef fluent are 
more mutagenic and toxic when compared to other ind ustrial 
discharges [4]. Researchers have shown that azo dye s released 
into ground and surface waters from textile dischar ges 
contribute to mutagenic activity [5,6]. Besides, th e release of 
coloured wastewater in the ecosystem is a remarkabl e source 
of aesthetic pollution, eutrophication, and perturb ations in 
aquatic life [2].Several chemicals found in dye-bat h effluent 
are toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic to various 
life forms. The human health impact of dyes, especi ally azo 
dyes and their degradation products have caused con cern for a 
number of years, with legislation controlling their  use, being 
developed in a variety of countries [7]. Increasing ly, the 
environment and subsequent health effects of azo dy es 
released in textile industry wastewater are becomin g subject to 
scientific scrutiny. It is hence not surprising tha t removal of 
these compounds has now-a-days become a major 
environmental concern. 
 
Many physical and chemical treatment processes have  been 
developed in scientific laboratory but their practi cal 
applicability is restricted either by cost or effic iency and cannot be adopted as an exclusive method.Convention al 
biological treatment methods alone generally are in effective 
insofar as complete azo dye degradation is concerne d[8]. 
Since biological treatment methods are still the ch eapest 
option available, efforts should be made to develop  an 
effective pretreatment technology that could transf orm the azo 
dyes into easily bio-decomposable compounds. 
 
Reductive transformation of pollutants using cast i ron filings 
is widely gaining attention for environmental remed iation. 
Cast iron filings are cheap and easily available st rong reducing 
agent. The literature substantially reports the app licability of 
cast iron filings in treating wastewater contaminat ed with 
chlorinated compounds [9], nitroaromatic compounds [10], 
heavy metals [11], explosives[12] and dyes[13], etc . Among 
these pollutants azo dyes are considered as most su sceptible to 
metallic reduction [14], thus, if the treatment con ditions are 
optimized cast iron filings can serve as an effecti ve 
pretreatment alternative. In this study, treatment of synthetic 
wastewater containing mono-azo dye Orange II has be en 
carried out using cast iron filings. This study int ends to 
optimize the key reaction parameters that could aff ect the 
applicability of cast iron filings for treating azo  dye-containing 
wastewater in large scale. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1. Dye 
Commercially available mono-azo dye Orange II (M.W. -
350.32)which is a widely used anionic monoazo-dye [ 15] was IJRET: International Journal of Research in Enginee ring and Technology      eISSN: 2319-1163 | pISSN: 2321-7308

dyes due to its resistance to biological degradatio n.AO7 was 
purchased from Atul Ltd. (India) and was used as re ceived. 
The dye solutions in a 1cm quartz cuvette were scan ned over 
the wavelength range 200–800nm using a UV–visible 
spectrophotometer (UV-1800 series, Shimadzu, Japan)  for 
determination of the wavelength of maximum absorban ce ( λ 
max). 
 
2.2 Preparation of Cast Iron Fillings 
Commercially available cast iron rod was chipped on  a lathe 
machine and then ground into iron filings in a doug h-size ball 
mill. The filings were sieved and those between 40 (425 μm) 
and 80 (212 μm) mesh sizes were retained for use. Cast iron 
fillings, thus produced, was washed 5-6 times with N2-sparged 
1N HCl with periodic shaking. Then it was rinsed 10 -12 times 
with N2-sparged deionised (Milli Q) water. The wash ed 
fillings were rinsed twice with acetone to remove m oisture. 
Again it was rinsed twice with 95% pure ethanol and  dried for 
1 hour. This treatment yielded black metallic filin gs with no 
visible rust on the surface. Fillings were stored i n a vacuum 
desiccator until use in various experiments.Surface  area of the 
treated filings was determined by BET (N2) analysis  using a 
BET surface area analyzer (NOVA 4000e, Quanta chrom e 
Instruments, USA) to be 1.4 m2/ g.  
 
2.3 Experimental Procedure 
Time series batch experiments were carried out in 3 5 ml 
capacity glass vials with screw caps (Borosil, Indi a). All dye 
solutions were prepared using deionized (Milli Q) w ater and 
all reagents utilized were of analytical purity. Th e solution pH 
was adjusted to the desired levels using HCl (0.5M)  or NaOH 
(0.1 M) with a pH meter (Digital pH meter 111, EI, India). For 
proper mixing, the vials were placed on a test tube  rotator 
(Rotospin, Tarsons, India), at 30 rpm, keeping the axis of vials 
horizontal. Temperature was 25 ± 2 ○C for all experiments.  
Vials were removed from the rotator in duplicate (a long with a 
control) at specified times for sampling and analys is and were 
put on a magnet to allow iron particles to settle d own quickly. 
Supernatant samples were taken out from vials and f iltered 
through GF/C filter paper (1.2 µm nominal pore size , What 
man, Springfield Mill, England).  
 
2.4 Analytical Procedure 
Efficiency of cast iron fillings for the degradatio n of Orange II 
was assessed in terms of decolorization efficiency (%) as 
follows: 
 
Degradation efficiency (%) = 	1AA⁄]	100%  (1) 
 
Where At = absorbance of solution at time‘t’ of tre atment,  
 
A0 = absorbance of untreated solution. 
 3.0 RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
3.1 UV-Vis Scan 
The UV-vis spectra of Orange II scanned over wavele ngth 
range of 200 to 800 nm is shown in Fig.1. Different  
absorbance peaks exhibit different structural units  and groups 
of the dye molecule.Orange II is characterized by o ne main 
band in visible region, with its maximum absorption  at 484 
nm, and two bands in ultraviolet region located at   229 nm 
and 310.5 nm. These observed peaks correspond to 
chromophore containing azo linkage, benzene ring an d 
naphthalene ring, respectively [16].

3.2 Effect of Solution pH 
Solution pH has been considered as one of the impor tant 
factors in governing the reduction of contaminants by 
elemental iron, therefore the effect of initial sol ution pH on the 
decolorization of Orange II was studied, and the re sults are 
shown in Fig.2. The degradation efficiency crossed more than 
90% within 5 min of treatment.Final Orange II degra dation 
efficiency after 60 min of treatment was 97.63%,97. 11%, 
96.97%, 95.14%, 93.95%,for pH 3, pH 4, pH 5, pH 6 a nd pH 
7, respectively. As the solution pH increased decol orization 
efficiency decreased.When dye molecule collides wit h 
elemental iron, elemental iron, as an electron dono r, loses 
electrons, the dye molecule, as an electron accepto r, accepts 
electrons, and combines with H+to form a transition al product. 
This product receives electrons from elemental iron  and 
combines with H+ again, finally turning into termin al 
products. With more H+ in acid solution than that i n alkaline 
solution, the reaction in acid solution is easier [ 17].

3.3 Effect of Initial Dye Concentration 
The effect of initial concentrations of Orange II o n its 
degradation efficiency were evaluated at a concentr ation range 
of 50 mg/L to 500 mg/L using 28.56 mg/L cast iron d osage at 
pH 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the degradation efficienc ies 
achieved after 5 min was decreasing with increasing  initial 
Orange II concentration, i.e., 97.21, 94.81, 92.48, 75.18, 57.07 
and 47.63% for initial dye concentrations of 50 mg/ L, 100 
mg/L, 200 mg/L, 300 mg/L, 400 mg/L and 500 mg/L, 
respectively. This suggests that the decolorization  is 
adsorption controlled process [18]. The final effic iencies were 
greater than 95% after 60 min of treatment for all 
concentrations of Orange II studied.

The effect of the cast iron dosage on on Orange II removal 
efficiency,shown in Fig. 4, indicates that Orange I I 
degradation efficiency increased with the increase of the cast 
iron load. From the experimental data 54.93%, 75.13 %, 
96.25%, 96.79% and 96.91% degradation efficiencies within 
first 5 min, and96.36, 97.63, 99.42, 99.21 and 99.2 1%after 60 
min by cast iron doses of 7.14g/l, 14.28g/l, 28.56g /l, 42.84g/l 
and 57.12g/l, respectively. Increasing the load of cast iron 
provided substantially more active surface sites to  accelerate 
the initial reaction, resulting in more iron surfac e collision 
with more azo dye molecules to enhance Orange II 
degradation. However, highest degradation efficienc y was 
achieved at cast iron dosage of 28.56 g/L. This unu sual 
precept can be attributed to the fact that the pres ence of 
excessive iron in the acidic solution system could be 
detrimental since the final pH of the system could reach higher 
values thereby decreasing the degradation rate [19] .

3.5 Comparison of Efficiencies of Cast Iron Filling s 
and Pure Iron 
Table 1 shows the comparative degradation efficienc ies of 
Orange II using pure elemental iron as reported by Mu et 
al.[18], and cast iron fillings reported in this wo rk. Mu et 
al.[18] have reported highest degradation efficienc y of 90-95% 
for 101.5 mg/L Orange II adding 66.6g/L of pure iro n after 80 
min of reaction time. Whereas in this study greater  than 99% IJRET: International Journal of Research in Enginee ring and Technology      eISSN: 2319-1163 | pISSN: 2321-7308

II using fairly low cast iron loading of 28.56 g/L within 60 
min of reaction time. Also, the mixing speed was ke pt 4 times 
lower at 30 rpm in this study compared to 120 rpm r eported by 
Mu et al.[18]. In addition, cast iron fillings show ed 
significantly higher degradation efficiencies at al l pH ranges studied. This greater ability of cast iron to degra de Orange II 
could be attributed to the presence of graphite inc lusions 
embedded in the iron matrix which serves as anon-re active 
adsorption site[9,20,21]. Thus, adsorption and redu ction takes 
place simultaneously on cast iron surface.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, the parameters affecting the reductiv e 
degradation of Orange II dye were investigated. Alt hough cast 
iron particles were found to be capable of degradin g more than 
90 % of Orange II at all pH examined within 5 min o f 
treatment time, optimum degradation efficiency of 9 7.63% 
was achieved at pH 3 after 60 min. More than 50% dy e 
degradation was achieved at all cast iron dosages w ithin 5 min 
and the efficiencies exceeded 90% at all dosages af ter 40 min. 
At all the initial Orange II dye concentration stud ied, more 
than 95% degradation efficiencies could be achieved  using 
cast iron dosage of 28.56 g/L. This indicates that cast iron can 
be effective even at the wide range of dye concentr ation in 
textile effluent. Comparative assessment of degrada tion 
efficiencies of cast iron and pure elemental iron r eveals greater 
capability of cast iron to treat dye containing was tewater.Apart 
from the experimental results, the fact that cast i ron is 
available at a fraction of the cost of the high pur ity iron makes 
it a more ideal cost effective alternative for prac tical treatment 
applications.
