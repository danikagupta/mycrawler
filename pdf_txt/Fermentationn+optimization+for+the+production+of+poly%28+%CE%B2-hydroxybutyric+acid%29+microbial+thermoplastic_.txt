The  practicality  of  using  sugarbeet  juice  as  medium  to  grow  Alcaligenes  latus  (ATCC  29714)  for  production
of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic, was explored in this study. Dilute sugarbeet juice,
sugarbeet juice  with  partial  and  complete  addition  of  nutrients  other  than  sugar  were  used  as  culture
media. Media with partial nutrient addition was shown to be optimal for PHB production, with ﬁnal dry
cell weight  (DCW)  10.30  ±  1.01  g/L,  PHB  concentration  4.01  ±  0.95  g/L,  PHB  content  38.66  ±  7.28%,  Yp/x
(g  PHB  produced  per  g  dry  cell  weight)  0.39  ±  0.07  and  a  maximum  PHB  productivity  of  0.22  ±  0.01  g/L  h.
The melting  temperature  of  PHB  extracted  from  sugarbeet  juice-grown  cells  supplemented  with  partial
nutrients was measured to be 151.46◦C  with  crystallinity  of  43.12%  and  the  corresponding  crystallinity
temperature of  45.42◦C.  Thermal  degradation  of  extracted  PHB  occurred  from  255.14  to  283.69◦C  with
the degradation peak at 273.86◦C.

1.  Introduction
The use  of  plastics  has  increased  signiﬁcantly  in  recent  years
and  its  application  has  permeated  most  aspects  of  human  life  and
industrial  production  (Yu  et  al.,  1998 ).  The  dominant  raw  mate-
rial  for current plastic production is petroleum (Yezza et al., 2007 ),
which is  nonrenewable  and  also  the  main  source  of  energy  for  the
world.  Limited future availability of petroleum, increasing price of
fossil  fuel and environmental and waste management concerns
due  to  non-biodegradability  of  conventional  plastics  have  thus
driven  various  entities  to  look  for  more  sustainable  alternatives
such  as polyhydryalkanoates (PHAs), polylactides (PLA), aliphatic
polyesters,  polysaccharides,  blends  of  starch  and  polypropylene
and  other  copolymers  (Lee,  1996 )  to  replace  petro-derived  plastics
(Yu  et al., 1999 ).
Of  the various biodegradable plastics being investigated to
replace  petroleum-derived  plastics,  polyhydroxyalkanoates  (PHA),
especially  polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB),  have  received  special
attention  due to some mechanical properties that make them com-
parable  to  commercialized  plastics  such  as  polypropylene  (PP)  and
polyethylene  (PE)  (Yu,  2001 ).  PHB  is  well-known  for  its  environ-
mental  friendliness and complete decomposition to water and

or  soil  (Lee,  1996 ).  Key  applications  for  PHB  include  packaging
materials,  bags,  containers,  disposable  items  like  one-time  use  cups
and  diapers  (Lee,  1996 ).  It  also  has  medical  applications,  either
in  surgical  materials  or  as  a  slow-release  carrier  for  long-term
drug  delivery (Patwardhan and Srivastava, 2004 ).The main obstacle
limiting wide  spread  commercialization  of  PHB  is  its  high  produc-
tion  cost, which at present is approximately 10 times higher than
conventional  synthetic polymers (Wegen et al., 1998 ) and accounts
for  up  to  50%  of  the  processing  cost  (Choi  and  Lee,  1999 ).  Corn
is  a  common  feedstock  currently  used  by  various  companies  like
Cargill  Dow Polymers, LLC for biopolymer production (Lunt, 2000 ).
Besides  being  a  major  food  and  feed  source  in  many  regions  of  the
world,  corn  is  priced  at  $269/metric  ton  (USDA,  2011a,b ).  Thus,
using  cheaper feedstocks is the key to reducing production cost
of  PHB (Khanna and Srivastava, 2005 ).
Soy  wastes  from  soy  milk  processing  facilities,  malt  wastes
from  beer  breweries,  agro-industrial  waste  water,  extruded  rice
bran,  hydrolyzed corn starch and whey from dairy processing
are  some  resources  that  have  been  investigated  for  sustainable
production  of  biodegradable  plastics  (Gomez  et  al.,  1996;  Huang
et  al., 2006; Khardenavis et al., 2007; Yang et al., 1994; Yezza et al.,
2007;  Yu et al., 1999 ). The potential of sugarbeet, a sucrose-rich
and  sustainable  biomass  that  is  cultivated  globally,  has  also  been
investigated  (Page,  1989,  1992 ).  Sugarbeet  acreage  in  the  US  has
increased  steadily  and  estimated  at  1.25  million  acres  (NASS,
0926-6690/$ – see front matter ©  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.011B.  Wang  et  al.  /  Industrial  Crops  and  Products  43 (2013) 802–  811 803
2010 )  with  the  world-wide  annual  production  of  sugarbeets
estimated  at  227  million  tons  in  2009  (FAO  Statistics,  2009 ).
The  leading  sugarbeet  producing  countries  include  France,  USA,
Germany,  and  Russia  (FAO  Statistics,  2009 ).  Sucrose  content
of  dry  sugarbeet  powders  can  reach  up  to  80%  and  it  contains
nutrients  such  as  N,  P,  K  and  Na  which  makes  it  highly  suitable  for
microbial  cultivation  (OECD,  2002 ).  Page  (1989,  1992)  investigated
downstream  products  of  beet  sugar  industry  such  as  molasses
and  pulps  for  PHB  production  using  Azotobacter  vinelandii  strain
UWD.  PHB  concentration  using  molasses  was  however  lower
than  (2.74  g/L  vs.  7.04  g/L)  that  reported  using  sucrose-based
synthetic  media  with  fermentation  by  Alcaligenes  latus  (El-Sayed
et  al.,  2009 )  and  thus  calls  for  further  investigation.  Utilization  of
sugarbeet  juice  as  a  medium  for  PHB  production  offers  a  signiﬁcant
cost  advantage  ($61/ton  sugarbeet  (USDA,  2011a,b ))  especially
when  compared  to  pure  sugars  or  currently  used  starch  based
feedstocks.  However,  there  is  no  literature  on  strain  selection  and
media  optimization  as  well  as  process  development  in  order  to
improve  PHB  production  using  sugarbeets  to  make  them  suitable
for  industrial  applications.  Therefore,  this  research  focused  on
investigating  the  potential  of  sugarbeet  juice  based  media,  with
varying  supplemental  nutrient  concentrations,  for  PHB  production
in  a  two-stage  batch  fermentation  process  involving  A.  latus.
Fermentation  process  time  was  optimized  by  monitoring  PHB
production  parameters  like  yield,  content  and  concentration.  A.
latus  is  a  growth  associated  PHB  producer  that  has  been  reported
to  use  sucrose  as  carbon  source  to  produce  PHB  and  was  selected
due  to  its  ability  to  accumulate  up  to  80%  of  dry  cell  mass  as
PHB  (Braunegg  and  Bogensberger,  1985 ).
2.  Materials  and  methods
2.1. Microorganisms
An  intracellular  PHB  producing  microorganism,  A.  latus  (ATCC
29714),  purchased  from  American  Type  Culture  Collection  (ATCC)
was  used  in  this  study.  Selection  of  the  strain  was  based  on  results
of  a  previous  study  by  Wang  et  al.  (2012) .
2.2. Media  preparation
A  variety  of  media  types  were  used  at  various  stages  in  this
study.
Med. 1:  DifcoTMNutrient  agar  (Becton,  Dickinson  and  Company,
MD,  USA) was used to maintain A. latus (El-Sayed et al., 2009 ).
Med.  2:  Media  to  prepare  A.  latus  inoculum  for  subsequent
PHB  production  using  sugarbeet  juice  contained  the  following
components  (El-Sayed  et  al.,  2009 ):  sucrose  20  g/L,  (NH 4)2SO4
2.0  g/L,  KH 2PO41.5  g/L,  Na2HPO 4·12H 2O  9  g/L,  MgSO 4·7H2O  0.2  g/L,
FeCl 2·H2O  60  mg/L,  CaCl 2·2H2O  10  mg/L,  and  1  mL  of  ﬁlter  steril-
ized  trace  elements  solution.  Each  liter  of  trace  element  solution
contained  H3BO30.3  g,  CoCl 2·6H2O  0.2  g,  ZnSO 4·7H2O  0.1  g,
MnC1 2·4H2O  30  mg,  Na2MoO 4·2H2O  30  mg,  NiSO4·7H2O  28  mg  and
CuSO 4·5H2O  10  mg.  The  pH  of  formulated  media  was  7.0  (unad-
justed)  as  reported  by  El-Sayed  et  al.  (2009) .
Med.  3 (no nutrient addition): sugarbeet juice obtained by
extraction  of  sugarbeets  under  conditions  identiﬁed  as  optimum  in
this  study  was  diluted  with  deionized  water  to  adjust  the  sucrose
concentration  to 20 g/L. The same media was used both at stage 1
and stage 2. The pH of this media was 7.03 ± 0.05 (unadjusted).
Med. 4 (complete nutrient addition ): sugarbeet juice with sucrose
concentration adjusted to 20 g/L (Med. 3) was supplemented
with  all  the  nutrients  identiﬁed  in  Med.  2  (except  sucrose)  per
liter of diluted sugarbeet juice for stage 1 fermentation. For the
2nd  stage,  only  0.2  g/L  (NH 4)2SO4,  which  was  equivalent  to  10%Table  1

7.11  ±  0.04  (unadjusted)  for  ﬁrst  stage  and  7.08  ±  0.04  (unadjusted)
for  second  stage.
Med.  5  (partial  nutrient  addition ):  sugarbeet  juice  with  sucrose
concentration  adjusted  to  20  g/L  (Med.  3)  was  supplemented  with:
(NH 4)2SO41.97  g/L  (nitrogen  rich  media  for  ﬁrst  stage)  or  0.17  g/L
(nitrogen  limited media for second stage); Na2HPO 4·12H 2O  8.6  g/L;
KH 2PO40.94  g/L;  FeCl 2·H2O  57.84  mg/L  and  1  mL  of  ﬁlter  steril-

0.01  g/L  per  1  L  sugarbeet  juice.  The  level  of  nutrients  to  be  added
was  based on elemental analysis of Med. 3 (Table 1). When levels
of inherent components were higher in Med. 3, the corresponding
salt was not added. In other cases the difference between amount
of salts  added  in  Med.  2  and  those  present  in  Med.  3  was  used  to
estimate  the  amount  needed  for  partial  addition.  The  pH  of  this
media  was  7.22  ±  0.04  (unadjusted)  for  ﬁrst  stage  and  7.24  ±  0.04
(unadjusted)  for second stage.
2.3. Extraction of sugar from sugarbeets
Fresh sugarbeets harvested from Custer area of Montana were
sliced and  dried  in  a  convection  oven  (Fisher  Scientiﬁc)  at  60◦C
for  25 h. The dried slices were stored at 4◦C  in  a  temperature  con-
trolled  chamber  during  the  course  of  the  study.  The  slices  were
ground  to  pass  through  a  2  mm  sieve  using  a  Wiley  Mill  for  extrac-
tion.  Sugarbeet powder and deionized water were mixed at a solid
loading  of  1:15  (sugarbeet  (w):water  (w)),  and  placed  in  a  shak-
ing  water  bath  (Precision,  Thermo  Scientiﬁc)  at  60◦C/150  rpm  for
1  h to generate 4000 mL sugarbeet juice extract for use during fer-
mentation studies. Extraction conditions were identiﬁed as optimal
based on preliminary studies (data was not shown) looking at solid:
water ratio, extraction time, and sugarbeet preparation (fresh vs.
oven  dry)  for  samples  harvested  from  Plymouth,  NC  in  September,
2009. After vacuum ﬁltration, the sugarbeet juice based media was
obtained.804 B.  Wang  et  al.  /  Industrial  Crops  and  Products  43 (2013) 802–  811
Sugar  concentration  was  measured  in◦Brix  by  a  refractometer
(Alla  France).  Brix  values  were  converted  to  grams  of  sugar,  using
Eq.  (1)  (Bruce,  1995 ):
SCg=  SC  ×  SG  ×  10  (1)
where,
 SC  was  sugar  concentration  in◦Brix  and  SCgrepresented
sugar  concentration  in  g/L.  Speciﬁc  gravity  (SG)  under  different
◦Brix  was  obtained  from  the  sucrose  conversion  table  (USDA,  1981 )
and  10  was  the  conversion  factor.
2.4. Inoculum  preparation
Thirty  mL  of  Med.  2  in  three  250  mL  ﬂasks  was  inoculated  with
1.5  mL  thawed  A.  latus  ATCC  29714  glycerol  (20%)  stock  and  incu-
bated  at  33◦C  for  24  h,  for  propagation  of  frozen  stocks  prior  to
starting  each  stage  of  the  study.  Two  and  a  half  mL  of  inoculum
(Santhanam  and Sasidharan, 2010 ) was added to 100 mL sugarbeet
media for the actual fermentation process.
2.5. Fermentation  of  sugarbeet  juice  for  PHB  production
Based on the results of a previous study (Wang et al., 2012 ), two-
stage batch fermentation with introduction of N limitation at 16 h
by  replacing  spent  N  rich  sucrose  based  media  with  fresh  N  limited
media  (10%  N  of  original)  was  identiﬁed  as  optimal  for  this  study.
Sugarbeet  juice  prepared  as  described  above  had  an  average  sucrose
concentration  of approx. 50 g/L, which was much higher than that
normally  used  for  A.  latus  cultivation  (Yamane  et  al.,  1996;  Grothe
et  al.,  1999 ).  Thus,  the  sugarbeet  juice  was  diluted  as  needed  with
deionized  water  to  the  desired  concentration  (20  g/L).
Fermentation  studies  were  conducted  with  no  additional  nutri-
ents (Med. 3), complete nutrient addition (Med. 4) and partial
nutrient  addition  (Med.  5)  to  determine  PHB  production  potential
of  the  juice.  Hundred  mL  of  desired  media  (Med.  3,  Med.  4  or  Med.  5)
was  added to 250 mL polypropylene centrifuge bottles with plastic
foam  stoppers  (3  media  types  ×  3  replicates  ×  12  sample  points).
Each  bottle  was  inoculated  with  2.5  mL  A.  latus  inoculum  and  incu-
bated  at 33◦C  in  the  incubator  shaker  (Series  25;  New  Brunswick
Scientiﬁc  Co., Inc., Edison, New Jersey, USA) at 200 rpm. Three bot-
tles  each  were  drawn  at  4,  8,  12  and  16  h.  After  16  h  of  the  ﬁrst
stage,  the  remaining  bottles  were  centrifuged  at  4000  rpm/30◦C
for  10 min and residual media decanted. For N limited stage (stage
2),  100  mL  of  Med.  3  was  added  to  the  no  additional  nutrient  set,
Med.  4  with  10%  of  N  compared  to  1st  stage  was  added  to  the  com-
plete  nutrient  addition  set  and  Med.  5  with  10%  of  N  was  added  to
the  partial nutrient addition set. After changing to new media, the
remaining  bottles  were  incubated  at  33◦C,  200  rpm  in  an  incubator
shaker  for  up  to  28  h.  As  during  the  ﬁrst  stage,  three  bottles  each
were  taken out at 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 26, 27, 28 h from start of second
stage  for  subsequent  analyses.
2.6. PHB  extraction  and  quantiﬁcation
The  method  used  for  PHB  extraction  and  quantiﬁcation  was
adapted  from  the  gravimetric  method  of  Kim  et  al.  (1994) .  A  mix-
ture  of sodium hypochlorite (12.5 mL, 30% (v/v)) and chloroform
(12.5  mL)  with  1  g  dry  cell  mass  in  50  mL  centrifuge  bottles  was
vortexed  and  kept  in  a  water  bath  at  30◦C  for  90  min.  It  was
then  centrifuged  for  15  min,  4000  rpm  (Eppendorf  5810  R,  Eppen-
dorf  AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 30◦C.  Of  the  three  layers  formed,
top  (aqueous  hypochlorite  solution),  middle  (cells,  other  biolog-
ical  matter),  and  bottom  (PHB  rich  chloroform),  the  chloroform
phase  was  pipetted  out  carefully  and  PHB  was  recovered  by  non-
solvent precipitation using a mixture of methanol:water (7:3 (v/v),
1.25  mL/g  dry  cell  mass)  and  ﬁltration.  The  extraction  mixture  inuncapped
 tubes  was  left  in  a  fume  hood  for  48  h  to  volatilize  excess
solvent.  The  ﬁnal  PHB  pellet  obtained  was  weighed  and  the  yield
of  PHB  estimated.
2.7.
 Analytical  procedures
2.7.1.  Optical  density  (OD)  and  dry  cell  weight  (DCW)
Optical  density  (OD)  of  the  suitably  diluted  cell  suspension  was
measured by  a  spectrophotometer  (Shimadzu  UV-1700,  Suzhou
Instruments  Manufacturing  Co.,  Ltd.,  Suzhou,  China)  at  600  nm
against  a  media  blank.  Dry  cell  weight  was  evaluated  by  a  gravi-
metric  method  in  which  fermentation  samples  were  centrifuged
(4000  rpm,  15  min,  4◦C),  decanted  and  dried  in  an  oven  (90◦C)  until
constant  weight  was  reached.  The  samples  were  then  cooled  in  a
desiccator  and  weighed  to  determine  DCW.
2.7.2.
 Elemental analysis
Elemental  analysis  including  determination  of  N,  Ca,  Co,  Cu,  K,
Mg,  Mn,  Ni  and  Zn  in  sugarbeet  juice  was  performed  by  soil  anal-
ysis  lab in the department of Soil Science at North Carolina State
University and  Iron  (II)  measurement  was  done  by  environmental
analysis  lab  in  the  department  of  Biological  and  Agricultural  Engi-
neering.  Iron  (II)  was  measured  by  nitric  acid  digestion  followed
by  direct  aspiration  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  based  on  the
standard  method 3111-B of American Public Health Association,
American  Water  Works  Association  and  Water  Environment  Fed-
eration  (Clesceri  et  al.,  1998 ).  For  inorganic  nitrogen  measurement,
standard  method  4500-NH3H  provided  by  Greenberg  et  al.  (2005)
was  applied. Standard method 3120 was used for the detection of
other  metals (Greenberg et al., 2005 ).
2.7.3.
 Sugar  analysis  using  ion  chromatography  (IC)
An IC  (Dionex  ICS-5000,  California,  USA)  equipped  with  a  pulsed
electrochemical  detector  (Dionex  ICS-5000)  was  used  to  measure
the  sugar concentration of fermentation broth samples. The col-
umn  used  was  CarboPac  PA1  (4  ×  250  mm)  with  eluent  (18  mM
potassium  hydroxide)  at  a  ﬂow  rate  of  0.9  mL/min  and  working
temperature  18◦C.
Samples  in  250  mL  bottles  were  centrifuged  and  the  super-
natant  obtained  was  diluted  50  times  before  ﬁltering  through
0.22  /H9262m  syringe  ﬁlters  into  vials  with  pre-split  caps.  Concentra-
tions  of sucrose, glucose and fructose were recorded for each
sample. A  stock  solution  containing  0.5  g  each  of  sucrose,  fruc-
tose  and glucose in 200 mL HPLC grade water was prepared in
a  volumetric ﬂask. The standards were prepared by gradient
dilution  to  obtain  sugar  concentrations  of  0.5  g/L,  0.25  g/L,  0.125
and  0.0625  g/L.
2.7.4.
 Confocal imaging of inclusion bodies of A. latus ATCC 29714
Five /H9262l each  of  broth  from  fermentation  runs  resulting  in
enhanced  PHB  production  by  A.  latus  ATCC  29714  in  synthetic  and
sugarbeet  juice  media  were  placed  on  a  slide  and  dried  in  an  incu-
bator  overnight at 33◦C  (Ostle  and  Holt,  1982 ).  The  slide  was  then
immersed  in 1% Nile blue A aqueous solution in a shallow container
and  stained  for  40  min  by  placing  in  a  shaking  incubator  (55◦C,
50  rpm).  The  slide  was  dried  again  before  5  /H9262l  of  water  was  put  on
it  and  a  cover  slip  placed  over  it.

NY,  USA)  with  Zeiss  Axio  Observer  Z1  inverted  microscope  and
Zeiss  Plan  Apochromat  63×  objectives  (NA  1.4  oil  immersion)  was
used  to obtain images of inclusion bodies of A. latus at the Cel-
lular  and  Molecular  Imaging  Facility  (CMIF)  in  the  Department
of  Plant  Biology.  The  inclusion  bodies  were  excited  at  488  nm
(argon  laser) and ﬂuorescence emission was determined from

2.7.5. PHB identiﬁcation using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS)
Samples for GC analysis were prepared as described by Riis and
Mai (1988) . Forty mg each of dry cell mass obtained from fermenta-
tion using  synthetic  media  (Wang  et  al.,  2012 )  and  sugarbeet  juice
media,  both resulting in optimized PHB production were placed in
50  mL  sealable  glass  centrifuge  tubes.  Two  mL  1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE),  2  mL  propanol  mixed  solution  (1  volume  hydrochloric  acid
and  4 volume propanol) and 200 /H9262l of  internal  standard  solution
(prepared  by adding 2.0 g benzoic acid in 50 mL propanol) were
added  to  each  tube.  The  tubes  were  incubated  in  a  convection  oven
for  2  h  at  100◦C  and  shaken  once  every  30  min.  After  cooling  the
tubes  to room temperature, 4 mL DI water was added and the tubes
were  shaken  for  30  s  before  allowing  to  gravity  settle.  The  bottom
organic  phase  was  directly  injected  into  the  GC–MS.  Standards  were
prepared  by dissolving 200 mg PHB, extracted from dry cell mass
of  the optimized synthetic media fermentation conditions (Wang
et  al.,  2012 ),  in  DCE  in  a  10  mL  volumetric  ﬂask  placed  at  100◦C  for
2  h.  Upon  cooling,  the  solution  was  made  up  to  10  mL  by  adding
DCE.  Two  hundred  /H9262l,  400  /H9262l,  600  /H9262l  and  800  /H9262l  of  this  mixture
were  taken  and  treated  in  the  same  way  with  propanol  and  benzoic
acid  as  mentioned  above.
GC  analysis for conﬁrming the presence of PHB in fermen-
tation  broth was conducted at mass spectrometry laboratory
in  the  department  of  Chemistry  at  NCSU.  An  Agilent  5975
GC–MS  in  electron  ionization  (EI)  mode  equipped  with  a  HP-
5MS  30  m  ×  250  /H9262m  ×  0.25  /H9262m  column  with  helium  at  a  ﬂow  of
1  mL/min  was  used.  Initial  temperature  of  50◦C  was  held  for  3  min
before  ramping  to  325◦C  at  15◦C/min  and  holding  for  5  min.  A  3  min
solvent  delay  was  used.
2.7.6. Rheological  analysis  of  PHB
Rheological properties of PHB samples obtained from fermenta-
tion of sugarbeet juice were analyzed. Sample discs for rheological
analysis were  prepared  using  a  Carver®Press  (CH-4386,  Wabash,
IN,  USA) in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer-
ing. A 25 mm die wrapped with polyimide ﬁlm to prevent sticking
was ﬁlled with 0.7 g extracted PHB and pressed twice at room tem-
perature, molded at 140◦C  by  sequentially  pressing  the  dies  under
1–9  tons  and  releasing  pressure/wt  immediately  after  each  applica-
tion. In the end pressure was held for 2 min before cooling to room
temperature.Dynamic
 rheological  experiments  were  conducted  using  an
AR2000  Advanced  Rheometer  (TA  Instruments,  DE,  USA)  ﬁtted  with
25  mm  ETC  ﬂat  plate  geometry.  First,  stress  sweep  experiment  was
performed  to  evaluate  the  maximum  stress  within  the  linear  vis-
coelastic  (LVE) region. Then frequency sweep was conducted in the
predetermined  LVE region. All experiments were done at 180◦C.
2.7.7. Differential  scanning  calorimeter  (DSC)  and
thermogravimetric  analysis (TG)
The  melting  temperature  and  crystallinity  of  PHB  obtained  from
fermentation  using  sugarbeet  juice  media  resulting  in  enhanced
production  was determined in the department of Textile Engineer-
ing, Chemistry  and  Science  by  Diamond  DSC  (PERKIN  ELMER,  Inc.,
USA)  equipped  with  Intracooler  2P.  Two  heating  and  cooling  scan
cycles  were  performed  within  the  temperature  range  from  −20  to
220◦C  at  a  scanning  rate  of  10◦C/min.  The  information  on  ther-
mal  history  of  PHB  samples  was  obtained  from  the  ﬁrst  cycle  and
the  melting  temperature  (Tm),  crystallinity  temperature  (Tc)  and
enthalpy  of  fusion  (/Delta1H)  were  determined  from  the  second  cycle.
The  crystallinity of PHB samples was calculated as the ratio of /Delta1H
from  this study to the /Delta1H corresponding with 100% crystallinity.
The  /Delta1H  corresponding  to  100%  crystallinty  of  PHB  was  assumed  to
be  146  J/g  based  on  that  reported  by  Barham  et  al.  (1984) .
TG  analysis was conduct using Pyris 1 TGA (PERKIN ELMER, Inc.,
USA)  with  a  temperature  scanning  rate  of  20◦C/min  from  0  to  700◦C
under  nitrogen  (ﬂow  rate  of  60  mL/min),  to  further  examine  the
degradation  process of PHB samples (Yezza et al., 2007 ).
2.8.  Process  parameters  and  statistical  analysis
All experiments  and  analyses  were  performed  in  triplicate.  Opti-
cal  density (OD), dry cell weight (DCW), PHB yield coefﬁcient
relative to cell dry weight (Yp/x,  g/g,  deﬁned  as  gram  PHB  pro-
duced  per gram dry cell mass produced) (Grothe et al., 1999 ),
PHB content  (g/g,  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  PHB  concentration  to  dry
cell  concentration) and PHB productivity (g/L h, deﬁned as gram
PHB produced per liter per hour) (Wang and Lee, 1997 ) were
measured and calculated accordingly for comparison of different
media performances after completion of the fermentation pro-
cess.  SAS®procedure  MIXED  (version  9.1.3  SP4,  SAS  Inc.,  Cary,
NC) was applied to ﬁt the experimental data into a general lin-
ear  model.  Sampling  time,  media  type  and  their  interaction  were806 B.  Wang  et  al.  /  Industrial  Crops  and  Products  43 (2013) 802–  811
treated  as  ﬁxed  effects  in  the  model.  Separate  residual  variances
were  estimated  for  each  sampling  point  to  account  for  hetero-
geneity  of  residual  variances.  The  three  repetitions  for  media  type
and  sampling  time  combination  were  seen  as  random  effects.
Pairwise  Student- t  test  (˛  =  0.05)  was  used  to  further  test  null
hypothesis  of  no  differences  among  groups.  Test  of  hypothesis  for
main  and  interaction  effects  were  conducted  at  0.05  signiﬁcance
level.
3.  Results
3.1. Elemental  analysis  of  sugarbeet  juice
Elemental  analysis  data  for  synthetic  media  (Med.  2)  used  in
PHB  production  by  A.  latus  and  sugarbeet  juice  based  media  (Med.
3)  is  presented  in  Table  1.  The  concentration  of  elements  was  con-
verted  to that of chemicals to make it more convenient to determine
the level  of  nutrient  addition  required  for  partial  nutrient  addi-
tion  based media (Med. 5). The results indicated that for trace
elements  such  as  Co,  Cu  and  Ni,  the  amount  was  below  the  mea-
surement  range  (<0.05  mg/L)  of  methods  used.  Although  N,  Na  and
Fe  were present in sugarbeet juice, the amounts were not enough
compared to  those  in  synthetic  media,  e.g.,  25.93  ±  11.90  mg/L
equivalent  of  (NH 4)2SO4was  present  in  Med.  3  compared  to
2000  mg/L  required  for  nitrogen  rich  and  200  mg/L  for  nitrogen
limited  Med. 2. The differences (1974.07 mg/L for nitrogen rich
media  and  174.07  mg/L  for  nitrogen  limited  media)  were  the
amount  of  corresponding  salt  added  in  Med.  5.  Nutrients  like  Ca,
Mg  and Mn were in excess amounts in the natural media and hence
did  not need to be added during fermentation with partial salt
addition.

PHB  production  from  sugarbeet  juice
Fig. 1  presents  the  growth  curves  of  A.  latus  (ATCC  29714)
during  the  ﬁrst  stage  (16  h)  for  the  three  media  tested.  A.  latus
showed  exponential  growth  under  all  three  nutrient  addition
strategies.  Media with partial addition resulted in the highest DCW
of  7.95  ±  1.25  g/L,  while  the  corresponding  DCWs  with  no  nutrient
addition  media  and  complete  addition  media  were  4.75  ±  0.05  g/L
and  4.07  ±  0.23  g/L,  respectively.

are  shown  in  Table  2.  DCW  data  indicated  that  the  exponential
growth  phase  was  extended  for  all  three  nutrient  supplemen-
tation  runs.  The  run  using  partial  nutrient  addition  ended  at  the
highest  DCW  of  10.30  ±  1.01  g/L  while  DCWs  were  9.23  ±  0.06  g/L

respectively,  and  0.31  ±  0.12  g/L  with  complete  nutrient  addi-
tion.  PHB  productivity  ranged  from  0.10  to  0.13  g/L  h,  0.05  to
0.09  g/L  h  and  0.12  to  0.22  g/L  h  for  no  nutrient  addition,  com-
plete  nutrient  addition  and  partial  nutrient  addition,  respectively.

Both  parameters  showed  an  increasing  trend  with  ending  values
generally  within  2.39  ±  0.78  g/L  and  31.01  ±  11.81%  for  complete
nutrient  addition  and  4.01  ±  0.95  g/L  and  38.66  ±  7.28%  for  par-

tial  addition  fermentations,  respectively.  During  the  second  stage,

3.3.  Identiﬁcation  of  PHB  using  confocal  microscope  and  gas
chromatography–mass  spectrometry (GC–MS)
Inclusion bodies  in  cells  from  fermentation  broth  of  synthetic
media  and  sugarbeet  juice  media  with  partial  nutrient  addition
were  visually examined using confocal microscopy. PHB inclusion
bodies  can be distinguished in all the cells which appear as green
ﬂuorescence  (Fig.  3).  The  images  in  this  study  were  similar  to  the
ones  taken  by  Ostle  and  Holt  (1982) ,  for  PHB  granules  in  A.  chroococ-
cum  stained  with  Nile  blue  A.  The  size  (∼2  /H9262m  in  diameter  and
2.5  /H9262m  in  length)  and  shape  of  A.  latus  is  consistent  with  that
observed  by  Palleroni  and  Palleroni  (1978)  and  Holt  et  al.  (1994) .
Visual  estimation  of  the  percentage  of  cells  with  PHB  inclusion  bod-
ies  is  approximately  50%  for  synthetic  media  and  40%  for  sugarbeet
juice  media.PHB
 obtained  by  both  synthetic  and  sugarbeet  juice  media  with
partial  nutrient  addition  was  conﬁrmed  by  GC–MS  analysis.  In  the
chromatograms  shown  in  Fig.  4,  three  main  peaks  with  similar
retention  times  can  be  seen.  As  identiﬁed  by  comparing  molecules
in  the  GC  database,  the  ﬁrst  peak  represents  the  solvent  used  during
sample  preparation  (DCE  and  propanol),  the  second  peak  denotes
hydroxybutyric  acid  propyl  ester  and  the  third  represents  benzoic
acid  propyl  ester.  The  sequence  of  components  represented  by  the
3  peaks  in  the  chromatographs  is  in  accordance  with  that  reported
by  Riis  and  Mai  (1988) .  Based  on  the  peak  area,  PHB  content  in  dry
cell  mass  was  determined  to  be  80.15%  and  65.60%  for  synthetic
and  sugarbeet  juice  media,  respectively.
3.4.
 Rheology  of  PHB  produced  by  sugarbeet  juice  fermentation
Rheological properties  of  PHB  samples  were  examined  in  terms
of  their  dynamic  elastic  (G/prime)  and  (G/prime/prime)  viscous  moduli.  In  Fig.  5a,  we
examine  the  frequency  dependence  of  G/primeand  G/prime/primeof  a  representative
sample  (from  partial  nutrient  addition  fermentation),  as  the  rela-
tive  shape  and  magnitude  of  the  moduli  provide  a  signature  of  the
molecular  interactions in the system (Raghavan et al., 2000 ). This
experiment was  carried  out  at  a  stress  within  the  linear  viscoelastic
region  (3 Pa) of the sample obtained from stress sweep experiment
(Fig.  5b)  (Gunasekaran  and  Mehmet,  2003 ).  Fig.  5b  shows  the  effect
of  increasing  stress  on  the  two  moduli.  This  experiment  was  carried
out  at  a  constant  frequency  of  ω  =  1  rad/s,  and  was  done  to  examine
the  effect  of  stress  on  microstructural  breakdown.
3.5.
 Thermal  properties  of  PHB  produced  by  sugarbeet  juice
fermentation
PHB  samples  extracted  from  A.  latus  cells  obtained  from  fer-
mentation  of  sugarbeet  juice  with  partial  nutrient  addition  were
analyzed  for  thermal  properties.  Based  on  results  of  differential
scanning  colorimetery, the peak representing melting point of PHB
in  the  ﬁrst  scan  appeared  at  165.15◦C  and  the  corresponding  crys-
tallization  temperature  was  66.28◦C.  The  enthalpy  of  fusion  was
61.161  J/g  and  crystallinity  during  melting  in  the  ﬁrst  cycle  was
calculated  as  41.89%.  In  the  second  scan,  the  melting  point  peak
appeared  at  151.46◦C  with  the  crystallization  peak  at  45.42◦C.  The
corresponding  enthalpy  of  fusion  was  62.962  J/g  and  crystallinity
during  melting was calculated as 43.12%.
According  to  thermogravimetric  analysis  (Fig.  6),  the  tempera-
ture  range  for  rapid  thermal  degradation  of  PHB  was  from  255.14
to  283.69◦C  with  the  degradation  peaking  at  273.86◦C  (the  only
large  inverted  peak).  The  total  weight  loss  within  this  temperature
range  was  95.39%.

 Discussion
Elemental analysis  of  sugarbeet  juice  indicated  that  in  its  nat-
ural  form  it  is  a  highly  complex  mixture  of  nutrients  suitable  for
PHB  fermentation.  Investigation  on  exploring  inhibition/promotion
effect  and  optimal  nutrient  addition  strategies  was  thus  essential
to  establish the foundation for the future application and develop-
ment  of sugarbeet juice in PHB production.
4.1.
 Effect of different nutrient supplementation strategies on
PHB  production  from  sugarbeet  juice
Based on  statistical  analysis  (ANOVA  GLM  with  ˛  =  0.05),  DCW
data  obtained  from  the  end  of  ﬁrst  stage  (16  h)  for  each  nutri-
ent  addition  strategy  showed  no  signiﬁcant  difference  (P  >  0.05)
between  no  addition  and  complete  addition  fermentation.  How-
ever,  partial  nutrient  addition  resulted  in  signiﬁcantly  higher
(P  ≤  0.05)  DCW.  When  growth  of  A.  latus  within  24  h  (data  not808 B.  Wang  et  al.  /  Industrial  Crops  and  Products  43 (2013) 802–  811

shown)  was  compared  among  the  three  nutrient  addition  strate-
gies,  although  DCW  from  fermentation  of  media  with  complete
nutrient  addition  was  low  in  the  initial  stage,  all  three  media  types
showed  no  signiﬁcant  (P  >  0.05)  difference  in  DCW  at  the  end  of
the  growth  period.  It  was  observed  that  they  all  entered  stationary
growth  after  16  h.
According  to  statistical  analysis  using  mixed  analysis  (Type  3
Tests  of  Fixed  Effects,  ˛  =  0.05),  when  data  for  all  the  parameters
(DCW,  PHB  concentration,  PHB  content,  Yp/x,  PHB  productivity)  and
sampling  time  points  (4,  8,  12,  20,  24,  26,  27,  28  h  after  changing  the
media)  for  second  stage  was  included,  different  nutrient  addition
strategies  had  a  signiﬁcant  effect  (P  ≤  0.05)  on  PHB  production,  as
shown  in  Table  3.
Mixed  analysis  (˛  =  0.05)  conducted  to  see  the  differences
among  three  nutrient  addition  strategies  showed  the  same  result
for  DCW  and  PHB  content  such  that  there  was  no  signiﬁcant  differ-
ence  (P  >  0.05)  between  no  addition  and  partial  addition  samples.
However,  they  were  both  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  fermentations
with  complete  addition.  For  PHB  concentration  and  productiv-
ity,  fermentations  with  all  three  nutrient  addition  strategies  gave
signiﬁcantly  different  (P  ≤  0.05)  results.  The  highest  value  was
obtained  from  partial  nutrient  addition  followed  by  no  nutrient
addition.  It  is  believed  that  complete  nutrient  addition  may  have
had  an  inhibitory  effect  during  fermentation  due  to  excess  nutri-
ents.
Partial nutrient  addition  gave  the  overall  best  performance  on
PHB  production  among  the  three  media  types.  For  fermentation
with  partial  nutrient  addition,  there  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference
in  the  values  of  various  parameters  (DCW,  PHB  concentration,  PHB
content,  Yp/xand  PHB  productivity)  among  the  samples  taken  at
26  h, 27 h and 28 h during second stage but a signiﬁcant jump in
PHB  concentration  was  observed  between  24  h  and  26  h.  There-
fore,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  optimized  two-stage  fermentation
strategy  for  using  sugarbeet  juice  to  produce  PHB  involves  using
partial  nutrient  addition  media  (Med.  5)  with  the  second  stage
ending  at  26  h.  It  is  noteworthy  that  PHB  content  and  productiv-
ity  were  comparable  while  DCW  and  PHB  concentration  obtained
with  fermentation  of  sugarbeet  juice  supplemented  partially  with
nutrients  were higher than those from the fermentation using syn-
thetic  media under optimized fermentation conditions (Wang et al.,
2012 ).
Results of  PHB  production  obtained  from  partial  nutrient  addi-
tion  were  comparable  with  other  renewable  feedstocks  and  even
enhanced  in  spite  of  the  smaller  scale  and  shorter  overall  processing
time  investigated  in  this  study.  Compared  to  the  research  by  Yezza
et  al. (2007) , which used maple sap as media for PHB production
in  100  mL  shake  ﬂasks  over  27  h  incubation,  higher  PHB  concentra-
tion  (4.01  g/L  vs.  3.41  g/L)  and  PHB  yield  coefﬁcient  based  on  sugar
consumed  (0.71  ±  0.28  vs.  0.34)  were  obtained.  In  a  fermentation
study  on  sweet  sorghum  juice  media  for  PHB  production  in  a  biore-
actor  with  2  L  working  volume,  Tanamool  et  al.  (2009)  obtained
much  lower  PHB  concentration  of  0.68  g/L  and  DCW  of  1.73  g/L  after
54  h. Another research conducted by Aremu et al. (2010) using cas-
sava  starch  for  PHB  production  in  4.2  L  working  volume  for  84  h
also  resulted  in  much  lower  PHB  concentration  (1.25  g/L)  and  DCW
(1.75  g/L).  Compared  to  studies  using  chemically  deﬁned  sucrose
based  synthetic media, PHB concentration and content obtained
from  fermentation  of  sugarbeet  juice  media  were  observed  to  be
comparable  (Grothe  et  al.,  1999;  El-Sayed  et  al.,  2009 ).

analogous  to  that  of  weak-gel  like  materials  (Bonino  et  al.,  2011 ).
Fig.  5b is consistent with this notion of a weak gel wherein the

tially  G/primeis  slightly  larger  than  G/prime/prime,  but  with  increasing  stress  there  is
structural  breakdown  and  G/primedecreases  rapidly  and  becomes  lower
than  that  of  G/prime/prime.  The  melting  point  and  crystallinity  from  two  DSC
scans  were  lower  than  those  from  Yezza  et  al.  (2007)  whose  work
focused  on  exploring  thermal  properties  of  PHB  produced  from

by  them  were  177.0◦C  and  175.0◦C,  respectively.  The  degradation
temperature  (273.86◦C)  of  PHB  obtained  from  TG  analysis  was  close
to  that  (292◦C)  obtained  by  El-Hadi  et  al.  (2002) .
5. Conclusions
The potential  of  sugarbeet  juice  based  media  for  production
of  PHB by A. latus was highlighted in this study. Dilute sugarbeet
juice, partially augmented with nutrients, is optimal for achieving
high PHB productivity and concentration. Although promising at
the  small  scale,  scaled-up  fermentation  studies  with  better  con-
trolled  conditions  (mainly  pH  and  dissolved  oxygen)  can  provide
further  insight  into  the  functional  feasibility  of  PHB  production
from  a  media  source  that  is  sustainable  and  economically  com-
petitive.  Though  sugarbeet  is  a  key  feedstock  for  sugar  production
in  the  United  States,  with  55%  of  all  sugar  being  produced  from  it
(USDA,  2009 ), this research highlights the potential of this feed-
stock  for  conversion  to  another  value  added  product,  PHB.  It  is
expected  that  results  of  this  study  can  subsequently  be  applied  to
enhance  the  conversion  of  waste  from  sugar  industry  (like  sugar-
beet  molasses  and  pulps)  for  PHB  as  well  as  copolymer  (such  as
PHBV  and  P(3HB-4HB))  production,  thus  increasing  market  poten-
tial  and  cost  effectiveness.
