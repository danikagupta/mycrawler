Laboratory Procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
L-(–)-Sorbose is supplied as a crystalline solid. A stock solution may be made by dissolving the  
L-(–)-sorbose in the solvent of choice, which should be purged with an inert gas. L-(–)-Sorbose is soluble in 
organic solvents such as ethanol, DMSO, and dimethyl formamide. The solubility of L-(–)-sorbose in these 
solvents is approximately  0.3, 30, and 20 mg/ml, respectively.
Further dilutions of the stock solution into aqueous buffers or isotonic saline should be made prior to 
performing biological experiments. Ensure that the residual amount of organic solvent is insignificant, 
since organic solvents may have physiological effects at low concentrations. Organic solvent-free aqueous 
solutions of L-(–)-sorbose can be prepared by directly dissolving the crystalline solid in aqueous buffers. The 
solubility of L-(–)-sorbose in PBS, pH 7.2, is approximately  10 mg/ml. We do not recommend storing the 
aqueous solution for more than one day.
Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
L-(–)-Sorbose is a monosaccharide and an intermediate in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid  
(Item	No.	14656)	in	bacteria.1,2 It is formed via dehydrogenation of D-sorbitol by D-sorbitol dehydrogenase 
(SLDH).2 L-(–)-Sorbose has commonly been used as a starting material in the commercial biosynthesis of 
L-ascorbic acid.
