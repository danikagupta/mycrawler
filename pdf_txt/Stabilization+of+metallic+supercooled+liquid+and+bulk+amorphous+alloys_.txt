Abstract —Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced by melting and solidiﬁcation processes
for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the meltingtemperature and solidiﬁes immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are
composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the ﬁndings of the
stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-,Fe-, Co-, Pd–Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized supercooled liquid state have threefeatures in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, signiﬁcant atomic size ratios above 12%,and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimentaldata of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the pro-
duction of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1–100 mm by using various casting processes.
Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good cor-rosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to theappearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian ﬂow. The new Fe- and Co-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force andhigh permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale particles into Zr-based bulk amor-
phous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility.
The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clariﬁcation of the stabilization criteria ofthe supercooled liquid, will promise the future deﬁnite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basicscience and engineering materials. #2000 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

1. HISTORY AND ALLOY COMPONENTS OF BULK
AMORPHOUS ALLOYS
Since the ﬁrst synthesis of an amorphous phase in
the Au–Si system by a rapid solidiﬁcation technique
in 1960 [1], a great number of amorphous alloys
has been produced for the last three decades. It iswell known that Fe-, Co- and Ni-based amorphous
alloys found before 1990 require high cooling rates
above 10
5K/s for glass formation and the resulting
sample thickness is limited to less than about 50 mm
[2]. As exceptional examples, one can observe that
Pd–Ni–P and Pt–Ni–P amorphous alloys havelower critical cooling rates of the order of 10
3K/s
[3] and a large amorphous alloy sphere with a di-
ameter of about 10 mm is produced by repeatedmelting of the Pd–Ni–P alloy covered with a B 2O3
ﬂux medium in a quartz crucible [4,5]. More
recently, since 1988, we have succeeded in ﬁndingnew multicomponent alloy systems with muchlower critical cooling rates in the Mg- [6], Ln- [7],
Zr- [8,9], Fe- [10,11], Pd–Cu- [12], Pd–Fe- [13], Ti-
[14,15] and Ni-based [16] alloy systems. Figure 1shows the relationship between the critical coolingrate ( R
c), maximum sample thickness ( tmax) and
reduced glass transition temperature ( Tg/Tm) for
amorphous alloys reported to date [17–21]. Thelowest R
cis as low as 0.10 K/s [22] for the
Pd40Cu30Ni10P20alloy and the tmaxreaches values
as large as about 100 mm. It is also noticed that the
recent improvement of the glass-forming ability
(GFA) reaches 6–7 orders for the critical coolingrate and 3–4 orders for the maximum thickness.There is a clear tendency for GFA to increase with
increasing T
g/Tm. Figure 2 shows the relationship
between Rc,tmaxand the temperature interval of aActa mater. 48 (2000) 279–306

glass transition temperature ( Tg) and crystallization
temperature ( Tx), (TxÿTg) [17–21]. One can see a
clear tendency for GFA to increase with increasingT
x. The value of Txexceeds 100 K for several amor-
phous alloys in Zr–Al–Ni–Cu and Pd–Cu–Ni–P
systems and the largest DTxreaches 127 K for the
Zr–Al–Ni–Cu base system.
Table 1 summarizes typical bulk amorphous alloy
systems reported to date and the calendar years
when details of each alloy system were published.Bulk amorphous alloys can be divided into nonfer-
rous and ferrous alloy systems. The nonferrous
alloy systems are Mg–Ln–M (Ln=lanthanidemetal, M=Ni, Cu or Zn) [23], Ln–Al–TM (TM=
VI–VIII group transition metal) [7], Zr–Al–TM [8],
Zr–Ti–Al–TM [24,25], Ti–Zr–TM [26], Zr–Ti–TM–Be [9], Zr–(Nb,Pd)–Al–TM [25], Pd–Cu–Ni–P [12],
Pd–Fe–Ni–P [13], Ti–Zr–Ni–Cu–Sn [14] and
Ti–Zr–Ni–Cu–(Si,B) [15] systems. Ferrous alloysystems comprise Fe–(Al,Ga)–metalloids [10],(Fe,Co,Ni)–(Zr,Hf,Nb)–B [11], Fe–Co–Ln–B [27],
Ni–Ti–P [16] and Ni–Nb–(Cr,Mo)–(P,B) [28]
alloys. It is observed that the ferrous alloy systemshave been found during the last four years after the
synthesis of the nonferrous alloy systems. We also
examined the features of the alloy components ofthese nonferrous and ferrous bulk amorphous
alloys. The alloy components are divided into ﬁve
groups, as summarized in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst group (i)consists of ETM (or Ln), Al and LTM as exempli-
ﬁed for Zr–Al–Ni and Ln–Al–Ni systems. The sec-
ond group (ii) is composed of LTM, ETM andmetalloid as indicated by Fe–Zr–B and Co–Nb–Bsystems. The third group (iii) is LTM (Fe)–
(Al,Ga)–metalloid systems and the fourth group
(iv) is indicated by Mg–Ln–LTM and ETM(Zr,Ti)–Be–LTM systems. However, the Pd–Cu–Ni–P
and Pd–Ni–P systems (v) are composed only of two
kinds of group element (LTM and metalloid),
which are di/C128erent from the combination of thethree types of group elements for the alloys belong-ing to the four previous groups (i)–(iv).
Consequently, we must consider two di/C128erent mech-
anisms for the achievement of the high stability ofthe supercooled liquid for the alloys of the ﬁrst four
groups and of the ﬁfth group of alloys.

AND REASONS FOR HIGH GLASS-FORMING
ABILITY
Firstly, the reason for the stabilization of the
supercooled liquid for the alloys belonging to the
groups (i)–(iv) is discussed. All the alloy systems in
these groups are based on the following threeempirical rules [17–21]: (1) multicomponent systemsconsisting of more than three elements; (2) signiﬁ-
cant di/C128erence in atomic size ratios above about
12% among the three main constituent elements;and (3) negative heats of mixing among the three
main constituent elements. We want to know the
reason why the alloys with the three empirical rulescan have a high GFA. Based on the previouslyreported experimental data obtained for multicom-
ponent amorphous alloys, it has been clariﬁed [17–
21] that amorphous alloys can have (a) higherdegrees of dense randomly packed atomic conﬁgur-
ations, (b) new local atomic conﬁgurations, whichare di/C128erent from those of the corresponding crys-talline phases, and (c) a homogeneous atomic con-
ﬁguration of the multicomponents on a long-range
scale. Subsequently, some experimental data arepresented. Table 2 summarizes the densities of some
bulk amorphous alloys in as-cast and fully crystal-
lized states. The di/C128erence in the densities betweenthe as-cast amorphous and fully crystallized statesis in the range of 0.30–0.54% [29], which is much
smaller than the previously reported value range of
about 2% [30] for ordinary amorphous alloys withmuch higher R
cabove 105K/s. Such small di/C128er-
ences in values indicate that the bulk amorphous
alloys have higher dense randomly packed atomic
conﬁgurations. Although the di/C128erence in densitiesbetween the amorphous and crystalline phases is

respectively.INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS 281small, a systematic increase in the density by struc-
tural relaxation, followed by a signiﬁcant increaseupon crystallization, has been conﬁrmed for thePd
40Cu30Ni10P20alloy [21]. We further examined
the coordination numbers and atomic distances of
each atomic pair for the multicomponent bulk
amorphous alloys by the anomalous X-ray scatter-ing technique and always noticed the existence of atleast one atomic pair with signiﬁcant di/C128erence incoordination numbers before and after crystalliza-tion. For instance, Table 3 summarizes the coordi-nation numbers and atomic distances calculatedfrom (a) the ordinary radial distribution function
(RDF), and from the environmental RDFs for (b)
Zr and (c) Ni in the Zr
60Al15Ni25amorphous alloy
[31]. As compared with the changes in the coordi-nation numbers and atomic distances of Zr–Ni andZr–Zr atomic pairs, the coordination number of theZr–Al atomic pair increases drastically after crystal-lization. The signiﬁcant change implies the necessityof long-range atomic rearrangements of Al atoms
around Zr for the progress of crystallization as wellas the di/C128erence in the local atomic conﬁgurationsbetween the amorphous and crystalline phases.Furthermore, neither splitting of the second peak
nor pre-peak at the lower wave vector is seen in the
total structure factors of the multicomponent amor-phous alloys. This feature of the structure factors isnearly the same as that found for ordinary alloyliquids, indicating the homogeneous distribution ofconstituent elements on a long-range scale. As sum-marized in Table 4, in a new type of supercooledliquid with a higher degree of dense randomly
packed atomic conﬁgurations, new local atomic
conﬁgurations and long-range homogeneous atomicconﬁgurations, we have high solid/liquid interfacialenergy which is favorable for the suppression ofnucleation of a crystalline phase. The new type ofliquid can have the diculty of atomic rearrange-ment, leading to a decrease of atomic di/C128usivityTable 3.

satisfy the three empirical rules
282 INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYSand an increase of viscosity. Therefore, the new
liquid can have high Tg. The supercooled liquid
also has the necessity for atomic rearrangements on
a long-range scale for crystallization, which causes
the suppression of growth of a crystalline phase. In
any event, the multicomponent alloys with the threeempirical rules always have very deep eutectic val-
leys with low melting temperatures, leading to the
appearance of high T
g/Tmand large DTx.
Therefore, a high thermal stability of supercooled
liquid for the multicomponent amorphous alloyswhich satisﬁes the three empirical rules is observed.
As shown in Fig. 3, the Pd–Cu–Ni–P and Pd–
Ni–P amorphous alloys do not satisfy the three
empirical rules because the heats of mixing are
nearly zero for Pd–Cu and Pd–Ni pairs [32] and the
atomic size ratios between Pd and Cu or Ni is less
than 10% [33]. In order to investigate the origin ofthe achievement of high stability of supercooled
liquid against crystallization, we examined the
structure of the Pd
40Cu30Ni10P20amorphous alloy
by the anomalous X-ray scattering method. Figure
4 shows the ordinary radial distribution function
and environmental radial distribution functions
around Ni and Cu atoms for the Pd–Cu–Ni–Pamorphous alloy [34], together with the data for the
Pd
40Ni40P20amorphous alloy. The environmental
RDF around Ni for the Pd–Cu–Ni–P alloy is
nearly the same as that for the Pd–Ni–P alloy,
while the partial RDF around the Cu atom is di/C128er-ent from that around the Ni atom, indicating thatthe local atomic conﬁguration around Cu is di/C128er-
ent from that around Ni. The atomic distances and
coordination numbers of each atomic pair obtainedfrom the structural data for the Pd–Cu–Ni–P alloy
can be interpreted by the assumption that the Pd–
Cu–Ni–P amorphous alloy is composed of two
large clustered units of a trigonal prism capped
with three half-octahedra for the Pd–Ni–P regionand a tetragonal dodecahedron for the Pd–Cu–P
region, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The coexistence of
the two large clustered units seems to play an im-
portant role in the stabilization of the supercooled
liquid for the Pd-based alloy, because of the strongbonding nature of metal–metalloid atomic pairs in
the clustered units, high stability of metal–metalloid
clustered units and diculty of rearrangementamong the clustered units. Furthermore, the GFA
of the Pd–Cu–Ni–P alloy is much higher than that
for the Pd–Ni–P alloy and the di/C128erence is due to
the coexistence of the two large clustered units of
the trigonal prism and tetragonal dodecahedronrather than the existence of only the trigonal prism.

By choosing the above-described multicomponent
alloy systems, we can produce bulk amorphousalloys by using two kinds of production techniquesof solidiﬁcation and consolidation [17–21]. As a
solidiﬁcation technique, one can list water-quench-
ing, copper-mold casting, high-pressure die casting,arc melting, unidirectional melting, suction castingand squeeze casting. Bulk amorphous alloys arealso produced by hot pressing and warm extrusion
of atomized amorphous powders in the supercooled
liquid region. Table 5 summarizes t
maxby use of
the solidiﬁcation techniques and approximates Rcin
typical alloy systems. The value of tmaxis about
10 mm for the Ln- [35] and Mg-based [36] alloys,
30 mm [37] for the Zr-based alloys, 5–6 mm for theFe- [38] and Ti-based [14] alloys, 75–80 mm [39] forthe Pd–Cu–Ni–P alloy and 3 mm [28] for the Ni-based alloy. There is a clear tendency for t
maxto
increase with decreasing Rc. As examples, Fig. 6
shows the shape and outer surface appearance oftypical bulk amorphous alloys 17 mm in diameterand 600 or 120 mm in length for theZr
60Al10Ni10Cu20amorphous alloy and 75 mm in
diameter and 80 mm in height for the
Pd40Cu30Ni10P20amorphous alloy. These bulk
amorphous alloys have smooth outer surfaces andgood metallic luster. By using these bulk amor-
phous alloys, R
cis determined accurately through
the construction of continuous cooling transform-ation (CCT) curve. Figure 7 shows the CCT curvesof the Pd
40Cu30Ni10P20alloy in the non-ﬂuxed and
B2O3ﬂuxed states [22]. The Rcvalue is 1.58 K/s in
the non-ﬂuxed state and decreases to 0.100 K/s in
the ﬂuxed state. The B 2O3ﬂux treatment is useful
to decrease the Rcvalue because of the decrease in
heterogeneous nucleation of crystalline phasesthrough the puriﬁcation of the molten alloy [29,30].
In order to conﬁrm further the importance of the
suppression of heterogeneous nucleation, we evalu-ated the temperature–time-transformation (TTT)curve under the assumption of the absence of het-
erogeneous nucleation. The calculated R
cvalue
decreases further by two orders to 0.001 K/s. Thisresult indicates that the heterogeneous nucleationcannot be completely eliminated even by the B
2O3
ﬂux treatment.
4. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
In addition to the importance of basic science, it
is important in applications as engineering materials
to clarify the mechanical properties of bulk amor-
phous alloys. Figure 8 shows the relationshipbetween the tensile fracture strength ( s
f) and
Young’s modulus ( E) for the cast bulk amorphous
Zr–Ti–Al–Ni–Cu alloys in sheet and cylinder formswith thicknesses (or diameters) of 1–5 mm [21]. There
is a clear tendency for sfto increase with increasing E.
Figure 9 shows the relationship between sforHv
and Efor bulk amorphous Mg–Cu–Y, La–Al–Ni,
La–Al–Co–Ni–Cu, Zr–Ti–Al–Ni–Cu, Pd–Cu–Ni–P
and Ti–Zr–Ni–Cu–Sn alloys together with the
data of conventional crystalline alloys. The bulkamorphous alloys have high s
fof 840–2100 MPa
combined with Eof 47–102 GPa which depend on
alloy compositions. The bulk amorphous alloysexhibit higher s
f, higher Hvand lower Ethan those
of any kinds of crystalline alloys. The feature of the
mechanical properties for the bulk amorphous
alloys is signiﬁcantly di/C128erent from that forthe crystalline alloys. We further examined the
compositional dependence of Charpy impact frac-
ture energy for the cast bulk amorphousZr
70ÿxÿyTixAlyCu20Ni10sheets with a thickness of
2.5 mm [40]. The impact fracture energy is in the
range of 122–135 kJ/m2for the Zr-based alloys con-
taining 0–5 at.% Ti and 10 at.% Al and tends to
decrease with the deviation from the alloy compo-
sition range. We also measured the three-pointbending ﬂexural stress and deﬂection curves of theZr–Al–Ni–Cu and Zr–Ti–Al–Ni–Cu bulk amor-
phous alloys [40]. These bulk amorphous alloys
have high bending ﬂexural strength values of 3000–3900 MPa which are 2.0–2.5 times higher than
those for crystalline Zr- and Ti-based alloys.
Furthermore, all these bulk amorphous alloys havelarge deﬂection values above 0.4 mm. Figure 10
summarizes the bending and rotating beam fatigue
strength as a function of number up to failure forthe bulk amorphous Zr
65Al10Ni10Cu15[21] and
Pd40Cu30Ni10P20[41] alloys, respectively, together
with the data under tensile stress conditions for
melt-spun Pd 80Si20[42], Ni 75Si8B17[43] and
Co75Si10B15[43] amorphous ribbons. When the fati-
gue limit is deﬁned by the ratio of the minimum
fatigue strength after 107cycles to the static bend-
ing or tensile fracture strength, the fatigue limit of
the bulk amorphous alloys is in the range of 0.20–
0.30, in agreement with the previous results [42,43]for the melt-spun amorphous ribbons. The bending
fatigue strength is as high as about 1000 MPa at
cycles of 310
4. It is thus conﬁrmed that the pre-
sent Zr- and Pd–Cu-based bulk amorphous alloyshave good combination of various mechanical prop-Table 5. Maximum thickness ( tmax) and critical cooling rate ( Rc)

crystalline alloys.
In addition to the high Charpy impact fracture
energy, high fatigue strength, large bending deﬂec-tion and large elastic elongation, it is important toclarify the fracture toughness and fracture mech-anics of bulk amorphous alloys for the extension ofapplication ﬁelds of bulk amorphous alloys as high-
strength materials. There is a high possibility that
bulk amorphous alloys contain some ﬂaws. Wewant to know the maximum stress that the bulkamorphous alloy can withstand if it contains ﬂawsof a certain size and geometry. Fracture toughnessrepresents the ability of the amorphous alloy con-taining a ﬂaw to withstand an applied load. Ascompared with the results of an impact test,fracture toughness is a quantitative property of thealloy. The shape and dimension of the test speci-mens used for the measurement of fracture tough-ness of a Zr
55Al10Ni5Cu30bulk amorphous alloy
agree with ASTM criteria. Assuming that the stress
ﬁeld near the crack tip is controlled by linear frac-ture mechanics and the small-scale yielding con-
dition, the fracture toughness ( K-value) can be
evaluated according to ASTM criteria. Themeasured K
cvalues of Zr-based amorphous alloys
with a thickness of 3 mm are about 67 MPa Zm
for Zr 55Al10Ni5Cu30 and 70 MPa Zm for
Zr55Al10Ni5Cu29Nb1[21]. In the fracture surface
region near the crack tip shown in Fig. 11, a vein
fracture pattern is observed and no appreciable
embrittled pattern is seen, indicating that these bulkamorphous alloys have high plastic deformability

were obtained for the sheet specimen with a thick-
ness of 3.0 mm. It is not certain whether or not the
Kvalues correspond to the plain strain fracture
toughness ( KIc). However, it is noticed that the K
values are much higher than those (24–36 MPa Zm)
[44] for age-hardened Al-based alloys and compar-able to those (54–98 MPa Zm) [44] for commercial
Ti-based alloys. The Kvalues are also higher than
that (55 MPa Zm) [45] for the Zr–Ti–Be–Ni–Cu
bulk amorphous alloy. Here, it is particularly im-portant to point out that the Kvalues decrease to
about 1 MPa Zm for the Zr–Ti–Be–Ni–Cu amor-
phous alloy containing nanocrystalline particles[46], while the Zr–Al–Ni–Cu base bulk amorphous
alloys containing nanocrystalline particles exhibit
a remarkably improved Kvalue of about
160 MPa Zm [47], which exceeds largely those of
conventional Ti- and alloy steels. For the measure-
ment of a real Kvalue for the bulk amorphous
alloy containing nanocrystalline particles with high
fracture toughness, it is necessary to use bulk amor-
phous alloys with much larger thicknesses.
5. CORROSION RESISTANCE
When bulk amorphous alloys for their good sta-
tic and dynamic mechanical properties are used as
structural materials, it is essential for the bulk
amorphous alloys to have good corrosion resistancein various kinds of corrosive solutions. There have
been no data published on the corrosion resistance
of Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys in any kinds ofcorrosive solution. We examined the corrosion re-
sistance of melt-spun amorphous alloys in Zr–TM–
Al–Ni–Cu (TM=Ti,Cr,Nb,Ta) systems in HCl andNaCl solutions and noticed that the Nb- and Ta-containing amorphous alloys exhibit good corrosionresistance in their solutions at room temperature
[21, 48]. We have conﬁrmed that the X-ray di/C128rac-
tion patterns of melt-spun Zr
60ÿxMxAl10Ni10Cu20
(M=Ti,Nb,Ta; x= 5–20 at.%) alloys consist
only of a main broad peak at a wave vector Kpof
26–27 nmÿ1and no appreciable di/C128raction peak
due to the precipitation of a crystalline phase
is seen over the composition range up to 20 at.%
of Ti, Nb or Ta. However, the formation of
Zr60ÿxCrxAl10Ni10Cu20amorphous alloys was lim-
ited to less than 10 at.%Cr. Figure 12 shows the
corrosion rates of the Zr 60ÿxTM xAl10Ni10Cu20
(TM=Ti,Cr,Nb,Ta) amorphous alloys subjected to
immersion for 16 and 64 h in 6M HCl solution at
295 K. The corrosion rates of the Zr–Al–Ni–Cu
and Zr–Cr–Al–Ni–Cu amorphous alloys are toohigh to measure after immersion for 64 h, even
though the corrosion rates of their amorphous
alloys in 1 M HCl show very low values below
0.01 mm/year. Even in severe corrosive solution, the
Nb- and Ta-containing alloys exhibit rather low
corrosion rates below 0.1 mm/year after immersion
for 64 h. Figure 12 also shows that the e/C128ect of the
additional elements on the corrosion resistance is
largest for Nb, followed by Ta, Ti and then Cr.
It is also important to clarify the corrosion resist-
ance of the Zr-based amorphous alloys in NaCl sol-
ution. Figure 13 shows the current density as a
function of potential in 3 mol% NaCl solution at
298 K for Zr
60Al10Ni10Cu20,Z r 55Ti2.5Al12.5Ni10Cu20
and Zr 55Nb5Al10Ni10Cu20 amorphous alloys,
together with the data of pure crystalline Zr metal.
The solution was exposed in air. The corrosionresistance is largest for the Nb-containing alloy,
followed by the Ti-containing alloy and then the
Zr–Al–Ni–Cu alloy. The corrosion resistance of the
Nb-containing alloy is also superior to that for pure
Zr metal, indicating the remarkable e/C128ectiveness of

sistance even in the NaCl solution. Considering the
previous data [25] that a bulk amorphous
Zr55Nb5Al10Ni10Cu20ingot with a thickness of
8 mm was produced by the simple process of arc
melting, followed by cooling on a copper hearth
cooled with water, the addition of about 5 at.% Nbis concluded to be useful for the formation of bulkamorphous Zr-based alloys exhibiting good cor-
rosion resistance.
6. HIGH STRAIN-RATE SUPERPLASTICITY
As described above, the bulk amorphous alloys
have a wide supercooled liquid region of more than
60 K before crystallization. Figure 14 shows thechange in viscosity with reduced temperature T
r
T=Tmfor the Pd 40Cu30Ni10P20amorphous alloy[49]. The data of SiO 2glass are also shown for com-
parison. The viscosity of the Pd-based amorphous
alloy has much larger temperature dependence as
compared with SiO 2glass, indicating that the Pd-
based amorphous alloy belongs to the fragile type
glass which is di/C128erent from the strong type of SiO 2
glass. The steep temperature dependence of vis-
cosity causes the low values of 105–108Pas in the
supercooled liquid region. Here, it is important to
describe that the low viscosities correspond to veryshort relaxation times of 10
ÿ5–10ÿ2s [3]. By utiliz-
ing the short relaxation times, it is expected to have
a high strain-rate ﬂowability for the bulk amor-
phous alloys. Therefore, we examined the defor-
mation behavior in the supercooled liquid regionfor the bulk amorphous alloys. Figure 15 shows the
relation between ﬂow stress and strain rate for the
Fig. 10. Maximum bending and rotating beam fatigue stress as a function of cyclic number up to fail-
ure for bulk amorphous Zr 65Al10Ni10Cu15and Pd 40Cu30Ni10P20alloys. The data under tensile stress

phous alloys. The Tgis 653 K for the Zr-based
alloy and 473 K for the La-based alloy. The ﬂow
stress in the supercooled liquid region is pro-
portional to strain rate in the strain-rate range of
10ÿ3–10ÿ1sÿ1for both alloys, suggesting that the
deformation obeys the Newtonian ﬂow behavior in
an appropriate strain-rate condition. In order toconﬁrm the achievement of the Newtonian ﬂow, the
data in Fig. 15 were analyzed by using the relation
Zs=3_e[52], where Zis viscosity, sis ﬂow stress
and _eis strain rate. The resulting viscosities of the
Zr–Al–Ni–Cu and La–Al–Ni amorphous alloys are
plotted as a function of strain rate in Fig. 16. Theviscosity in the supercooled liquid region is indepen-
dent of strain rate in a wide strain-rate range up to
about 0.1 s
ÿ1, indicating the achievement of
Newtonian ﬂow in the wide strain-rate range. With
further increasing strain rate, the viscosity is depen-
dent on strain rate and decreases almost linearly, in-dicating that the deformation behavior of the

non-Newtonian ﬂow. Furthermore, the deformationmode of the amorphous solid occurs through thenon-Newtonian ﬂow and hence it is concluded thatthe Newtonian ﬂow can occur only in the super-cooled liquid region. There is no appreciable di/C128er-
ence in the features of non-Newtonian ﬂow mode in
the supercooled liquid and amorphous solid. Theindependence of viscosity with strain rate is import-ant for practical use of viscous ﬂow working in thesupercooled liquid region of bulk amorphous alloys.With the aim of clarifying in more detail the
Newtonian ﬂow behavior in the supercooled liquid,
we examined the relation between true stress ( s)
and _ein the supercooled liquid for the
Zr
55Al10Ni5Cu30amorphous alloy. A good linear
relation is recognized in the relation between sand_eshown in Fig. 17 and the linear relation is
expressed by sK_em[53]. The slope of the linear
relation corresponds to the strain-rate sensitivity
exponent ( mvalue) and the mvalue is as large as
1.0, indicating the achievement of ideal Newtonian
ﬂow, namely, an ideal superplasticity. A similar
Newtonian ﬂow has also been observed for the
Pd40Cu30Ni10P20amorphous alloy [54], as recog-
nized that the viscosity is independent of _ewhileZ
increases linearly with s.
We also tried to determine a deformation con-
dition in which a maximum elongation by viscous
ﬂow is obtained. Figure 18 shows the relation
between elongation at di/C128erent testing temperaturesand strain rates for the Zr
65Al10Ni10Cu15and
La55Al20Ni25amorphous alloys, together with data
for ductility of the deformed samples [50,51]. The
maximum elongation is obtained in the supercooled
liquid and at a constant deformation conditionwhere the strain rate lies in the Newtonian ﬂow
region just below the transition from Newtonian to
non-Newtonian ﬂow. The maximum elongation is
about 350% for the Zr-based alloy and about
1800% for the La-based alloy with both alloysmaintaining good bending ductility when exhibiting
maximum elongation. The decrease in elongation in
the lower strain-rate region is due to the progress of
the incipient-stage reaction for crystallization and
that in the higher strain-rate region results from a
rapid increase in ﬂow volume generated during ﬂow
deformation. It is well known that total elongationis strongly dependent on the original cross-section
of the specimens. The La-based amorphous alloys
exhibit a large elongation of 1800% even in the
melt-spun ribbon form with a thickness of about
20mm. The elongation is expected to increase sig-
niﬁcantly when using bulk amorphous alloy with a
much larger cross-section. It has been reported that
elongation reaches about 15 000% [55] for cylindri-
cal specimens with a diameter of 1.5 mm and about
10
6% [56] for cylindrical specimens with a diameter

phous alloys deformed at various temperatures.INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS 289of 5 mm. Here, it is also important to point out
that specimens subjected to heavy tensile defor-mation also keep good bending ductility. The defor-
mation temperatures and deformation times leading
to extremely large elongations were examined incomparison with the isothermal temperature–time-transformation curve of the La
55Al20Ni25amor-
phous alloy. The deformation temperatures and
times are located in the higher temperature andlonger time region as compared with the onset tem-perature and time line for crystallization. The
distinct discrepancy indicates clearly that the
Newtonian-ﬂow deformation in the appropriate de-formation condition causes a degradation of crystal-lization reaction, namely, the deformation-inducedstabilization of supercooled liquid. Although the
mechanism for the deformation-induced stabiliz-
ation is not clear, it may be due to the suppression
of the incipient reaction for crystallization as wellas of the accumulation of ﬂow volumes introducedby the non-Newtonian ﬂow deformation. The ﬁnd-
ing that the supercooled liquid is stabilized by
choosing the Newtonian ﬂow at the appropriatestrain rate just below the transition region from
Newtonian to non-Newtonian ﬂow is important for
further extension of the viscous-ﬂow working ofbulk amorphous alloys.
7. MAGNETIC PROPERTIES
Based on the three empirical rules for achieve-
ment of high GFA, a new bulk amorphous alloy
with ferromagnetism at room temperature has been
developed. As described in Section 1, soft ferromag-netic bulk amorphous alloys have been synthesized
in multicomponent Fe–(Al,Ga)–(P,C,B,Si) [10], Co–
Cr–(Al,Ga)–(P,B,C) [57], Fe–(Co,Ni)–(Zr,Nb,Ta)–B [11] and Co–Fe–(Zr,Nb,Ta)–B [58] systems. This
section describes the relationship of soft magnetic
properties of new Fe- and Co-based amorphousalloys with high thermal stability of supercooledliquid before crystallization and high GFA in melt-
spun ribbon and cast bulk cylinder forms.

Fe74Al4Ga2P12B4Si4amorphous alloys in an opti-
mally annealed state [59]. It is seen that these amor-
phous alloys exhibit typical soft magnetic-type
hysteresis curves. Table 6 summarizes the magneticproperties of saturation magnetization ( I
s), residual
magnetization ( Ir), squareness ratio ( Ir/Is), coercive
force ( Hc), e/C128ective permeability ( me) at 1 kHz and
saturated magnetostriction ( ls) of the three kinds of
amorphous alloy ribbons, together with the data ofT
g,TmandTx. The Is,Hcandmevalues, which are
important for a soft magnetic material, are about
1.1 T, 5–10 A/m and 12 000 to 19 000, respectively,indicating that the present Fe-based amorphous rib-
bons possess good soft magnetic properties. In par-
ticular, H

conventional Fe–Si–B amorphous ribbons, thoughI
sdecreases slightly owing to the lower Fe concen-
trations. In comparison with those for the Fe–Si–B
alloys, the lower H cand higher mevalues are pre-
sumably due to the lower lsvalue.
In addition to Fe–(Al,Ga)–(P,B,Si) systems, Fe–
(Al,Ga)–(P,C,B) [10] and Fe–(Al,Ga)–(P,C,B,Si)
[62] amorphous alloys exhibit good soft magneticproperties. Although T
cof the Fe–Al–Ga–P–C–B–
Si amorphous alloys decreases monotonously with
the replacement of Fe by Si, the other replacement
mode, i.e. the replacement of P, Al or C by Si,causes an increase of T
cand the highest Tcfor the
Fe-based amorphous alloys with DTxabove 50 K
is 602 K for the Fe 72Al4Ga2P11C6B4Si1alloy.

Si dependence of Isand Hcvalues. The Isvalues
increase from 1.04 to 1.13 T with increasing Si con-tent for the latter three alloys where the metalloids
are replaced by Si, whereas the replacement of Fe
by Si decreases linearly I
svalues from 1.04 to
0.665 T. On the other hand, Hcvalues tend to
increase in the range 1.93–18.2 A/m with increasing
Si content for the four alloy series. From the com-
positional dependence of Tx,Tc,Isand Hc,i ti s
concluded that the Fe 72Al5Ga2P10C6B4Si1and
Fe72Al5Ga2P11C5B4Si1amorphous alloys have a
good combination of higher thermal stability ofsupercooled liquid and better soft magnetic proper-
ties with higher T
c.
7.1.2. Fe–TM–B systems. The Isvalues of melt-
spun Fe 63ÿxCoxNi7Zr10B20(x= 3 ,7 ,1 4a n d
17 at.%) amorphous alloys [11] are in the range of0.91–0.96 T and independent of Co content. On the
other hand, the Hcvalues increase from 2.7 to
10 A/m with increasing Co content from 3 to
17 at.%. The squareness ratio deﬁned by the ratio
ofIrtoIsis in the range of 0.32–0.45. From the
thermomagnetic data, Tcwas measured to be 567 K
for the Fe 56Co7Ni7Zr10B20alloy. These soft mag-
netic properties were improved by annealing for600 s at 750 K, which is lower by about 60 K than
T
g. That is, Is,HcandIr/Isof the annealed amor-
phous alloy are 0.96 T, 2.41 A/m and 0.60, respect-ively. Furthermore, m
eat 1 kHz was measured to be
5100 for the as-spun sample and 17 700 for the
annealed sample. These magnetic data indicate thatthe Fe-based amorphous alloy has good soft mag-
netic properties comparable to those [60,61] for the
other Fe-based amorphous alloys, though the I
s
value is slightly lower because of the lower Fe con-
centration.
We measured hysteresis I–H curves of
Fe56Co7Ni7Zr10ÿxNbxB20 amorphous alloys
annealed for 300 s at 800 K just below Tg[63]. It
has been reported that the replacement of Zr by Nb
decreases Isfrom 0.96 T at 0 at.% Nb to 0.61 T at
10 at.% Nb through 0.75 T at 2 at.% Nb, while Hc
shows low values of 1.1–2.0 A/m and does not have
appreciable compositional dependence. Although
the total content of Fe and Co elements remainsconstant, I
sdecreases by 0.21 T only by the
addition of 2 at.% Nb. The change in Iswith Nb
content seems to reﬂect the change of Tc. The hys-
teresis I–Hcurves for the Fe 56Co7Ni7Zr10ÿxTaxB20
amorphous alloys showed a similar change with Ta
content [64]. The Isvalues decrease gradually from
0.96 to 0.71 T in the range of up to 6 at.% Ta and
increases to 0.85 T at 8 at.% Ta, while Hcmaintains
low values of 2.0–2.7 A/m in the whole Ta contentrange. Figure 21 shows the changes in m

Fe56Co7Ni7Zr10ÿxMxB20(M=Nb or Ta) amor-
phous alloys in as-spun and annealed (300 s, 800 K)

It is seen that Hcandmeare signiﬁcantly improved
by the annealing treatment, though no distinct
changes in Isandlsare recognized. The maximum
mefor the annealed samples reaches 25 000 at
2 at.% Nb and 16 700 at 8 at.% Ta. The compo-
sitions showing maximum mevalues agree withTable 6. Thermal stability and magnetic properties of the amorphous (a) Fe 80P12B4Si4, (b) Fe 76Al4P12B4Si4and (c) Fe 74Al4Ga2P12B4Si4

range of 7–1210ÿ6for the Nb-containing alloys
and 12–1510ÿ6for the Ta-containing alloys, the
value being slightly lower for the former group ofalloys. It has been conﬁrmed that T
calso decreases
monotonously from 594 to 447 K with increasing
Nb content of 0–10 at.% Nb. However, the changeinT
cas a function of Ta is slightly di/C128erent from
that for the Nb-containing alloy. That is, Tc

then increases gradually in the Ta content range up
to 6 at.% and signiﬁcantly to 538 K at 8 at.% Ta.
The compositional dependence of Tcis analogous
to that for Isand hence an alloy design leading to
an increase of Tcis concluded to be an e/C128ective
method for an increase in Is. From the compo-
sitional dependence of the thermal stability of thesupercooled liquid and the magnetic properties, it is
concluded that the 2 at.% Nb- or 8 at.% Ta-con-
taining alloy has the combination of high GFA andgood soft magnetic properties.

increase linearly in the range 0.45–0.83 T withincreasing Fe content and with decreasing Zr con-tent, while H
cshows low values of 7 A/m in the
range below 10 at.% Fe and increases signiﬁcantly
with a further increase in Fe content. The lsvalue
is negative,ÿ1.510ÿ6at 0 at.% Fe, changing to
positive values on passing through zero at around
2 at.% Fe. The further increase of Fe contentcauses a linear increase in the positive l
s, butlsis
less than 1010ÿ6even at 20 at.% Fe. It is there-
fore concluded that the Co-based amorphous alloys
containing more than 14 at.% Fe exhibit simul-
taneously small lsvalues as well as glass transition
and a supercooled liquid region before crystalliza-
tion. Even with the present limited data, it ischaracterized that Co
72ÿxFexZr8B20(x=1 6 –

quency to 10 MHz. The mevalues are much higher

Fe78Si9B13(METGLAS 2605S-2) and 1.42 mOm for
the Co–Fe–Ni–B–Si METGLAS 2714A alloy [61].
Consequently, the excellent high-frequency per-
meability characteristics of the present amorphousalloys are probably due to the decrease of eddy cur-rent loss resulting from the higher electrical resistiv-
ities. It is therefore concluded that the present Co-
based amorphous alloys have good soft magneticproperties and high stability of supercooled liquid
against crystallization.
7.2. Cast bulk amorphous alloys
7.2.1. Fe–(Al,Ga)–(P,C,B,Si) system. The Fe-
based amorphous alloys with the large supercooledliquid region of over 60 K before crystallization are
expected to have a high GFA which enables us to
produce bulk amorphous alloys with diametersabove 1 mm by the copper-mold casting process.
The cast Fe
72Al5Ga2P11C6B4 [66] and
Fe72Al5Ga2P10C6B4Si1[62,67] amorphous cylinders
with diameters of 1–3 mm have been conﬁrmed to
have smooth outer surfaces and metallic luster.
Besides, the agreement of the outer shape of thecast samples with the inner cavity of the copper
mold indicates a good castability of these Fe-based
alloys. Even after an appropriate etching treatment,no appreciable contrast corresponding to a crystal-line phase is seen over the whole transversecross-sectional structure of the cast
Fe
72Al5Ga2P10C6B4Si1cylinders with diameters of 1
and 2 mm. In addition, neither cavities nor shrink-age holes are observed, indicating that the amor-phous alloy has a good castability owing to the lack
of discontinuous change in the speciﬁc volume–tem-
perature reaction, which is ordinarily recognized forcrystalline alloys obtained from the liquid. The castFe
72Al5Ga2P11C6B4amorphous cylinders, with di-
ameters of 0.5–1.5 mm [66], show the sequential
changes of the glass transition, supercooled liquidand then single-stage exothermic peak which agreewith those of the corresponding melt-spun amor-
phous ribbon. No distinct changes in the thermal
stability and crystallization mode of the supercooledliquid are seen between the cast amorphous cylin-ders and the melt-spun amorphous ribbon.
The hysteresis I–H curve of the cast
Fe
72Al5Ga2P11C6B4amorphous cylinder with a di-
ameter of 1 mm was examined in the as-cast andannealed (723 K, 600 s) states [66]. The I
s,Hcand
Ir/Isvalues of the annealed sample are 1.07 T,
5.1 A/m and 0.37, respectively, indicating that the
cast amorphous cylinder has good soft magneticproperties. Besides, the m
eat 1 kHz for the annealed
amorphous cylinder also shows a high value of
7000. The soft magnetic properties were found to
be further improved for the 1 at.% Si-containingalloy [62,67]. Figure 24 shows the hysteresis I–H
curves of the cast Fe
72Al5Ga2P10C6B4Si1amor-
phous cylinder with a diameter of 2 mm, togetherwith the data of the cast Fe

phous sheets of 15 mm in width were also shown for comparison.294 INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS1.14 T, 0.5 A/m and 0.38, respectively. In compari-
son with those [66] for the Fe–Al–Ga–P–C–B cylin-
der, Hcdecreases and Ir/Isincreases for the Si-
containing amorphous cylinder, though Isdecreases
slightly owing to the slightly lower Fe concen-
tration. From the thermomagnetic data, it has been
conﬁrmed that the cast Fe 73Al5Ga2P11C5B4amor-
phous cylinder has a Tcat about 600 K which is
lower by about 185 K than the crystallization tem-
perature. The Tcvalue agrees with that determined
from the endothermic peak on the DSC curve. It isthus concluded that the cast Fe-based amorphouscylinders with diameters up to 2 mm exhibit good
soft magnetic properties of 1.1 T for I
s, 2–6 A/mforHcand 7000 for meat 1 kHz. When these soft
magnetic properties are compared with those for
the corresponding melt-spun amorphous ribbons,
no distinct changes in IsandHcare seen. However,
themevalue is degraded for the cast cylinder pre-
sumably because of the increase in the inﬂuence of
the demagnetization resulting from the signiﬁcantchange in the sample morphology.

3 and 5 mm [68]. These samples have smooth outer
surfaces and metallic luster. No contrast of crystal-
line phase is seen over the whole outer surface. TheX-ray di/C128raction patterns showed a main halo peak

observed even for the 5 mm sample. Besides, theoptical micrographs of the cross-section of the
two samples also revealed a featureless contrast in
an etched state using hydroﬂuoric acid. Theseresults indicate that the bulk cylinders are com-
posed of an amorphous phase in the diameter
range up to 5 mm. Considering that the bulk cylin-der of 7 mm in diameter consists of an amorphous
phase in an outer surface region with a thickness
of about 2 mm and of amorphous and crystallinephases in the inner region, the t
max for the
Fe61Co7Zr10Mo 5W2B15alloy is determined to be
about 6 mm. It is noticed that the tmax is
three times larger than the largest value (2 mmfor Fe

B15cylinders with diameters of 1–3 mm [68]. These
amorphous alloys exhibit the sequential transition
of glass transition, supercooled liquid and crystalli-zation. The DT
xvalue is as large as 55–88 K and
the crystallization occurs by a single exothermic
reaction. The crystallites were identiﬁed to consist
of Fe, Fe 2Zr, Fe 3B, MoB and W 2B phases for the
Fe60Co8Zr10Mo 5W2B15sample heated to a tempera-
ture just above the exothermic peak. The crystalli-
zation is due to the simultaneous precipitation ofthe ﬁve crystalline phases. This crystallization mode
is in agreement with that [62,66] for other bulk
amorphous alloys. The largest DT
xis 88 K for
Fe56Co7Ni7Zr8Ta2B20, being larger than the largest
values (57–67 K) for Fe–(Al,Ga)–(P,C,B,Si)[62,66,67] and nonferrous Pd- and Pt-based amor-
phous alloys [3].
Tg/Tmwas also evaluated. The Tmvalue was
measured at 1420 K for Fe 56Co7Ni7Zr10B20and
1416 K for Fe 61Co7Zr10Mo 5W2B15and Tg/Tmwas
evaluated to be 0.60 for the former alloy and 0.63
for the latter alloy. Considering that Tg/Tmis
0.54 for Fe 80P12B4Si4[59] and 0.57 for
Fe73Al5Ga2P11C4B4Si1[62], the present Tg/Tm
values are believed to be the highest among all Fe-
based amorphous alloys.

(Zr,Nb,Ta)–B [11,63–65] and Fe–Co–Zr–(Mo,W)–
B alloys [68]. These amorphous alloys exhibit good
soft magnetic properties in an annealed (800 K,300 s) state, i.e. high I
sof 0.74–0.96 T, low Hcof
1.1–3.2 A/m, high meof 12 000–25 000 and low ls
of 10–1410ÿ6. The Hcandmevalues are superior
to those for conventional Fe–Si–B amorphous rib-
bons [60,61], presumably because of the lower ls.
Furthermore, the Fe 60Co8Zr10Mo 5W2B15bulk
amorphous alloy has high sc,fof 3800 MPa and Hv
of 1360 which exceed largely those sc,f
1000–2000 MPa,Hv300–800[33] for high-car-

3000 MPa for s
c,fand 1000 for Hvhave been
obtained for any kinds of Fe-based alloys includingamorphous and crystalline phases. Besides, no
weight loss is detected after immersion for 3.6 ks at
298 K in aqua regia. It is therefore concluded thatthe Fe-based bulk amorphous alloys possess simul-
taneously high GFA, high strength, high corrosion
resistance and good soft magnetic properties, whichcannot be obtained for other amorphous and crys-talline alloys.

The single-stage crystallization mode typical for
bulk amorphous alloys also implies that the amor-

amorphous phase is formed in the satisfaction ofthe four following criteria [69]:
1. multistage crystallization process;
2. existence of homogeneous nucleation sites in an
amorphous phase;
3. suppression of growth reaction caused by segre-
gation of a solute element with low atomic di/C128u-sivity at the nanocrystal/amorphous interface;
and
4. high thermal stability of the remaining amor-
phous phase by the enrichment of solute el-ements from the primary crystalline phase.
With the aim of changing the single-stage crystalli-
zation mode to the nanocrystallization mode in themaintenance of the supercooled liquid region, weexamined the e/C128ect of additional M (M=Ag, Ti,Nb, Pd, Au or Pt) elements on the formation of thenanocrystalline structure for the Zr–Al–Ni–Cuamorphous alloys [70–73]. The additional elementswere chosen because of positive heats of mixing(DH
mix) against the other constituent elements for
Ag and Nb, a nearly zero DHmixagainst Zr for Ti,
and extremely large negative DHmixagainst Zr for
Pd, Au and Pt [32]. The addition of the elementswith positive, nearly zero and largely negativevalues of DH
mixcauses the deviation of the three
empirical rules in the alloy components. As a result,microscopic heterogeneity in the structure and alloycomponent generates, leading to the precipitation ofa primary crystalline phase from the amorphousmatrix.
Figure 27 shows the DSC curves of the Zr–Al–
Ni–Cu amorphous alloys containing Ag, Ti or Pd,together with the data of the Zr–Al–Ni–Cu alloy.The addition of all the elements causes the change
from the single-stage crystallization mode to the
two-stage crystallization mode in the maintenanceof the supercooled liquid region before crystalliza-tion. The structure of the alloys annealed for di/C128er-ent periods at the temperatures just below the onsettemperature of the ﬁrst exothermic reaction ( T
x1)
was examined by TEM. As shown in Fig. 28, thePd- and Ti-containing alloys consist of nanoscalecrystalline precipitates embedded in the amorphousmatrix, indicating the e/C128ectiveness of the additionalelements on the formation of the nanostructuredamorphous phase. The precipitates appear to havea spherical morphology and their particle size ismeasured to be 5–10 nm for the Pd-containing alloyand 10–15 nm for the Ti-containing alloy.Furthermore, the redistribution behavior of alloycomponents by the precipitation of the primarycrystalline phase was examined for the Ag-, Nb-and Pd-containing alloys by the nanobeam EDStechnique. The EDS proﬁles indicate a common fea-
ture that the Al element, which plays a dominant
role in the high stability of the supercooled liquid,is enriched into the remaining amorphous phaseaccompanying the signiﬁcant segregation of Al in
the amorphous phase just near the nanocrystal/amorphous interface. This is consistent with theprevious interpretation that the redistribution of Alaround Zr is essential for the progress of crystalliza-tion for the Zr–Al–Ni–Cu amorphous alloys.
The precipitation behavior of the nanoscale
Zr
2Cu phase was also examined by some kinetic
analyses [73]. Figure 29 shows the change in theﬁrst exothermic peak due to the precipitation of theZr
2(Cu,Pd) phase during isothermal annealing at
di/C128erent temperatures for the Zr 60Al10Cu20Pd10
amorphous alloy. With increasing annealing tem-
perature, the peak position shifts to a shorter time
side and the peak intensity increases monotonously.
Fig. 27. DSC curves of Zr–Al–Ti–Ni–Cu and Zr–Al–Cu–
Pd amorphous alloys.INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS 297The transformation ratio ( y) corresponding to the
crystalline fraction ( Vf), from the amorphous to
Zr2Cu phase as a function of isothermal annealing
time ( ta) excluding the incubation time, increases
along the sigmoidal curve. The yvalues between 0.1
and 0.9 were used for the subsequent analysis in the
framework of the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami equation[74]. In the relationship between lnÿln1ÿyand
logtat various annealing temperatures, a good lin-
ear correlation is recognized at all annealing tem-
peratures and the slope corresponds to the Avramiexponent (the nvalue). The nvalue is evaluated to
be 3.4–3.6. The nvalue allows us to presume that
the crystallization proceeds by the di/C128usion-con-
trolled growth reaction in which all precipitatesgrowing from small dimensions have an increasingnucleation rate [75,76]. We also measured the acti-
vation energy for the ﬁrst-stage crystallization
reaction corresponding to the precipitation ofthe nanocrystalline phase by the Arrhenius plot ofthe isothermal annealing data and the Kissinger
plot of the continuous heating data. The activation
energy is 3.2–3.6 eV, which is much larger thanthose (1.9–2.2 eV) for the Zr–Al–Ni–Cu andZr–Al–Cu alloys without nanocrystalline phase, in-
dicating that the formation of the nanostructure is
partly due to the diculty of the crystallizationreaction caused by the necessity of the much higheractivation energies.8.2. Mechanism for formation of the nanostructured
amorphous phase
It has been reported that the crystallized structure
of the Zr
65Al7.5Cu27.5alloy caused by the poly-
morphic reaction consists of Zr 2Cu phase with large
grain sizes of 400–500 nm, while the addition of Pd
or Au decreases drastically the grain size of the
Zr2(Cu,Pd) phase to less than 10 nm [71,73]. The
high-resolution TEM and nanobeam EDX analysesreveal that the Pd and Au are dissolved into theZr
2Cu phase and the Al is rejected from the com-
pound phase and segregated into the remaining
amorphous phase. The Avrami exponent values in-dicate that the nanocrystallization of the Pd- andAu-containing alloys proceeds by the di/C128usion-con-trolled growth reaction in which all precipitates

peratures for Zr

nucleation rate. We have also shown that the acti-
vation energy for the ﬁrst-stage crystallizationreaction corresponding to the precipitation ofthe nanocrystalline phase is 3.2–3.6 eV for the
Zr
60Al10Cu20Pd10alloy and 3.2–3.8 eV for the
Zr60Al10Cu22Au8alloy, which are much larger than
that value (1.9–2.2 eV) for the Zr–Al–Cu ternaryalloy. Based on the above-described experimental
results on the structural and kinetic analyses of
crystallization, the formation process of the nano-scale Zr
2(Cu,Pd) phase surrounded by a residual
amorphous phase upon partial crystallization of the
Zr–Al–Cu–Pd amorphous alloys is schematicallyshown in Fig. 30 [73]. It is generally known that theformation of a nanostructure from an amorphous
phase requires the four criteria described in Section
8.1. The addition of Pd or Au with much largernegative DH
mixagainst Zr causes the change of the
crystallization mode from the single stage to the
two stages as well as the homogeneous generation
of Zr–Pd-rich clusters, which can act as a nuclea-tion site of the Zr 2(Cu,Pd) phase. The subsequent
growth of the Zr–Pd-rich cluster is also dicult
because of the enrichment of Al in the remaining
amorphous phase near the interface between amor-phous and Zr
2(Cu,Pd) phases resulting from the
elimination of Al from the Zr 2(Cu,Pd) phase. The
diculty of the growth reaction seems to result inthe high activation energy for the precipitation of
the Zr
2(Cu,Pd) phase. Furthermore, the enrichment
of Al also induces an increase of the thermal stab-ility of the remaining amorphous phase against
crystallization. The increase of the thermal stability
also plays an important role in the maintenance ofthe nanoscale size of the primary crystalline phase.
8.3. Mechanical properties and deformation behavior
of bulk nanostructured amorphous alloys
Figure 31 shows the s
f,EandHvas a function
of volume fraction ( Vf) of the primary crystalline
phase for the melt-spun Pd-containing alloy [73]subjected to heating for di/C128erent periods at a tem-

region, followed by water-quenching. With increas-ingV

wide Vfrange up to about 75% where good bend-
ing ductility is maintained. However, the transition
from ductile to brittle nature at Vf75%causes a
signiﬁcant decrease in Vf, though EandHvincrease
further. It is noticed that good ductility is main-
tained even in the high Vfrange up to 75%. The
similar changes in sf,Eand Hvwith Vfare also
recognized for the cast bulk nanostructured amor-
phous alloys containing Pd, as shown in Fig. 32.However, the ductile/brittle transition occurs atsmall V
fof 30–40% and the linear increase in Vf
stops in the vicinity of the transitional Vfvalue.
The maximum increasing amount in Vfis approxi-

alloy.INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS 299mately 30% and the highest Vfis 1980 MPa for the
Pd-containing alloy. The Vfof the mixed-phase
alloy has been interpreted by the simple mixturerule between the amorphous matrix and the nano-scale compound. Tensile fracture occurs along themaximum shear plane, which is declined by about
458to the direction of tensile load and the fracture
surface consists mainly of a vein pattern, as exem-pliﬁed by the Pd-containing alloy in Fig. 33. Thereis no distinct di/C128erence in the feature of tensile frac-
ture behavior between the bulk nanostructured
amorphous alloys and amorphous single-phasealloys. The similar fracture mode indicates that theintergranular amorphous phase keeps good ductilenature and the fracture occurs preferentially along
the intergranular amorphous region, as illustrated
in Fig. 34. The shear deformation, which is limitedto the narrow width of 20–30 nm, can be e/C128ectivelysuppressed by the nanocrystalline (compound) par-
ticles with higher H
vand/or higher yield strength,
leading to the increase in Vf. In this deformation
and fracture mechanism, the remaining amorphousalloy must keep good ductility, which is comparableto the as-cast amorphous phase. The maintenance
of the good ductility seems to result from the re-sidual existence of the supercooled liquid region
before crystallization for the remaining amorphous
phase. The present annealing was made by heatingin the supercooled liquid region, followed by water-quenching, which is capable of introducing a large
amount of free volume. The decrease in the critical
V
fof the ductile/brittle transition for the bulk alloy
is presumably due to the diculty in the re-entranceof free volumes owing to much lower cooling rates
for the bulk alloys than for the ribbon alloys.
More recently, the good ductility of the bulk
nanostructured amorphous alloys has been con-
ﬁrmed by the appearance of slipping-o/C128-type frac-ture mode for the bulk sample subjected to acompressive test at room temperature [77]. As an
example, Fig. 35 shows the compressive stress–
elongation curves of the Zr
60Al10Cu20Pd10cylindri-
cal samples in as-cast amorphous single-phase andnanostructured amorphous-phase states. Although
the amorphous single-phase alloy exhibits a high
yield strength of 1770 MPa and a small plasticelongation of about 0.4%, the elongation increasesremarkably to about 2.5% for the nanostructured
amorphous alloy. The absence of data on the
stress–elongation curve in the larger elongation

specimen and results from damage to the strain
gauge used in the measurement. Figure 36 showsthe outer appearance of the nanostructured amor-
phous alloy subjected to the plastic elongation of
2.5%. A distinct slip step is seen along the maxi-mum shear plane, which is declined by about 50 8to
the direction of the uniaxial compressive load. We
have also conﬁrmed that the vein pattern in thefracture surface of the nanostructured amorphous
alloy is in a more developed and distinct state as
compared with the corresponding amorphoussingle-phase alloy. The more distinct vein pattern is
presumably because the shear sliding stress is loca-
lized to the intergranular amorphous-phase ﬁeldand the localization causes a more distinct slidingdeformation through the softening phenomenon
caused by the increase in temperature.
9. FORMATION AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
OF BULK-CLUSTERED AMORPHOUS ALLOYS
It was shown in the previous section that the
most important point in obtaining high Vffor the
mixed-phase alloys is attributed to the good duct-ility of the remaining amorphous phase. The above-
described nanostructured amorphous alloys were
obtained by annealing-induced partial crystalliza-tion in the supercooled liquid region, followed by
water-quenching. In addition to the annealing treat-
ment, as another route to producing the similarnanostructured amorphous structure, one can ob-serve a control method of cooling rate from the
liquid during casting into a bulk amorphous alloy.

biting improved mechanical properties.

as-cast amorphous and nanocrystalline mixed-phase states.INOUE: BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS 301The control method was expected to result in the
homogeneous dispersion of much smaller precipi-tates in an amorphous matrix containing a much
larger amount of free volume [47,78]. Figure 37
shows small-angle scattering X-ray di/C128raction pat-
terns of amorphous single phase and mixed phases
in the as-cast state for the Zr
60Al10Ni10Cu19Nb1
alloy. The mixed structure was produced by con-trolling the casting temperature. Some broad andlow-intensity di/C128raction peaks are seen at the pos-
itions corresponding to Zr
2Cu. From the high-resol-
ution TEM image taken from the mixed-structure
alloy, the compound phase has been identiﬁed to
have a grain size of about 4 nm and an interparticle
spacing of about 6 nm. The crystalline particles are
much smaller than those for the nanostructured
amorphous alloys obtained by annealing and hence
the structure obtained by the controlling process isnamed as a clustered amorphous alloy.
Figure 38 shows the ﬂexural stress–deﬂection
curves of the clustered amorphous Zr–Cu–Al–Ni–Nb alloy, together with the data of the correspond-
ing amorphous single and nanostructured alloys.
It is noticed that the bending ﬂexural strength
is 4300 MPa for the clustered amorphous
alloy, being much higher as compared with
2000 MPa for the amorphous single-phase alloy
and 3300 MPa for the nanostructured amorphousalloy. The V
fof the precipitates in the clustered
amorphous alloy is estimated to be 30%, which
is considerably smaller than that for the nano-
structured alloy, though the particle size is
much smaller. The remarkable increase in the
ﬂexural strength cannot be explained by the mixturerule. The reason for the increase in ﬂexural strength
is presumably due to the generation of residualcompressive stress in the amorphous region justnear the clustered particles resulting from the highcooling rate from the melt owing to the di/C128erence
in the coecients of thermal expansion between the
two phases [78]. The ﬁnding that the clusteredamorphous alloy with the extremely high strength isformed by control of the cooling rate is expected to

10. APPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Table 8 summarizes ﬁelds of application in which
the bulk amorphous alloys have expected uses. Asparticularly important application ﬁelds, one can
list machinery/structural materials, magnetic ma-
terials, acoustic materials, somatologic materials,optical machinery materials, sporting goods ma-
terials and electrode materials. Finally, it is pleasing
to introduce a successful example of a real appli-cation of bulk amorphous alloys as sporting goodsmaterials. As exempliﬁed in Fig. 39, the Zr–Al–Ni–
Cu and Zr–Ti–Al–Ni–Cu bulk amorphous alloys
have already been used as face materials in golfclubs [79, 80]. The practical use results from the ex-
perimental results that the Zr-based bulk amor-
phous alloys have simultaneously high tensilestrength, high bending strength, high hardness, high
fracture toughness, high impact fracture energy,
high fatigue strength, good castability, good cuttingmachinability and good corrosion resistance. Bulkamorphous alloys have also been tested as opticalmachinery materials (Zr–Al–Ni–Cu alloy) and as
an electrode material (Pd–Cu–Ni–P alloy) and areexpected to join the group of real application ma-
terials. Considering the recent signiﬁcant extension
of application ﬁelds, it is expected that the import-ance of bulk amorphous alloys as basic science and
