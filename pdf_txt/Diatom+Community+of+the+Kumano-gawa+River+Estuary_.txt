 Tabularia sinensis Yue Cao & al. (2018) was recently described from Poyang Lake, Jiangxi 
Province, the largest freshwater lake in China. The lake, with an almost circumneutral pH (7.4) and 
low conductivity 92 µS/cm), is connected to the lower and middle stretched Yangtze River and 
heavily used for navigation. This large (valve length up to ± 170 µm) species has several distinct 
morphological features that were not described previously for any Tabularia species. Synedra 
subgenus Tabularia Kützing (1844: 57) was raised to genus rank as the genus Tabularia (Kützing) 
D.M.Williams & Round (1986). Three different groups were separated within Tabularia, one 
typified by Tabularia barbatula (Kützing) D.M.Williams & Round, another by T. investiens 
(W.Smith) D.M.Williams & Round and the third that included all taxa in the Tabularia fasciculata 
(C.Agardh) D.M.Williams & Round complex. Cao & al. (2018), having unidentified specimens of a 
possible Tabularia species, undertook a cladistic analysis of 16 morphological characters to 
establish which of the three groups T. sinensis belonged. Tabularia, as presently constituted, is 
clearly paraphyletic and in need of revision. The analysis showed that T. sinensis could be 
considered a species of Tabularia, which may, of course, change when monophyletic taxa within Tabularia are delineated.  
Tabularia sinensis possesses very short striae (13–15 in 10 µm) composed of up to 7 (at the apices) 
transapically elongated, slit-like areolae covered each by a singular simple closing plate (see Cao & 
al. 2018, figs 23, 25). This high number of areolae is only observed at the apices as on the rest of 
the valve, only one to occasionally two areolae are found in each stria. This stria structure differs markedly from all other Tabularia species so far described (see for instance Williams & Round 
1986, Snoeijs & Kuylenstierna 1991, Harper & al. 2009). Two short but robust spines are located on the valve apices, overhanging the quite large sunken ocellulimbus.  
Despite the typical valve outline of this species in light microscopy and its large valve dimensions, 
records of T. sinensis in literature are scarce. Based on scarce published images in the literature, t he 
species has been reported from several freshwater Japanese localities, although always identified 
under a different name. Gotoh (1986) previous observed the species in the Kumano-gawa river 
estuary (Kii Peninsula in central Japan) in 1986 but identified and illustrated it as Synedra 
fasciculata (C.Agardh) Kützing. Ohtsuka (2002: fig. 270) illustrates a single valve from the Hii river, Honshu, Japan, but named it Tabularia tabulata (C.Agardh) Snoeijs. Ohtsuka & al. (2007: 
fig. 30) reported the species as Catacombas obtusa (Pantoczek) Snoeijs from another Japanese river 
(Ishite stream) illustrating a single valve showing the same valve outline (shape of the apices, short 
striae) as T. sinensis, indicating that the Japanese population should be identified as T. sinensis. 
Apart from these Japanese localities and the type locality in China, the species seemed to be 
restricted to eastern Asia.                                        No. 310 (30 November 2023) ISSN 2009-8987

	In 2018 and 2021, large populations of a long araphid taxon identified as an unknown Tabularia 
species were observed in several localities in Belgium and France. Detailed scanning electron 
microscopy observations showed the presence of very short striae composed of up to 2 slit-like 
areolae in most part of the valve, a large ocellulimbus and two overhanging spines. The 
valvocopulae was broad and lacking any poroids, a feature indicated in the cladistic analysis of Cao 
& al. (2018) as being solely present in T. sinensis. Apart from a slightly larger ocellulimbus and possible slightly broader virgae between the mantle striae, there are hardly any morphological 
differences observed between the European population and the valves in illustrated Cao et al. (2018: 
figs 1–21) prompting the hypothesis that the European valves should be identified as T. sinensis.  
A first population was observed in 2018 in the Seine River near Le Havre ( Seine-Maritime, France). 
The valves were somewhat shorter (<100 µm) than the Chinese type population, but the typical stria 
structure and valve outline confirmed the conspecificity. Three years later, a large population of 
much longer specimens (160–200 µm) of this species was observed in the Flemisch Zeekanaal 
Brussel-Schelde, a connecting canal between the Scheldt River and Brussels (Belgium), initially 
identified as Tabularia tabulata (Van de Vijver, pers. obs.) (Figs 1–13). In both European localities, 
the species was not observed before these dates but later surveys in the framework of water quality 
monitoring programs revealed multiple observations, indicating that the species is sp reading in 
western Europe (Quiniou, pers. obs.). The Seine and Flemish locality present comparable ecological 
data with pH value ranging from 7.1–9.3 and conductivity levels ranging from 600–870 µS/cm. 
The seemingly sudden appearance of this putatively Asian diatom in European waters raises some 
concern. In the recent past, several non -European established large populations in Europe. Coste & 
Ector (2000) described the presence of more than 10 ‘exotic’ diatom taxa that had appeared and 
were spreading in European rivers such as Reimeria uniseriata Sala, Guerrero & Ferrario. More 
recently, the spread of Achnanthidium delmontii Pérès, Le Cohu & Barthès in Central European 
rivers was documented by Buczkó & al. (2022) and more recently by Falasco & al. (2023). Some of 
these species seemingly arrived in Europe either by plant litter from botanical gardens (such as 
Diadesmis confervacea Kützing), or by the introduction of exotic aquatic animals such as tropical 
freshwater turtles [in the case of Encyonema triangulum (Ehrenberg) Kützing] or via the ballast 
water in ships (Cheniti & al. 2018). Most likely, the accidental introduction of Tabularia sinensis in 
European rivers is the result of exchange of ballast near European larger ports such as Le Havre (France) or Antwerp (Belgium). Both ports are connected by rivers and canals with inland European 
waters, and it is highly likely that extensive boat traffic on these rivers and canals is spreading the species further inland. It is unclear what the effect of this new introduction in European will have on 
the native diatom flora in these rivers, but it is already clear that that Tabularia sinensis is becoming 
dominant in the localities where it was first observed.  
This contribution is intended to highlight the existence of this alien species in European rivers, 
alerting environmental agencies of a new possibly invasive species in our native European floras.
