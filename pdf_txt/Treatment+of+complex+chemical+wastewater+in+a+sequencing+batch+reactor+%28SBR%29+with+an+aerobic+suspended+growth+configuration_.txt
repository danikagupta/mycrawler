Accepted 13 September  2017  Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology has found many applications  in industrial 
wastewater treatment in recent years. The aim of this study was to determine the 
optimal time for a cycle of the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and evaluate the 
performance of a SBR for petrochemical wastewater treatment in that cycle time. 
The reactor was operated with a suspended biomass configuration under aerobic 
cond itions. Carbon removal and operating parameters such as pH, temperature and 
dissolved oxygen (DO) were monitored during the wastewater treatment. The SBR 
was run at different cycle times and amongst the cycle times tested, the best 
performance was obtained  with a 7 h cycle time composed of a fill time of 15min, 
reaction of 6 h, settling of 30 min, and withdrawal of 15 min. The SBR with the 
determined cycle time was used to study the treatment of wastewater with various 
organic loading rates (12.88 gr  COD/L. d, 18.02 gr  COD/L.d and 31.39 gr COD/L.d). The 
SBR performance was evaluated by chemical oxygen demand (COD), total solids (TS) 
total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiencies. During the shock loading tests, the 
maximum COD, TS and TSS removal efficienc ies were 84%, 67% and 92%, 
respectively.  Keywords:

Petrochemical wastewater  
Optimum operation time  
  
1. Introduction  
Oil industries require large amounts of water for different 
purposes such as cooling [1]. Industrial wastewater such as 
petrochemical wastewater usually has a high COD, low 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and high total 
dissolved solids (TDS) as well as containing color, heavy 
metal and toxic materials. One of the economical and 
efficient me thods for controlling and protecting the 
environment is the biological treatment of industrial 
wastewater [2,3] . However, toxic materials in industrial 
wastewater have an inhibiting effect on the growth of 
microorganisms. B atch mode operations like sequencing 
batch reactors can be a viable solution for this problem [4].  
 SBR is a fill and draw type batch activated sludge process. 
Wastewater is added to the reactor in a time known as fill 
time. In the reaction time, the microorganisms under 
aerobic/anoxic conditions use the pollutant as substrate. In 
the settling time, the activated sludge is allowed to settle 
and the effluent is withdrawn from the reactor. In this process, equalization, aerat ion and sedimentation are 
done in the same tank, whereas in continuous flow 
systems, the operations are conventionally done in 
separate tanks [5-7]. The advantages of SBR include 
flexibility in sequence time, minimum space requirement, 
elimination of a clarifier, and no need for a sludge return 
pump; nonetheless, it has some disadvantages such as the 
need for frequent start/stop equipment and a higher 
pressure drop due to changing liquid levels [8,9] . Previous 
research has shown that SBR is a suitable activated sludge 
process for domestic wastewater treatment [7,8] . The SBR 
has shown relatively efficient performance compared to a 
conventional activated sludge s ystem in treating complex 
chemical effluent [4]. This system is useful for treating 
pharmaceutical [10], dairy [11,12] , brewery [13], 
petroleum refinery [3], wood fiber [14] and chemical 
wastes [4]. In this study, the treatment of actual 
petrochemical wastewater at varying organic  loading rates 
in a sequencing batch reactor was studied.

2. Material and methods  
2.1. Wastewater characteristics  
The wastewater used in this study was collected from an 
olefin plant in the Pars special economic zone in the south 
of Iran . This plant consumes ethane and naphtha as feed. 
The pollutants expected in the feed were components that 
were derived from steam cracking ethane and naphtha as 
saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, phenol and benzene.  
The characteristics of the feed are sho wn in Table 1.

2.2. SBR configuration and operation  
A sequencing batch reactor was fabricated from Plexiglas 
material. The reactor had an internal diameter of 13.5 cm 
and a height of 38.8 cm. The operating volume and 
working volume was 4.2 L and 3 L, respectively. A 
schematic diagram of the SBR system used in this study is 
shown in F igure1. The reactor was operated in suspended 
growth configuration in sequencing batch mode under 
aerobic conditions. Feeding, withdrawing and sludge waste 
were accomplished by gravitational force. The reactor was 
fed with 3 L of the olefin plant wastewater and the influent flow rate of feed was 3 L/d. The suspended biomass 
concentration of feed was 30 00 mg/L. The COD influent 
and SRT were 6280 mg/L and 10 days, respectively. Carbon 
removal and operating parameters such as temperature, 
pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were monitored during the 
wastewater treatment. The air supply was provided by an 
air comp ressor ( Resun ACO -010) with a constant flow of 
4.5 L/min.  Influent neutralization and pH was adjusted by 
sulfuric acid in the feed tank before feeding. The reactor 
was seeded by activated sludge prepared from an aerobic 
chamber of an industrial wastewater treatment plant 
located in the Pars special economic zone in the south of 
Iran. During the initial 20 days, the SBR was operated with 
no sludge withdrawal to acclimatize the microbial 
population to the wastewater. The cycle time and SRT was 
set at 10 days.  The mixed liquor suspended solids ( MLSS) 
at the start of the SBR operation was 3000 mg/L. Then for 
the first run, the r eactor was operated under the following 
conditions: 15min: fill, 23 h: reaction, 90 min: settling  and 
15 min: withdrawing cycle time. At the end of the aerobic 
period, the sludge was removed from the reactor to 
maintain sludge retention time (SRT) at 10 days. The 
temperature was almost constant at 22 Âºc. The variation of 
COD, pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and DO 
during the sequen ce were monitored. The ability of this 
system was tested by employing different organic loading 
rates (OLR) using the 3 synthetic samples presented in 
Table1.  The COD, TS and TSS removal efficiency was 
monitored at the end of each cycle .

2.3. Analysis  
All the analysis including COD (5220 D), TS (2540 B), TSS 
(2540D), MLSS (2540 G), TSS (2540 D), sludge value index 
(SVI) (2710D), Turbidity (2130 B), Dissolved Oxygen (DO) 
(4500 -O G. Electrode method), pH (4500 -H+ B, 
Electrometric method) and ORP (2580 B, Electrometric 
method) were carried out according to the Standard 
Methods for Water and Wastewater Examination [15]. 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Optimum time of aeration and settling phases  
Figure 2 shows the efficiency of COD removal. As shown in 
Figure 2, COD removal efficiency increased with rising 
aeration time up to 23 h, but the COD removal rate 
significantly decreased after 6 h of aeration.  With regards 
to the reduction of COD concentration in the early hours, 
the chemical compounds in the wastewater were not 
resistant to biodegradation.  Aeration is the main  
parameter in the cost operation, so a decrease in aeration 
time is very important. I ncreasing the aeration more than 
6 h till 23 h increased the energy consumption almost 4 
times, but the COD removal efficiency improved only 11%  
Based on this; 6 h was selected as the optimum aeration 
time. The COD removal efficiency increased to 61% in 6 
hours and thereafter gradually increased to  72% at the end 
of the SBR cycle. The variation of turbidity with settling 
time was measured. Fig ure 3 shows the effect of settling 
time on the turbidity of the effluent. Based on the 
standard of treated wastewate r in Iran (Nephlometric 
turbidity unit (NTU) <20 NTU), the optimum settling time 
selected was 30 minutes. The minimum time for fill and 
withdrawal was 15 min, so the optimum cycle time 
achieved was  15min: fill, 6 h: reaction, 30 min: settling, 
and 15 min: withdrawal . Thus, the total cycle time result 
was 7 h and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 9.8 h. 
At this time, the COD efficiency reached 61%. Effluent 
turbidity, TS and TSS were 17.9NTU, 70 mg/L and 50 mg/L, 
respectively. The DO concentration in th e reactor was kept 
above 3 mg/L throughout the SBR cycle.  For comparison of 
the results we were drawing out the related data from 
literature and presented in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, 
the initial effluent of COD concentration in this research 
with 6280  mg/L was greater than the other works. The 
high removal efficiency achieved in the Andereottola and 
Hudson study was due to its low COD in the feed 1400 and 
1500 mg/L respectively and the high cycle time of 
operation 12 and 24 respectively.  Fig. 2. COD removal efficiency during cycle operation

4. Conclusions  
In this research the performance of sequencing batch 
reactor on COD removal of petrochemical wastewater was 
investigated and the operation parameters were 
optimized.   The optimum cycle time for the sequences of 
SBR was  15min: fill, 6 h: reaction (aeration), 30 min: 
settling and 15 min: withdrawal . Furthermore, SBR 
efficiency in the achieved time and at different organic 
loading rates resulted in the removal of COD: 84%, TS : 67% 
and TSS: 92%. It can be concluded that the response of SBR 
to the variation of the organic load rate of wastewater was 
acceptable. Whereas the reduction of total time of 
operation is an effective economical factor (increasing the 
aeration time up to four times), this strategy for treatment 
of petrochemical wastewater is comparable with another 
works.
