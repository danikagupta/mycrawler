ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
Multivariate Statistical Process Contro l (MSPC) technique has been widely 
used for fault detection and diagnosis (F DD). Currently, contribu tion plots are used 
as basic tools for fault diagnosis in MSPC  approaches. This pl ot does not exactly 
diagnose the fault, it just provides greater insight into possible causes and thereby 
narrow down the search. Hence, the cause of the faults cannot be found in a 
straightforward manner. Therefore, this  study is conducted to introduce a new 
approach for detecting and diagnosing fault via correlati on technique. The correlation 
coefficient is determined using multivariate analysis techniques, namely Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Corre lation Analysis (PCorrA). An industrial 
precut multicomponent distillation column is used as a unit operation in this research. 
The column model is developed using Matla b 6.1. Individual charting technique such 
as Shewhart, Exponential Weight Movi ng Average (EWMA) and Moving Average 
and Moving Range (MAMR) charts are used to facilitate the FDD. Based on the results obtained from this study, the efficiency  of Shewhart chart in detecting faults 
for both quality variables (Oleic acid, x
c8 and linoleic acid, x c9) are 100%, which is 
better than EWMA (75% for x c8 and 77.5% for x c9) and MAMR (63.8% for x c8 and 
70% for x c9). The percentage of exact faults diagnoses using PCorrA technique in 
developing the control limits for Shewhart  chart is 100% while using PCA is 87.5%. 
It shows that the implementation of PCorrA  technique is better than PCA technique. 
Therefore, the usage of PCorrA technique in Shewhart chart for fault detection and 
diagnosis gives the best for it has the highest fault detection and diagnosis efficiency.

ABSTRAK 
 
 
 
Proses Kawalan Statistik Multipembolehubah ( MSPC) digunakan secara 
meluas untuk mengesan dan mengenalpasti pun ca kesilapan. Pada masa kini, carta 
penyumbang digunakan untuk mengenalpasti punca kesilapan dalam MSPC . Carta 
ini tidak dapat mengenalpas ti punca kesilapan dengan tepat yang mana ia sekadar 
menunjukkan kemungkinan besar punca kesi lapan dan membantu memudahkan 
pencarian punca kesilapan. Oleh itu, punca kesilapan tidak dapat ditentukan secara 
langsung. Justeru, kajian ini telah dijalankan bagi memperkenalkan satu pendekatan 
baru untuk mengesan dan mengenalpasti punc a kesilapan melalui teknik korelasi. 
Pekali korelasi ditentukan melalui kaedah Analisis Statistik Multipembolehubah iaitu 
Analisis Komponen Utama (PCA)  dan Analisis Korelasi Separa (PCorrA) . Turus 
penyulingan multikomponen industri digunakan sebagai operasi unit. Model turus ini dibangunkan menggunakan perisian Matlab 6.1.  Teknik carta individu yang terdiri 
daripada Shewhart, Exponential Weight Mo ving Average (EWMA) , dan Moving 
Average  dan Moving Range (MAMR)  digunakan bagi mengesan dan mengenalpasti 
punca kesilapan. Berdasarkan kepada keput usan yang diperolehi, kecekapan carta 
Shewhart dalam mengesan kesilapan untuk kedua-dua pembolehubah kualiti (Asid 
oliek, x
c8 dan asid linoleik, x c9) adalah 100% yang mana lebih baik berbanding 
dengan carta EWMA  (75% bagi x c8 and 77.5% bagi x c9)dan carta MAMR (63.8% bagi 
xc8 and 70% bagi x c9). Peratusan mengenalpasti punc a kesilapan secara tepat 
menggunakan teknik PCorrA bagi carta Sh ewhart adalah 100% manakala PCA 
adalah 87.5%. Ini menunjukkan bahawa pe nggunaan teknik PCorrA adalah lebih 
baik berbanding teknik PCA. Oleh itu, penggunaan teknik PCorrA dalam carta 
Shewhart bagi tujuan mengesan dan mengenalpasti punca kesilapan adalah yang 
terbaik dengan peratusan kecekapan yang paling tinggi.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
A major technological challenge facing th e processing industr ies is the need 
to produce consistently high quality product. This is partic ularly challenging in high 
demanding situations where processes are subj ect to varying raw ma terial properties, 
changing market needs and fluctuating ope rating conditions due to equipment or 
process degradation. The need to provide industry with techniques, which enhance 
process performance, will re quire new methodologies to be adopted that are capable 
of being used across a spectrum of industr ial processing operations and on a wide 
range of products (Simoglou et al. , 2000).  
 
Modern industrial processes typica lly have a large number of operating 
variables under closed loop c ontrol. These loops used to compensate for many types 
of disturbances and to counteract the effect of set point change. This is necessary to 
achieve high product quality and to m eet production standards. Although these 
controllers can handle many t ypes of disturbances, there are faults in the process 
such as line blockage, line leakage, sensor fault, valve fault and controller fault that 
cannot be handled adequately. In  order to ensure that pro cess is operating at normal 
operating condition as required, faults must  be detected, diagnosed and removed. 
These activities, and their management, are called as Statistical Process Control, SPC 
(Miletic et al., 2004).   2
The combination of Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts and multivariate 
analysis approach is used for Fault Det ection and Diagnosis (FDD) in the chemical 
process. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Correlation Analysis 
(PCorrA) are the techniques us ed in this study. A precut multicomponent distillation 
column that has been instal led with controllers  is used as the study unit operation.  
Improved Statistical Process Control method is implemented to detect and diagnose 
various kinds of faults, which occur in the process.  
 
 
 
1.2 Research Background 
 
Statistical methods are used to monito r the performance of the process over 
time in order to detect any process shifts from the target. Most of Statistical Process 
Control (SPC) techniques involve operations  on single response variables such as 
weight, pH, temperature, specific grav ity, concentration and pressure. This 
traditional SPC is used to monitor and verify that the process remains in statistical 
control based on small number of variables. The state of statistical control means that 
the process or product variables remain close to the target. Normally the fault in the 
process is seek through the usage of SPC  chart, i.e., the final product quality 
variables. Measuring quality variables al one are not enough to describe the process 
performance (Kourti et al., 1996). In this study, both quality variables and process 
variables are monitored. This can be done by developing the correlation coefficient 
between quality variables and process variables using multivariate analysis 
technique. In traditional SPC, once the qual ity variables detected out of statistical 
control signal, it is then left up to proce ss operators and engineers to try to diagnose 
the cause of out of control using their process knowledge (M acGregor and Kourti, 
1995). 
 
Chemical processes are becoming better instrumented with the advances of 
process sensors and data acquisition systems. There are massive amount of data being collected continuously and these variables are often correlated. Multivariate 
statistical analysis has been  developed in order to extr act useful information from 
process data and utilize it for process monitoring (Kresta et al ., 1991). Normally,  3
multivariate statistical analysis techni que is combined with SPC chart using 
Hotelling’ s T2 and Q  statistics to plot the graph for fault detection and diagnosis. 
Even though this conventiona l method provides good results for fault detection, there 
is difficulty in applying this method to di agnose faults because it does not provide a 
causal description of the process that can be used as the basis for fault diagnosis. 
Currently, contribution plots ar e used as the basic tools for fault diagnosis in the 
multivariate statistical approaches. Howeve r, this plot cannot exactly diagnose the 
cause but it just provides gr eater insight into possible cau ses and thereby narrows the 
search. The cause of the faults cannot be found in a straightforward manner. 
 
To overcome the limitation of contribution plot using multivariate analysis 
technique to diagnose fault, Improved SPC chart is introduced in this study. 
Multivariate analysis approach is applied in the SPC realm procedure to detect and 
diagnose the faulty condition in different approach. The multivariate analysis method 
is used to develop the control limits of  SPC charts. The correlation coefficient 
calculated from multivariate analysis techniqu e is applied to improve the SPC chart. 
The quality variables data is incorporated  in the control chart during the faulty 
condition for fault detection purpose, while  the process variables which has been 
correlated with the quality variables is used for fault diagnosis. Therefore, the 
Improve SPC charts applied is not only fo r quality variables but also for process 
variables. By monitoring the process vari ables, the cause of faulty condition, which 
affects the quality variables, could be identified directly. This will help the operator 
to take proper action immediately afte r faults exist in the process.

1.3 Objectives of the Research 
 
1. To determine the performance of the Improved Statistical Process Control 
charts; which are Shewhart individu al and Shewhart range, Exponential 
Weight Moving Average (EWMA) and Moving Average and Moving 
Range (MAMR) chart for fault detection. 
2. To utilize multivariate analysis technique, Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA), and Partial Correlation Anal ysis (PCorrA), for developing the 
relationship between the process variab le(s) and the quality variable(s) for 
fault diagnosis. 
 
 
 
1.4 Scopes of the Research 
 
The scopes of the research are: 
 
1. A simulated precut multicomponent distillation column model from the literature is used  as a case study. The model consists of 
controllers with vari ous kinds of disturbances and operating 
conditions. 
2. A set of Normal Operating Conditi on (NOC) data and a set of Out 
of Control (OC) data are generated using this simulated distillation 
column. 
3. Normal operating statistical model is developed using the multivariate techniques, PCA and PCorrA via correlation 
coefficient approach between the qua lity variable(s) and the process 
variable(s). 
4. The Shewhart individual and Shewhart range, Exponential Weight 
Moving Average (EWMA), and Moving Average and Moving 
Range (MAMR) charts are developed.  
5. The faulty condition is incorporated into the process model in order to see the performance of the contro l charts to detect the fault(s) 
and to find the cause of the fault(s).    5
6. The results of fault detection an d diagnosis are then discussed 
further. 
 
 
 
1.5 Contributions of the Research 
 
In this research, a new approach known as Improved Statistical Process 
Control for fault detection and diagnosis  is introduced. Multivariate analysis 
technique, Principal Component Analysis , PCA and Partial Correlation Analysis, 
PCorrA are used to develop the correlati on coefficient between quality variables and 
process variables. This technique is inco rporated in the Improved SPC chart as a 
fault diagnosis tools to find the cause of the faulty c ondition. Improved SPC charts 
are applied for both quality variables a nd process variables which have been 
correlated with quality variables of interest. 
 
 
 
1.6 Chapter Summary 
 
This thesis contains seven chapters. The first chapter comprises of the 
introduction of the research, research background, objectives of th e research, scopes 
of the research and contributions of this research. Chapter 2 reviews the multivariate 
analysis techniques and the concept of multivariate analysis technique used in this 
study, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Correlation 
Analysis (PCorrA).  
 
Chapter 3 consists of the concept of Statistical Process Control, SPC chart, 
detail explanation on SPC charts; Shew hart, EWMA and MAMR and the way to 
construct these charts. This chapter also presents the implementation of multivariate analysis technique in SPC chart to develop Improve SPC chart.  
 
Chapter 4 expresses the reasons for c hoosing distillation column as the case 
study. This chapter also presents the dynami c modeling of the columns, formulation  6
of dynamic simulating algorithm, establis hment of dynamic simulation program, 
controller tuning and explanation on Au tomatic Process Control, APC time 
sampling. The performances of the written  simulation program are compared with 
HYSYS simulator. 
 
Chapter 5 mainly contains the procedur e for fault detection and diagnosis. 
This chapter contains variables selecti on to perform process fault detection and 
diagnosis, determination of SPC sampli ng time, generating of normal operating 
condition data, out of control data and th e development of correlation coefficient 
using PCA and PCorrA to re late the quality variables with process variables.  
 
Chapter 6 presents the result and disc ussion of the research. The results are 
systematically presented. Discussions are made on the performance of each 
Improved SPC chart to detect known fault in  the process and the efficiency of the 
proposed method to conduct fault diagnosi s with applicati on of multivariate 
statistical analysis. Chapter 7 contains  the conclusions of the research and 
suggestions to the future SPC research activities.
