Abstract : The aim of this study is to inve stigate the possibility of barley husk biom ass as an
alternative adsorbent for bisphenol A (BPA) removal from aqueous solution. Effect of various
parameters such as Contact time, pH, temperature, initial BPA concentration and adsorbent
dosage has been carried out in this study. Isotherm studies were conducted on a laboratory scale
and the data evaluated for compliance with Langmuir, Freundlich, Tekmin and Dubinin-
Radushkevich isotherm models. Equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir model. The
optimum conditions for the removal of BPA within the experiment range of variables studies
were 10 mg/L of initial BPA concentration, 5 g/L of adsorbent dose, pH value of 3 and 90 min
of contact time. Under these conditions the maximum removal efficiency was 98.9%. The
Pseudo-first order, pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used to
describe the kinetic data. The data were best fitted with  pseudo  second  order  kinetic  model.
Thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated and it was found to be spontaneous,
endothermic and physical adsorption in nature.
Keywords:  Bisphenol A, Biosorption, Barley husk, Equilibrium isotherms.
Introduction:
Bisphenol A (BPA, 2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) is an endocrine disrupting chemical has been widely
used for the production of polycarbonate plastics (PC), epoxy resins, plastic packaging, dental sealants and
water pipes(1-3). Analysis of BPA in urine samples showed that BPA is present in over 93% of the US
population(4). Upon exposure to heat, acid or base, ester bonds that link the BPA monomers in these plastic or
resin materials will be hydrolyzed, thus releasing BPA into the environment(5, 6). The concern about BPA has
risen in that BPA has estrogenic effect on animals at low doses(7). More importantly, BPA can possibly cause
breast cancer(8, 9). It has been recently demonstrated that BPA can leach out of these materials and contaminate
the environment(10-12). More than one million tons of BPA are annually produced in the world(13). As a
result, BPA is often detected in municipal and industrial wastewaters, sewage sludge and natural waters and
sediments(14, 15).  Due to its high bioactivity, ubiquitous nature, toxicity even at very low concentrations and
persistence in water, it appears very important to develop efficient methods to reduce the presence of BPA in
the environment and especially in aquatic systems(16, 17). Various methods like chemical, biological, Fenton,
nanofiltration membrane and photocatalytic procedures have been used in the removal of Phenolic compounds
in recent years(18, 19). But many kinds of Phenolic compounds cannot be completely eliminated by some
methods, which in fact caused incomplete degradation products with higher endocrine disrupting action(20).
Hence, it is urgent to develop a rapid and efficient treatment for the removal of phenolic compounds.
Adsorption is one of the simplest and widely used methods that can be applied to removal micropollutants from
water(21). Adsorption potential of selected activated carbons were tested and found that BPA was effectively

removed from aqueous solution(22, 23). However, the problem associated with the activated carbon decrease
the attraction of its application(24). Therefore, the researchers are trying to find a low-cost and effective
adsorbent. Recently, the various natural material such as Red mud, Banana peel, Apple residues, Orange peel,
Azolla and etc have been used as effective adsorbents to remove the organic pollutants(19, 25).
The barley husk is one agricultural residue which can be used as low-cost adsorbent(26). Recently, the
residues of barley husk are going to be greater and more available due to increase the tendency to consume the
vegetable oils in Iran and the entire world(27, 28). The residues of barley husk have been used as adsorbent in
several studies and have been indicated the acceptable results to remove the pollutants(29, 30).
The aim of the study was: (1) investigation of barley husk ability to remove the BPA from aqueous
solution, (2) fitting four kinetic models to analyze the experimental data, (3) determination of adsorption
behavior of BPA, (4) determination of impact of solution pH, contact time, initial BPA concentration and
biomass dosage on sorption.

water and then was oven dried at 105
 for 3 h. After drying, adsorbent were sieved to obtain particle size of
18 mesh prior to being used for adsorption studies.
Preparation of BPA solution
The BPA used in this study obtained from a Merck company in Germany and used without further
purification. The chemical structures and general data are displayed in Table 1, respectively. The BPA stock
solutions were prepared by dissolving accurately weighted BPA in distilled water to the concentration of 1000
mg/L and the experimental solutions concentrations were obtained by dilution.

Batch adsorption experiments:
All experiments were carried out with biosorbent samples (5 g/L) at 25 ◦C in 50 ml beakers in an IKA
magnetic stirrer operating at 200 rpm to elucidate the optimum conditions (pH, contact time and initial BPA
concentration). Before analysis of the BPA concentration, samples were centrifuged at 3600 rpm for solid–
liquid separation. Finally, the residual concentrations were measured by Uv-visible (DR5000) in λmax of 276
nm. The BPA adsorption capacities of biosorbent were determined at a certain time intervals (10, 20, 30, 45, 60,
75, 90, 120 and 150 min). The effect of pH on biosorption was studied by adjusting BPA solutions (25 mg/L) to
different pH values (3–11) and agitated with 5 g/L of biosorbent for 90 min. The BPA solutions were adjusted
to the required initial pH values with the addition of HCl or NaOH (0.1 M). BPA adsorption experiments were

Results and discussion:
Effect of contact time and initial BPA concentration on biosorption
The plot of removal efficiency at different contact times shown in Fig. 1 reveals a two-stage kinetic
process: a rapid initial adsorption during the first 45 min, followed by a longer period of much slower uptake.
The maximum removal efficiency was observed after 90 min, which was chosen as the experimental contact
time for this study. The rapid adsorption observed during the first 45 min was probably due to the abundant
availability of active sites on the barley husk  biomass surface, and with the gradual occupancy of these sites,
the adsorption became less efficient(32). Similar behaviour regarding the absorption of Phenol on beet pulp was
observed by Gulbeyi(20).

increasing of initial BPA concentrations in the range of 10–100 mg/L, but adsorption capacity (q e) increased
from 1.1 to 15.26 mg/g. Three consecutive mass transport steps are associated with the adsorption of solute
from solution by porous adsorbent(33). First, the adsorbate migrates through the solution, i.e., film diffusion,
followed by solute movement from particle surface into interior site by pore diffusion and finally the adsorbate
is adsorbed into the active sites at the interior of the adsorbent particle. This phenomenon takes relatively long
contact time. Sui et al(22). investigated the effect of initial concentration of Phenol on the biosorption of rice
husk. The qe increased from 1.41 to 16.64 mg/g with an increase in the Phenol concentration from 10 to 150
mg/L.
The pH of aqueous solution has been known as the most important variable affecting BPA adsorption
onto biosorbents. Fig. 3 clearly shows that dried barley husk biomass also exhibited maximum BPA removal
within the pH range of 3-5. A similar trend of pH effect was observed for the adsorption of phenol on azolla
filiculoides and lemna minor(19). Generally, solution pH affects the surface charge of adsorbent and degree of

Therefore, the adsorption decrease at high pH values due to ionization of adsorbate molecules. The reason could
be also due to the electrostatic repulsions between the negative surface charge and the BPA anions in
solution(34). While at acidic pH, the percentage removal was higher because BPA was undissociated and the
dispersion interaction predominated.
The increase of adsorbent dosage from 1 to 5 g/L causes an increase adsorption rate of 45% to 98.9.
This is due to the fact that, increase in adsorbent dosage increase area available for adsorption(35). At lower
adsorbent doses, increase in removal is proportional to the increase in adsorbent dose. At a Dianati et al(36).
observed that the amount of phenol adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent decreased with increase in adsorbent
mass. The amount of phenol adsorbed decreased from 18.11 to 2.5 mg/g for an increase in adsorbent
concentration from 1 to 8 g/L, whereas the percentage removal increased from 39.25% to 94.3%. They the
decrease in the amount of phenol adsorbed with increasing adsorbent mass was due to adsorption sites
remaining unsaturated during the adsorption reaction(30). This was due to the fact that as the dosage of
adsorbent was increased, there was a less commensurate increase in adsorption resulting from the lower
adsorptive capacity utilization of the adsorbent.Davoud Balarak et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research, 2016,9(5),pp 681-690. 684

Adsorption kinetics
In order to examine the mechanism and rate-controlling step in the overall adsorption process, three
kinetic models, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion, are adopted to investigate
the adsorption process[52-54].
The pseudo-first-order equation can be expressed as the following equation(25, 37):
Log (q e – qt) = log q e –
 t
Where q e and q t are the biosorption capacity (mg/g) at equilibrium and time t, respectively, k 1 is the constant
rate (L min-1) of pseudo first order kinetic model.
T h e v a l u e s o f k 1, calculated q e, experimental q e a n d R2 a r e p r e s e n t e d i n T a b l e 2 . F u r t h e r m o r e , t h e
experimental values of q e,exp (mg/g) are far from the calculated q e,cal (mg/g). This suggests that the pseudo-first-
order kinetic model is not suitable to describe the adsorption process.
The pseudo-second order kinetic model can be described as follows(38, 39):
  =
  +
Davoud Balarak et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research, 2016,9(5),pp 681-690. 685
Where q e is the biosorbed amount of BPA at equilibrium (mg/g) for the pseudo-second-order biosorption, q t is
the amount of biosorbed BPA at time t (mg/g) and k 2 is the pseudo-second-order kinetic constant rate
(g/mg/min). The q e and k 2 values can be obtained from the slope and intercept of plots of t/q t versus t which are
depicted in Fig. 4. The good linear plots of t/q t versus t at different concentrations with the correlation
coefficients (R2) higher than 0.997 suggest that adsorption of BPA onto Barley husk biomass follows the
pseudo second order kinetic model.
The intraparticle diffusion equation is written as follows(40):
qt = K t0.5 + C
Where C is the intercept which describes the foundry layer thickness and K (mg/g min1/2) is the rate constant of
intraparticle diffusion. According to results, values of coefficients of determination from Table 2 are also low.

Adsorption isotherms:
The Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models were used to describe
the relationship between the amount of BPA adsorbed and its equilibrium concentration in solutions.
The linear form of Langmuir equation can be written as follows(41):

Where C e(mg/L) is the concentration of BPA at equilibrium, q e (mg/g) is the amount of BPA adsorbed by the
barley husk at equilibrium, q m (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity corresponding to monolayer
coverage, and K L (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant.Pseudo-first order Pseudo-second order Intra-particle diffusion Con

In order to determine if the dsorption process is favorable or unfavorable, a dimensionless constant separation
factor or equilibrium parameter R L, is defined according to the following equation(42):
RL=
Where K L (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant and C 0 (mg/L) is the initial BPA concentration.
The linear form of Freundlich equation is given as(24):
Log q e=
 logCe + log KF
Where q e is the BPA concentration on barley husk at equilibrium , C e (mg/L) is the concentration of BPA  in
solution at equilibrium, K F and 1/n are Freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption
intensity, respectively .
 The linear form of Tempkin isotherm can be written as(43):
=Bln (A) + Bln (C e)
Where B=RT/b, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1).
A is the equilibrium binding constant and B is corresponding to the heat of sorption.
The linear form of Dubinin-Radushkevich (D–R) isotherm model can be seen below(44, 45):
Ln qe = ln q m−Kε2
Where K is a constant corresponding to the biosorption energy, q m the theoretical saturation capacity and ε is
the Polanyi potential which is calculated from equation below(46):
ε = RT ln (1 + 1/C e)
Where R (kJ mol−1 K−1) is the gas constant and T (K) is the absolute temperature. E was calculated from the K
value by the following relation(44, 45):
E = 1/ (2K) ½

monolayer adsorption on a surface containing a finite number of identical sites. The model assumes uniform
adsorption on the surface and no transmigration in the plane of the surface(47). The R L value indicates
adsorption process is irreversible when R L is 0; favorable when R L is between 0 and 1; linear when R L is 1; and
unfavorable when R L is greater than 1(38). The value of R L was found to be 0.512-0.955 and this again
confirmed that the Langmuir isotherm was favorable for adsorption of BPA onto the barley husk biomass under
the conditions used in this study. Higher value for K F indicates higher affinity for adsorbate and the values of
the empirical parameter 1/n lie between 0<1/n<1, indicating favorable adsorption. A similar result was reported
for the adsorption of bisphenol on Red mud and Azolla filiculides(1, 19).
The mean energy of adsorption is the free energy change when one mole of the ion is transferred to the
surface of the solid from infinity in the solution. Its value in the range of 1–8 kJ mol-1 indicates physical
adsorption, while its value in the range of 20–40 kJ mol-1 is indicative of the chemisorption(32). The value of E
was found to be 1.573 , 2.224 and 2.566 and this again confirmed that the physical adsorption was favorable for
adsorption of BPA onto the barley husk biomass under the conditions used in this study.Davoud Balarak et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research, 2016,9(5),pp 681-690. 687

Thermodynamic parameters
Thermodynamic parameters such as standard free energy ( ∆G0) standard enthalpy change ( ∆H0) and
standard entropy changes ( ∆S0) were calculated by using equilibrium constant (K0) change with temperature
(T). The free energy change can be determined by the following equation(48, 49).
∆G0 = -RT ln K
Where ∆G0 is the free energy change of sorption process (kJ/mol), K is the equilibrium constant, T is the
temperature in (K), R is the universal gas constant. The free energy change may be expressed in terms of
enthalpy change of sorption as a function of temperature as follows(50, 51):

where ∆H0 is the standard heat changes of the sorption, ∆S0 is the entropy change of sorption (KJ/mol). The
standard enthalpy and entropy changes values are evaluated from the slope and intercept of linear plot ln k
against 1/T. Thermodynamic parameter values for the sorption of BPA on barley husk and the values are
tabulated in Table 4. The negative values of free energy changes confirm the spontaneous nature of sorption of
BPA on barley husk and the positive values of ∆H0 confirm the sorption process of an endothermic nature. The
positive values show increased randomness at solid–solution interface during the sorption of BPA on the barley
husk.

Conclusion
This study investigated the adsorption of BPA from aqueous solutions onto dried Barley husk  biomass.
The solution pH played a significant role in influencing the capacity of an adsorbent towards BPA molecules.
An increase in the pH of solutions leads to an decrease in the sorption capacities of BPA on the sorbent under
study. The sorbed amounts of BPA increase with increase in contact time, reaching a maximum value after 90
min. The Langmuir isotherm was demonstrated to provide the best correlation for the adsorption of BPA. The
pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided the best correlation of the experimental data. The negative value of
∆G0confirms that the feasibility of the reaction and spontaneous nature of the adsorption. The study shows that
Barley husk biomass can be effectively used as adsorbent for the removal of BPA from aqueous solutions.
