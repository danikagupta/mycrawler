  FOREWORD
 
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is made up of four charter ag encies of the U.S. Department of 
Health  and Human Services (DHHS):  the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health; the 
National  Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institu tes of Heal th; the National 
Center  for Toxicological  Research (NCTR), Food and Drug Administration; and the National Institute for 
Occupational  Safety and Health (NIOSH), Centers for Disease Control.  In July 1981, the Carcinogenesis 
Bioassay  Testing Program,  NCI, was transferred to the NIEHS.   The NTP coordinates the relevant programs, 
staff,  and resources from these Public  Health Service agencies relating to basic and applied research and to 
biological assay development and validation. 
The NTP  develops, evaluates, and disseminates scientific information about potentially  toxic and hazardous 
chem icals.   This knowledge is used for protecting the health of the American people and for the primary 
prevention of disease. The studies described in this Technical Report  were performed under  the direction of the NIEHS and were 
conducted  in compliance with NTP laboratory health and safety  requirements and must  meet or exceed all 
applicable federal,  state, and local  health and safety regulations.  Animal care and use were in accordance 
with the Public Health Se rvice Poli cy on Humane Care and Use of Animals.  The prechronic and chronic 
studies  were  conducted in compliance with Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) Good Laboratory Practice 
Regulations,  and all aspects  of the chronic studies were subjected to retrospective quality assurance audits 
before being presented for public review. These studies are  designed and conducted  to characterize and evaluate the toxicologic potential, including 
carcinogenic  activity, of selected chemicals in laborat ory animals (usually two species, rats and mice). 
Chemicals  selected for NTP toxicol ogy and  carcinogenesis studies are chosen primarily on the bases of 
human  exposure, level of production, and chemical structure.  The interpretive conclusions presented in this 
Technical  Report are based only on the results of these  NTP studies.  Extrapolation  of these results to other 
species  and quantitative risk analyses for  humans require wider analyses  beyond the purview of these studies. 
Selection per se  is not an indicator of a chemical's carcinogenic potential.

ABSTRACT
 
1-AMINO-2,4-DIBROMOANTHRAQUINONE 
CAS No. 81-49-2 
Chemical Formula:  C14H7Br2NO2   Molecular Weight:  381.04 
Synonym:  ADBAQ 
1-Amino-2,4-dibro moanthraquinone isan anthraquinone -
derived vat dy e, a member of a class of inso luble dyes 
that are impregnated into t extile  fibers.  Five 
anthraquinone-derived  dyes with  representative  and 
diver se structures, as well as the parent chemical, 
anthraquinone, were selected fortoxicology andcarcino -
genesis evaluat ion. Similartothebenzidine dyeinitia -
tive, the rationale for selecting these vat dyes was to 
generate suffici enttoxicologicdatato permit more reliab le 
predictions of carcinogenicityto be madeon other ch emi-
cals in this class, thereby eliminatingor reducingthe nee d 
to study every anthraquinone dye. 1-Amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone is the last anthraquinone-
derived dye in this group to be studied. 
Groups  of male a nd female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthra-
quinone  (87% to 97% pure) for 13 weeks or for 9, 15 , 
or 24 months.  Because 1-amino- 2,4-dibromoanthra -
quinone was predicted to be carcinogenic ,these studie s 
were desig ned to evaluate the potential for tumor 
progr ession andregression. Absorption andexcretio n 
studies werec arried out in male F344/N rats. Geneti c 
toxicity was determined in vitro using Salmonella 
typhim urium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Extensive chemical analyses were 
performed to identify and characterize impurities of the 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanth raquinone used inthese studies . 
13-W EEK S TU DY IN R ATS 
Groups of 10maleand 10 female ratswere given0, 2,500 , 
5,000,  10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoan thraquinone infeed for 13 wee ks. Thes e 
levels  correspond to  approximately  150 to 3,200 mg 
1-amin o-2,4-dibromoan thraquinone/kg body weight per 
day for malesand to approximately 170 to 3,200 mg/kg 
for fema les. Chemical-related mortality waslimited to 
onemale andonefemale inthe50,000ppmgroups. Final 
mean bodyweights and body weight gains of all expose d 
groups of ratsweresignificantly lower than those of the 
controls. Feed consumption byallexposed groups was 
less than that by the controls  throughout  the study and 
generally decreased withincreasing exposureconcentra -
tion. Pink-red staining ofthefurandtailwasobserved in 
allexposed groups. Absolute andrelative liverweights of 
allexposed groups weregenerallysignificantlygreater 
than those of the controls.

Chemical-related  lesions were present in the liver, 
kidney,  and spleen of male and  female rats.  Nonneo-
plastic lesions in theliverincluded fociofhepatocellula r 
alteration,  diffuse  hepatocellular hypertrophy  (cyto-
megaly), hepatocellu lar cytoplasmic vacuolation, bile 
duct hyperplasia, inflammation, a nd pigmentation. 
These difference s wereobserved primarily inthe25,00 0 
and 50,000 ppm groups of males and females; the 
spectrum ofproliferative lesions ofthebileducts (hyper -
plasia, fibrosis, and necroti zingcholangitis) inthe 25,00 0 
and50,000 ppmgroups wasmorphologically consisten t 
withthelesion descri bedascholangiofibrosis. Pigm en-
tation was  present in the renal t ubule epithelium of all 
groups  of exposed rats; nuclear enlargement 
(karyomegaly)  was also pr esent in the renal tubule 
epithelium insome oftheexposedrats. Accumulation of 
hyaline  droplets  in the cytoplasm of the renal  tubule 
epithelium  and tubule lumina  was present in 2,500, 
5,000,  10,000,  and 25,000 ppm males.  Incidences  of 
hematop oiesis of the spleen in exposed groups of males 
and females  were increased compared to those in  the 
controls. 
13-W EEK STUDY IN MICE 
Groups  of 10  male and 10 female mice were given  0, 
2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm1-amin o-
2,4-dib romoanthraqui none in feed for 13 weeks. Thes e 
levels correspon d to approximately 500 to 10,600 mg 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinon e/kgbodyweight per 
dayfor malesand ap proximately 660 to 11,700 mg/kg 
per day for females.  There was no chemical-related 
mortality.   Feed  consumption and final mean body 
weigh ts of exposed groups were similar to those of the 
controls.   Red staining of  the fur was observed in all 
exposed groups. Absolute andrelative liver weights of 
the exposed groups were greater than those of the 
controls  except for the absolute liver weigh t of 
2,500ppmmales. Absolute andrelative kidney weight s 
of 25,000 and 50,000 ppmmales werelowe r than those 
of the controls. 
Chemical-related  lesions were limited to the livers of 
males and consisted of pigmentationof hepatocytes at all 
exposure concentrations and centrilobula rhepatocellula r 
hypertrophy at10,000, 25,000,and50,000 ppm. Mini-
malpigment was present in the liver of onefemale inthe 
25,000 ppmgroup and in one female in the 50,000 ppm 
group. 2-Y EAR STUDY IN RATS 
Groups of70male and70female ratswere given 0,5,000 , 
or 10,000ppm1-amino- 2,4-dibromoanthraquinone infeed 
for 103 weeks.  In addition, groups  of 50 male and 50 
female  rats were given 2,00 0 ppm 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone infeedfor104weeks. These 
exposure concentrations were approximat elyequal to 90, 
240, or 490 mg1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraqui none/k g 
body  weight for males and 110,  285,  or 600 mg/kg for 
females. Tenanimals from eachgroupwereevaluated for 
histopathology  at 9 months.  Additional groups of 
10 animals from the 0 and 10,000 ppm grou ps we re 
evaluated for histopathology at 15 months. 
Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, 
and Clinical Findings 
In the 2-year study ,survival ofthe10,000 ppmmales and 
females was significantly lower than that of the controls . 
Survivalof the 2,000 and 5,000 ppmgroups was similar 
tothat of the controls. During the last y earofthestudy , 
the mean body weights of exposed males  were 80% to 
91% those of  controls,  and the mean body weights of 
exposed females were 67% to 84% those of  controls. 
Feed consump tion among exposed groups was generally 
similar,  but w as less than that by controls.  The fur and 
urine of allexposed male and femal egroups were discol-
ored. 
Pathology Findings 
In the 2-year study, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinon e 
wasassociated withsignificant chemical-related increase s 
in the incidences of benign and malignan t neoplasms in 
the liver, larg e intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder of 
males and  females.  Chemical-related nonneoplastic 
proliferative  and degenerative lesions  occurred in the 
liver,kidney, urinary bladder, and forestomach of males 
and females. 
The inciden ces of foci of hepatoce llular alteration an d 
pigmentation in the liver of males and femal es were 
increased at the 9-month interim evaluation, and a 
hepatocellular  adenoma was present in one 5,000 pp m 
male. At the 15- month interim evaluation, 
hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) 
occurred in all males and nine females in the 
10,000 ppm groups. By the end of the 2-year study, 
hepatocellular  adenoma, carcinoma, cholangioma, o r 
cholangiocarcinoma were observed in males and

females  in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups.   In the 
2,000 ppmgroups, similar liverneoplasms were presen t 
in 63% of themales andin83% ofthefemales.  Of the 
hepatocellular carcinom asinthe5,000 and 10,000 ppm 
group s of males and females,31 % to 49% were meta-
static  to the  lungs or  other sites.  Increases in the inci-
dences of foci of hepatocellular alterati on (basophil ic, 
eosinophilic,and clear cell)andpigmentat ion of the liver 
were  also observed  in exposed groups of males and 
females. 
Adenomatouspolyps(adenoma)of the large intest ine 
were present in six 10,000ppmmales  at the 15-mo nth 
interim evaluation. Incidence s of ad enomatous polyp 
(adenoma)  and carcinoma of the large intestine  were 
significantly increased in exposed groups of males and 
females  after 2  years; multiple  benign and malignant 
intestinal neoplasms were observed  in many of  these 
rats. In the kidney, incidences of renal tubul e adenoma and 
carcinoma  were significantly increa sed in exposed 
groupsofmales andfemales after 2years. Renal tubul e 
adenomas  were  present in two 10,000  ppm males at 
15months. There were alsochemica l-relatedincrease s 
intheincidences and severities of renaltubule epithelia l 
hyperplasia, pigmentation, and transitional cell hyperpla -
siain thekidney ofmales andfemales. Hyaline droplet 
accumulation  was present in all exposed male  rats at 
9 months. 
Incidences of transitional cellpapilloma andcarcinom a 
of the urina rybladder were increased at 2 years in males 
andfemales inthe10,000 ppmgroups. Transitional cell 
hyper plasia was observed inexposed males andfemale s 
atthe15-month interim evaluation. Other nonneoplasti c 
lesions  observed in  the urinary bladder  at 2 years in-
cluded  metaplasia  of the transitional epithelium and 
submucosal stromal tissue. In the forestomach, the incidences and severities of 
inflam mation, ulceration, hyperkeratosis , and hyperpla -
sia of the squamous mucosa we re increased in all 
exposed groups of males and females at 2 years, but not 
at the 9- or 15-month interim evaluations. In exposed m ales and females, the incidences of 
mononuclearce ll leukemiaweresignif icantly decreased . 
The incidences of atrophyof the seminal vesicl e were 
increased in exposed male rats in the 2-year study. Stop-Exposure Evaluation in Rats 
Groups  of 40 male and 40 female rats wer e give n 
20,000 ppm1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed 
for 9 or 15 months.  At 9 months, 10 males and 10 fe-
maleswere evaluated forhistopat hology (9-month interi m 
evaluation  groups) .  After 9 months of exposure, an 
additional 10 males and 10 females were fed control diet 
until the end of the 15-month evaluation (9-month 
stop-exposure  groups),  and 20 males and  20 females 
continued to receive 20,000 ppm1-amino-2,4-d ibromo -
anthraquinone unt il the end of the evaluation (15-mont h 
exposure group s). Theapproximate daily consumption of 
1-amino-2,4-dibr omoanthraquinonewas 1,335 mg/kg for 
males and 1,790 mg/kg for females in the 9-mon th stop-
exposure  groups and 1,115 mg/k g for males and 
1,435  mg/kg f or females in the 15-month exposure 
groups. 
Survivalwassimilaramonggroupsexcept for the female s 
inthe15-monthexposure group; thesurviv al ofthisgroup 
was lower than that of the controls.  Lower mean body 
weights were related toincreased exposure duration. The 
mean bodyweights of exposed males were 76% to 82% 
that of controls, and the meanbod y weights of e xpose d 
females were 73% to 84% that of controls.  For the stop-ex posure evaluation, simila rchemical-relate d 
neoplasms and nonn eoplastic lesions were observe d in th e 
same  sites as in the 2-year study:  liver, large intestine, 
kidney, urinary bladder, and forestomach. After 9 monthsof dietar yexposure to aconcentration of 
20,000  ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibro moanthraquinone, 
hepatocellular adenoma andcarcinoma occurred inmales 
and femal es. Nonneoplast ic chemical-related lesions in 
the liver of exposed rats included  pigmentation, focal 
hepatocellular  alteration, and bile duct hyperplasia. 
Neoplasms at other sites inmales included oneadenoma -
tous polyp (adenoma) in the large intestine and one 
transitional cellpapilloma intheurinary bladder. Hyalin e 
droplet  accumulation was present in  the kidney  of ex-
posed males at 9 months.  In the stop-exposure groups examined at 15 months, 
hepatoce llular adenoma and carcinoma were presen t in

carcinoma  also occurred in males  and  females. 
Nonneoplastic chemical-related lesions included foci of 
hepatocellular alteration in the liver and hyperplasia of 
the renal tubulee pitheliumand urinary bladder transi -
tional epithelium. Hyper plasia, hyperker atosis, inflam -
mation,  and ulceration were observ ed in the 
forestoma chsofsome male andfemale ratscontinuousl y 
exposed for 15 months. 
2-Y EAR STUDY IN MICE 
Groups  of 60 male  and 60 female  mice were given 0, 
10,000,  or 20,000 ppm 1-amino -
2,4-di bromoanthraquino ne in feed for 104 weeks. The 
daily compou nd consumptionwas approximately 1,690 
or3,470 mg1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body 
weight for males and 1,950 or 4,350 mg/kg for females . 
Ten animals from each group were evaluat ed fo r 
histopathology at 15 months. 
Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption,
and Clinical Findings 
In the 2-year study, survival of exposed males was 
significantly lower thanthatofthecontrols. Survival of 
exposed females wassimilar tothatofthecontrols. The 
final meanbody weightsof exposed males were 83% to 
85% thatofcontrols, and the final mean body weights of 
exposed  females were 81% to  86%  that of controls. 
Feed  consumption by  exposed groups was  generally 
similar  to that by controls.  Discoloration of the fur, 
urine, and feces was observed in all exposed groups.  
Pathology Findings 
Inthe2-year study, 1-ami no-2,4-dibromoanthraquinon e 
was associated  with significant chemical-related in-
creases  in the incidences of benign and malignant 
neoplasms in the liver,forestomach,and lungof males 
and females. 
Incidencesof hep atocellular ad enoma and carcinom a 
were  incre ased in exposed groups at the 15-month 
interim evaluation andat2years. At2years, there were 
significant  increase s in the incidences of multiple 
hepatocellular  adenoma and carcinoma  in males and 
females  and in the incidences of hepatoblastoma in 
males.   Centrilobular  hypertrophy of  hepatocytes in 
malesan dfoci of hepatocellular alteration and pigmenta -
tion in the liver of mal es and  females were also 
chemical-related changes. Squamous  cell papilloma of the  forestomach mucosa 
occurr ed in 10,000 ppmfemalesand 20,000ppmmales 
and female s at the 15-monthinterim evaluat ion, and the 
incidences  of squamous cell pa pilloma and carcino ma 
were significantly increased in exposed groups of males 
andfema les at 2years. Chemica l-related hyperplasia of 
forestomach epitheliumwas also present at 15 monthsan d 
at 2 years. 
Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were present onlyinthe 
expo sed group s of malesand femalesat 15 months,an d 
the incidences  of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma were 
significantly increased in exposed males and females at 
2years. Theincidences ofmultiple alveolar/bronchiola r 
adenoma were also increased in exposed males.  In the kidney, pigmentation was  present in the renal 
tubules of most mice after 2 years of exposure. 
DISPOSITION 
AND METABOLISM STUDIES 
Adult  male F3 44/N rats were given [14C]-labeled 
1-am ino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone as a single intrave -
nous  dose of 0.4 mg/kg body weight or as a single  oral 
dose of 2, 23, 118, 814, or 1,473  mg/kg.  A 6-hour bile 
cannul ation study was also performed.  From day 0 
through day3 afterintravenous administrati on,about 50% 
of the 14Cwas excreted inthe feces, 15% inthe urine, an d 
6% in expired air. Unmetabolized 1-amino -
2,4-d ibromoanthraquinone accounted forless than 3% of 
the excreted14Cafterintrav enous administration. Fororal 
doses administered, the amount  of the dose that  was 
absorbed  fit the equation:  absorbed dose  = 6.6 
log(dose). After intravenous admi nistration, themetabo -
lites of 1-amino-2,4-d ibromoanthraqu inone inblood wer e 
prim arilyin the plasma fraction (bl ood:plasma ratio of 
approximately 0.5:1). Thehighest concentrationsof 14C 
in tissues 15 minutes  after intravenous dosing were in 
excretory  organs, lung,  kidney, small intestine,  liver, 
adipose tissue, and adrenal gland.  
GENETIC TOXICOLOGY 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  was mutagenic 
in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 andTA1537 in 
the absence of S9; with S9, an equivocal response was 
observed inTA1537. 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanth raquinon e

CONCLUSIONS 
Under theconditions of these 2-year feed studie s, ther e 
was clear evidence of ca rcinogenic activity*  of 
1-amino-2,4-d ibromoanthra quinone in male and femal e 
F344/Nrats based on increased inci dences of neoplasm s 
in the liver, large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder . 
There  was clear evidence of carcinogenic  activity of 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoant hraquinone in male andfemal e 
B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of 
neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung. Exposure  of male and fem ale rats to 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinonefor 2years wasassociated with 
basophilic focus (males only), clear cell focus, 
eosinophilic  focus, and pigmentation in the liver; renal 
tubule hyperplasia , renal tubule pigme ntation, andtransi -

EXPLANATION OF LEVELS OF EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENIC ACTIVITY 
The National Toxicology Program describes the results of individual experiments on a chemical agent and notes the strength of the 
evidence for conclusions regarding each study.  Negative results, in which the study animals do not have a greater incidence of 
neoplasia than control animals, do not necessarily mean that a chemical is not a carcinogen, inasmuch as the experiments are conducted under a limited set of conditions.  Positive results demonstrate that a chemical is carcinogenic for laboratory animals under the conditions of the study and indicate that exposure to the chemical has the potential for hazard to humans.  Other organizations, 
such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer, assign a strength of evidence for conclusions based on an examination of all 
available evidence, including animal studies such as those conducted by the NTP, epidemiologic studies, and estimates of exposure. Thus, the actual determination of risk to humans from chemicals found to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals requires a wider 
analysis that extends beyond the purview of these studies. 
Five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity are used in the Technical Report series to summarize the strength of the evidence 
observed in each experiment:  two categories for positive results ( clear evidence  and some evidence ); one category for uncertain 
findings ( equivocal evidence ); one category for no observable effects ( no evidence ); and one category for experiments that cannot 
be evaluated because of major flaws ( inadequate study ). These categories of interpretative conclusions were first adopted in June 
1983 and then revised in March 1986 for use in the Technical Report series to incorporate more specifically the concept of actual 
weight of evidence of carcinogenic activity.  For each separate experiment (male rats, female rats, male mice, female mice), one of the 
following five categories is selected to describe the findings.  These categories refer to the strength of the experimental evidence and not to potency or mechanism. 
•	 Clear evidence  of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that are interpreted as showing a dose-related 
(i) increase of malignant neoplasms, (ii) increase of a combination of malignant and benign neoplasms, or (iii) marked 
increase of benign neoplasms if there is an indication from this or other studies of the ability of such tumors to progress to 
malignancy. 
•	 Some evidence  of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that are interpreted as showing a
 
chemical-related increased incidence of neoplasms (malignant, benign, or combined) in which the strength of the
 response is less than that required for clear evidence.
 
•	 Equivocal evidence  of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that are interpreted as showing a marginal 
increase of neoplasms that may be chemical related. 
•	 No evidence  of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that are interpreted as showing no chemical-related 
increases in malignant or benign neoplasms. 
•	 Inadequate study  of carcinogenic activity is demonstrated by studies that, because of major qualitative or
 
quantitative limitations, cannot be interpreted as valid for showing either the presence or absence of carcinogenic
 activity.
 
When a conclusion statement for a particular experiment is selected, consideration must be given to key factors that would extend the 
actual boundary of an individual category of evidence.  Such consideration should allow for incorporation of scientific experience and 
current understanding of long-term carcinogenesis studies in laboratory animals, especially for those evaluations that may be on the 
borderline between two adjacent levels.  These considerations should include: 
• adequacy of the experimental design and conduct;
 
• occurrence of common versus uncommon neoplasia;
 
•	 progression (or lack thereof) from benign to malignant neoplasia as well as from preneoplastic to neoplastic lesions; 
•	 some benign neoplasms have the capacity to regress but others (of the same morphologic type) progress.  At present, 
it is impossible to identify the difference.  Therefore, where progression is known to be a possibility, the most prudent course is to assume that benign neoplasms of those types have the potential to become malignant; 
•	 combining benign and malignant tumor incidence known or thought to represent stages of progression in the same
 
organ or tissue;
 
•	 latency in tumor induction; 
•	 multiplicity in site-specific neoplasia; 
•	 metastases; 
•	 supporting information from proliferative lesions (hyperplasia) in the same site of neoplasia or in other experiments 
(same lesion in another sex or species); 
•	 presence or absence of dose relationships; 
•	 statistical significance of the observed tumor increase; 
•	 concurrent control tumor incidence as well as the historical control rate and variability for a specific neoplasm; 
•	 survival-adjusted analyses and false positive or false negative concerns; 
•	 structure-activity correlations; and 
•	 in some cases, genetic toxicology.  14 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

The members of the Technical Reports Review Subcommittee who evaluated the draft NTP Technical Report on 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone on June 21, 1994, are listed below.  Subcommittee members serve as independent scientists, not as 
representatives of any institution, company, or governmental agency.  In this capacity, subcommittee members have five major 
responsibilities in reviewing NTP studies: 
! to ascertain that all relevant literature data have been adequately cited and interpreted,
 
! to determine if the design and conditions of the NTP studies were appropriate,
 
! to ensure that the Technical Report presents the experimental results and conclusions fully and clearly,
 
! to judge the significance of the experimental results by scientific criteria, and
 
! to assess the evaluation of the evidence of carcinogenic activity and other observed toxic responses.

carcinogenesis studies of 1-amino-2,4-dibro moanthra -
quinone by discussingthe uses and rationale for study , 
including itbeing a partofa class study ofanthraquinon e 
derivatives.   He described the experi mental design, 
report ed on survival and body weight effects, and com -
mentedon chemical-related neoplas msand non neoplasti c 
lesions inmale andfemale ratsandmice. Thepropose d 
conclusions  for the studies were clear evidence of 
carcinogenic  activity in male and female F344/N rats 
and in male and female B6C3F1 mice. 
Dr.Huffr eviewed t he carcinogenic responses in other 
anthraquinone deriv ative s that had been studied, notin g 
that the liver seemed tobea major siteand that 1-amino -
2,4-dibr omoanthraquinone was the most active as far as 
thenumber ofsites. Interpre tiveconclusions thatcould 
be drawn from the cumulative National Toxicology 
Program studies on thisclass of insoluble dyes were that 
anthraquinones aretypical lymutagenic andclastogenic , 
theyarecarcinogenic to male and fema le rats and mice , 
and they arepredicted to represent likely ca rcinogeni c 
hazards tohumans exposed to these age nts,especiall y 
occupationally. Dr.J.R.Bucher, NIEHS, reported that 
the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies on 
anthraquinone were in progress.  Dr.vanZwieten, a principal rev iewer, agreed with the 
proposed conclus ions. Hethought thereshould bemore 
discussion ofthe findings from thestop-exposure group s 
ofrats. (Stop-exposure groups were evaluated at9and 
15 months as part of an attempt to gain in sight intothe 
progression orregression of chemical-induced lesions. ) 
Dr.vanZwieten noted thehigh impurity levels in thefirst 
lot of the chemicalused for the 13-we ek studies and for 
the first 2 months of the 2-year studies and said that a statement indicating that thisdidnot affect the integrit y 
ofthestudiesmigh tbehelpful. Dr.Huff responded that 
theimpurities had been chara cterized (page 20;Arneso n 
et al. , 1996). 
Dr.Ward ,thesecond principal reviewer, agree d withthe 
proposed concl usions.  He commented thatnohyalin e 
droplets were reported in the kidney of rats after 
9months, andsince 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinon e 
might  cause accumulation of " 
2:-globulin, the report 
should indicate that droplets were searched for bu t not 
found  or found  but not reported (page 83).  Dr. Ward 
objec tedtocharacterizing cholangiofibrosis found in the 
liver of ratsin  a 13-week study as "premalignant."  He 
stated that thislesion is usually induced bylivercarcino -
gens but does  not typically  progress to bile duct neo-
plasms. Dr.M.R. Elwell ,NIEHS ,saidthisinterpretatio n 
was from the liter ature and the wording on neoplastic 
potential  would be revised to  also reflect Dr.  Ward's 
experience. Dr. Reddy, the third principal reviewer, alsoagreed with 
the proposed conclusions.   He said it would have been 
useful tocharacterize the chemical nature of thepigmen t 
thataccumulated intheliver, kidney, andother organs, as 
well as in  the fur and tail.  Dr. Huff responded that, 
logically, the pigment was either thechemical or one of 
its metabolites, but the feasibility of going  back and 
defining it better would have to be determined. Dr.Russo had ob served evidence of chronic inflamma -
tion in one of the plates and wonderedwhether the liver 
lesions were associated with hepatitis. Dr.Karol asked 
ifthere wasinflammation oftheeosinophilic foci,which 
would  suggest a hypersensitivity-type reaction. 
Dr. Elwe ll saidthere was some inflammation with the 
cholangiofibrosis, but thiswas really limited tothe focal 
lesions wherethere was fibrosis and to cystic bileducts , 
andthere was not an eosinophilic inflammation; theterm 
"eosinophilic foci" referred to afocal cellular alteratio n 
of hepatocytes. Dr. Bailey cited a statement from the use, production, 
and human  exposure sections that  "no individualized 
information waslocated regarding amounts produce d      
 
           
 
   
        
     
     
                 
    
  
       16 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
or spec ific uses of 1-amino-2,4-dibromo -
anthraquinone,"  leading him to wonder if th is chemi -
cal is currently used. Dr. Huff said this was a valid 
question for 1-amino-2,4-dibro moanthraquinone and 
the other anthraquinone derivatives.  He said pr opri-
etary  information was diffic ult to obtain, although h e 
was hopeful that a request to the American Pharma -
ceutical Association concerning anthra quinone dyes in 
over-the-counter or prescription items might yield 
some data on human exposure. There was some discussion thatprimaryexposure to these dyes would be 
from topical application or exposure. 
Dr. van Zwieten moved that the Technical Report on 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthr aquinone be accepted withth e 
revisions  discussed and the conclusions  as written for 
male  and female rats and mice, clear ev idence of 
carcinogenic activity. Dr.Reddy seconde dthe motion , 
which was accepted unanimously with eleven votes.

TOXICITY 
No inform ation on the toxicity of 1-amino-2,4-
dibromoanthraquino ne in experimental animals or in 
humans wasfound inasearch of the available literature . 
REPRODUCTIVE 
AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY 
No information onthereproductiv e and development al 
toxicity  of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in 
experimental  animals or  in humans was  found in a 
search of the available literature. 
CARCINOGENICITY 
Experimental Animals 
Chemicals belonging to theanthraquinoneclas sofdyes 
arecarcinogenic to rodents (IARC , 1987; Sendelbach , 
1989)  and consistently induce ne oplasms of the liver 
(Huff et al. , 1991).   However,  each anthraquinone 
derivativeappea rs to induce cancer i n other organs or 
tissue sites as well (Huff et al. , 1991). 
For the fiveanthraquinones evaluated and reported by 
NCI/NT P, the 2-year exposure concentrations in the 
feed varied from a low of 300 ppm (0.03%) 
for 2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinone to a high of 
20,00 0 ppm (2%) for1-amino-2,4-dibromoanth raqui -
none (Table 1). 
Humans 
No information on the  potential carcinogenicity  of 
1-amino-2,4-dibr omoanthraquinone  in humans was 
found in a search of the available literature. 
GENETIC TOXICITY 
All five anthraquinones evaluated and reported by 
NCI/N TP induced mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium  (Brown and Brown, 1976; Haworth 
et al., 1983; Dunkel et al. , 1985; Zeiger et al.,1988) . 
Each  also caused siste r chromatid exchanges and 
chromoso malaberrations in cultured Chinese hamster 
ovary cells (Anderson et al. , 1990;  Loveday et al. , 
1990;  NTP, unpublished).  S9 a ctiva tion was not 
required  for 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  to 
producethese effects. Theparent compound, anthraqui -
none,  is also mutagenic in S. typhimurium ;significa nt 
increases  in mutant colonies were observed  with strains  TA98and TA100 with and without S9 (Zeiger 
et al., 1988).  In addition, anthraquinone and 
1-aminoanthra quinone  (250 mg/kg) were reported to 
induce DNA strand breaks in liver and kidney tissue of 
male  Swiss (CD-1 ®) mice following intraperitoneal 
injection (Cesarone et al. , 1982). 
STUDY RATIONALE 
The NCI selected and evaluated se veral of the 
anthraquinone- derived  dyes fora class study to deter -
mine whether these dyes have anyinherentpo tential for 
carcinogenicity  in laboratory rodents and, if  so, in 
humans aswell. Thefirstthree studies wereconducted 
with  2-amin oanthraquinone (NCI, 1 978a) , 
1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone  (NCI, 1978 b), and 
2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinone (NCI,1978c). Afourth 
substance,  1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone (C.I. 
Disperse Blue 1) wasselected and evaluated forcarci -
nogenicity bythe NTP (NTP, 1986a) .  This Tec hnica l 
Report  addresses the fifth chemical in this class, 
1-amino-2,4-di bromoanth raquinone. In addition, the 
parent  chem ical, anthraquinone, has been selected for 
study to complete the overall effort on these dyes. 
Anthra quinone and the fivesubstit uted anthraquinone s 
(Figure1),  representative of a large group of amino-, 
alkyl-,  and nitro-, or halogen-containing anthraqui-
nones, werechosen fortoxicologic characterization and 
to establish some predictive structure-activityr elation -
ships that could be used on other dyes in this categor y 
rather than testingeach and every one. Other chemica l 
classes  that have been likewise evaluated by the 
NCI/NTP toreduce the need for"one-by- one" testin g 
include  benzidine-based dyes (Morgan et al., 1994), 
phthalates (Kluwe et al., 1982 ; Huff and Kluwe, 1984 ; 
Kluwe et al. , 1985), benzene  and metabolites (Huff, 
1992),  dioxins (Huff, 1992), a nilines (Weisburger 
et al., 1984; Lamb et al. , 1986), naturally  occurring 
"gums" (Melnick et al. , 1983), chlorinated paraffi ns 
(Bucher et al. , 1987),  1,3-butadiene and derivatives 
(Melnick and Huff, 1992), pesticides (Yang et al., 
1989;  Huff and Has eman, 1991) , and penicillins and 
tetracyclines(Dunnick et al., 1989; Dietz et al., 1991). 
The bases for selection of anthraquin ones (and other 
chemical  classes as well) centered mai nly on four 
criteria:  1) lack of available or adequate data on 
carcinogenicity,  2) ma gnitude of producti on and use

patterns,  3) awareness of potential and actual human 
exposure, and 4) representation of asbroad a spec-tru m 
ofstructur al diversity within this class as po ssible. 1-
Amino-2,4-di bromoanthraq uinone wasselected from a 
group of36 environmental lysignificant aryl bromides . 
Because every other anthraquinone derivative tested so 
far for  carcinogenic activity had been shown to  be 
carcinogenic  in rodents, 1-amin o-2,4- -
dibromoanthraquinone  was al so e xpected to be 
carcinogenic  in laboratory a nimals.  Thus, the 
experimental  design,  while being consistent with  a 
"core protocol" (Huff et al. , 1988), contains several modifications suchas "stop-exposure" groups to 
better  characterize this chemical.  Additionally, 
chemical disposition studies were accomplished prior to 
the 2-year  exposures to  permit optimal selection of 
exposure  concentrations forthis water-insol uble dye. 
Because  these chemicals may and often  do contain 
considerable quantities oftheparent chemical and other 
anthraqu inone  derivatives, an extensive chemical 
analysis  was undertaken  on these five chemicals to 
quantitate  their purity  and t o identify the major 
impurities  of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
(Arneson et al. , 1996).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
 
PROCUREMENT 
AND CHARACTERIZATION OF 
1-A MINO -2,4- DIBROMOANTHRAQUINONE 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoa nthraquinone was 
obtained  from A merican Color and Chemical 
Corpor ation (Charlotte, NC; lot 1076-C) and 
Mobay  Corpor ation (Pittsburgh, PA).  The 
secon d lot  was procured from Moba y 
Corporation since A merican Color and Chemical 
Corpora tion  had stopped production . 
Lot 1076-C was used  in the 13-week studies and 
for 2 months of the 2-year studies.  The lot  from 
Mobay  Corporation was assigned lot number 
M06 1583  and was used throughout the 
remainder  of the 2-year studies.  Identity, purity, 
and stabil ity analyses were conducted by the 
analytical  chemistry labora tory, Midwes t 
Research  Institute (Kansas City, MO ) 
(Appendix  I).  Reports on  analyses performed  in 
suppo rt of the 1-ami no ­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  studies are on file at 
the Nat ional Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences (NIEHS). 
The two lots of the chemical,  a reddish brown to 
orange  powder, were identif ied as 1-amino­
2,4-dibr omoanthraquinone  by  infrared , 
ultraviol et/visible,  and nuclear magneti c 
resonance  spec trosco py.  The purity of each lot 
was determined by elemental analyses, Karl 
Fischer  water analysis, thin -laye r 
chromatography,  and high-performance liquid 
chromatography.  For lot 1076-C, elemental analyses for carbon, 
hydrogen,  nitrogen, and bromine  were in general 
agreement  with theoretical values for 1-amino­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone.   Karl Fischer water 
analysis indicated approximately 0.21% water. 
Thin-layer  and high-performance liqui d 
chromatography  indicated a major peak and 
eight  impurities.  Five  of the impurities  had peak 
areas  of less than 0.3% .  The three major 
impurities  were identified as anthraquinone, 
1-amino-2-bromoanthraquinone, and 2-amino­
1,3- dibromo anthraquinone.  By high ­
performance  liquid chrom atog raphy , 
anthraquinone  was found to be present at a 
concentration  of approximately  5.0%. 1-Amino­
2-bromoanthraquinone  and 2-amino-1,3 ­
dibromoanthraquinone  were  found to be  present 
at concentrations  of approximately  4.3% and 2.2%,  respectively.  The overall purity of 
lot 1076-C was de termined to be approximately 
87%. For lot M061583, elemental ana lyses for carbon, 
hydrogen,  nitrogen, and bromine were in  general 
agreement  with theoretical v alues for 1-amino­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone.   Karl Fis cher water 
analysis  indicated approximately 0.32% water. 
Thin-layer  and high-performance l iquid 
chromatography  indicated a major peak and si x 
impurities  with  the same  retention times as found 
for lot 1076-C.  A  total  impurity area of 3% of the 
total  chromatographic peak  area was found.  The 
overall  purity of lo t M061 583 was determined to 
be approximately 97%. Stabilit y studies performed usin g high­
perform ance liquid chromatography indicated 
that 1-amino-2 ,4-dibromoanthraquinone, when 
stored  protected fr om light, was stable as a bulk 
chemical  for at least 2 weeks at te mperat ures up 
to 60
" C. To ensure stability,  the bulk chemical was 
stored  in the dark at 4" ± 3" C throughout the 
studies.   During the 2-year studies,  the stability of  the 
bulk chemica l was monitored periodically by the 
study  laboratory using high-performance liquid 
chromato graphy;  no degradation of 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  was observed  throughout 
the studies. 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
OF DOSE FORMULATIONS 
The dose formulations were prepared weekly by 
mixing 1-amino-2,4-dibromoa nthraquinone with 
feed (Tab le I1). Homogeneity and at least 2­
week stability at 25B C were confirm ed by the 
analytical chemist ry labora tory usin g 
spectropho tometry and high-performance liqui d 
chromatography, respectively. Du ring the 
13-wee k and 2-year feed studies, the dose 
formulations were stored in the dark for no 
longer than 2 weeks. 
The study laboratory conducted periodic 
analyses of the 1-amin o ­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone dose formula tions 
using a spectrophotom etric method. For the 
13-week feed studies, dose formulations were    
 
      22 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
analyzed  at the beginning, midpoint, and en d of the 
studies (Table  I2).  During the 2-year feed studies, the 
dose formulations were analyzed every 6 to 10 weeks 
(Table  I3).  All dose formulations for r ats and mice 
were within 10% of the target concentrations during the 
13-week  and 2-year studies.  Results of  periodic  referee 
analyses  perfor med by the analytical chemistry 
laborato ry indicated good agreement with the results 
obtained by the study laboratory (Table I4). 
13-W EEK STUDIES 
The 13-week studies were cond ucted to evaluate the 
cumulative  toxic effects of repeated exposure to 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquino ne and to determine 
the appropriate exposure concentrations to be us ed in 
the 2-year studies. 
Male  and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were 
obtained  from Charles River Breeding Laborato ries 
(Portage,  MI).  Upon  receipt, the animals were 5 weeks 
old.  The rats and mice were quar antined  for 15 days 
before the studies began.  Groups of  10 male and 10 female rats and  10 male and 
10 female mice received  0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 
25,000, or 50,000 ppm 1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  in feed for 13 weeks.  Males 
and females  were housed five per  cage; water and feed 
were available ad libitum , and feed consumption was 
measured  wee kly.  Clinical findings were recorded 
twice  daily.  Animals were weighed  at study initiation, 
weekly,  and at the end of the studies.  Further details  of 
study  design and animal mai ntenance are summarized 
in Table 2.  
A necropsy was p erformed on all animals.  The brain, 
heart,  right kidney, liver, lungs, right  testis,  and thymus 
of all animals were weighed.  Tissues for microsco pic 
examination  were fixed and preserved in 10% neutral 
buffe red formalin, processed and trimmed, embedded in 
paraffin,  sectioned t o a thickness of 4 to 6 �m, and 
stained  with hematoxylin an d eosi n.  A complete 
histopathologic  examination was performed on all 
animals  that died  prior to  the end of the studies, control 
animals,  and animals administ ered 50,000 ppm. 
Table 2 lists the tissues and organs examined. 2-Y EAR STUDIES 
Study Design 
Groups  of 70  male and 70 female rats  received 0, 5,000, 
or 10,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in 
feed, and a gr oup of 50 male and 50 female rats 
received  2,000 ppm 1 -amino-2,4-dibromoant hraquinone 
in feed for 104 weeks.  Te n male an d 10 female rats 
from the 0, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm groups were 
designated  for an interim evaluation af ter 9 months. 
Ten male  and 10 female rats from  the 0 and 10,000 ppm 
groups were designated  for an interim evaluation  after 
15 months.  Groups of 60 m ale and 60 female mice 
received  0, 10,0 00, or 20,000 ppm 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  in feed for 104  weeks.  Ten 
male and 10  female mice per  group were evaluated after 
15 months. 
Stop-Exposure Evaluation 
Groups  of 40 male and 40 female rats received 
20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in fe ed 
for 9 months, when 10 males a nd 10 females were 
evaluated.  At 9 months, the dosed feed was replaced 
with a control d iet for 1 0 male and 10 female rats, 
which  were then necropsied and evaluated at 
15 months.   Twenty male and 20  female rats continued 
to receive 20,000 ppm 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  in feed and were also 
evaluated at 15 months.  
Source and Specification of Animals 
Male  and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were 
obtained  from Frederick Cancer Research Facility 
(Frederick,  MD).   Rats  were quarantined 12 to 14 days 
(males)  or 9 days (females) and mice were quarantined 
12 days (males) or 15 da ys (females) before the 
beginning  of the studies.  Five male and five  female rats 
and mice were s elect ed and evaluated for evidence of 
parasites  and gross observation of disease.  Sero logy 
samples  were collected for viral screening.  Rat s and 
mice were approximately 6 weeks old at  the beginning 
of the 2-y ear studies.  The health of the animals was 
monitored  during the studies according to the protocols 
of the NTP Sentinel Animal Program (Appendix L). 
Animal Maintenance 
Males  and females were housed five per cage.  Feed and 
water  were available ad libitum . Feed consu mption 
was measured  monthly  (Appendix J).  Cages and     
 
                   23 Materials and Methods 
racks  were rotated every 2 week s during the studies. 
Further  details of  anima l maintenance are given in 
Table  2.  Information on feed composition and 
contaminants is provided in Appendix K. 
Clinical Examinations and Pathology 
All anima ls were observed twice daily.  Clinical 
findings  were recorded weekly for 14 wee ks then 
monthly  until the end of the studies .  Anima ls were 
weighed  at study initiation, weekly for 14 weeks, and 
monthly thereafter. 
Animals  were killed with CO2, and a complete 
necropsy  was performed on all an imals.  The 
right kidney and liver of rats  and mice were weighed at 
the interim evaluations (Appendix H).   At necropsy,  all 
organs  and tissues were examined  for gross lesions, and 
all major tissues were fix ed and preserved in 10% 
neutral  buffered formalin, process ed and trimmed, 
embedded  in paraffin, sectioned, and stain ed with 
hematoxylin  and eosin for microscopic examination. 
Histopathologic  examinations were performed on all 
tissues with grossly visible lesions.  For all pa ired 
organs  (i.e., adrenal gland, kidney, ovary) , sam ples 
from each organ were examined.  Tissues examined  are 
listed in Table 2. Microscopi c evaluations were completed by the study 
laboratory  pathologist, and the pathology data were 
entered  into the Toxicology  Data  Management System. 
The microscope  slides, paraffin blocks, and  residual wet 
tissues  were sent to the NTP Archives for inventory, 
slide/block  match, and wet-tissue audit.  The s lides , 
individual  animal data records, and pathology tables 
were evaluated by  an independent pathology quality 
assess ment laboratory.  The individual animal records 
and tables were compared for accuracy, the slide and 
tissue  counts  were verified, and the histotechnique was 
evaluated  by the quality assessment laboratory.  The 
quality  assessmen t pathologi st microscopicall y 
reviewed selected neoplasms or nonneoplastic  lesions. 
The quality assessment report and slides were  submitted 
to the NTP Pathology Working Group (PWG) chair, 
who reviewed the selected  slides and  any other tissues 
for which a disagreement in diagnos is between the 
laboratory  and quality assessment pathologists  existed. 
Representative  histopathology slides containing 
examples  of lesions  related  to chemical administration, 
examples  of disagreements in diagnoses b etween the 
laboratory  and quality assessment pathologists,  or lesions  of general int erest w ere presented by the chair 
to the PWG for review.  Tissues examined included the 
adrenal  cortex (female rats), ear (rats),  kidn ey (rats), 
large  intestine (rats), liver, lung (mice) , skin (rats), 
forestomach,  thyroi d gland (rats), and urinary bladder 
(rats). The PWG consisted of the quality assessment 
pathologist  and other pathologists experience d in rodent 
toxicologic  pathology.  This group examined the tissues 
without any knowledge of exposure groups or 
previously  rendered diagnoses.  When the PWG 
consensus  differed from the opinio n of the laboratory 
pathologist,  the diagnosis  was changed.  Thus, the  final 
diagnoses  repres ent a consensus of contractor 
patholog ists and the PWG.  Details of these review 
procedures  have been descr ibed by Maronpot and 
Boorman  (1982) and Boorman et al . (1985). For 
subsequent  analysis of pathology data, the diagnosed 
lesions  for each  tissue type were evaluated separately or 
combined  according to the guidelines of McConnell 
et al.  (1986). 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
Survival Analyses 
The probability of survival was estimated by the 
product- limit procedure of Kaplan and Meier (1958) 
and is presented in the form  of graphs.  Animals  found 
dead of othe r than natural causes or missexed animals 
were censored from the survival analyses; animals 
dying  from na tural causes were not censored. 
Statistical  analyses for  possible dose-related effects  on 
survival  used Cox's (1972) met hod fo r testing two 
groups  for equality  and Tarone's (1975) life table test to 
identify  dose-related trends.  A ll reported P values for 
the survival analyses are two sided. 
Calculation of Incidence 
The incidences of neopla sms or nonneoplastic lesions 
as presented in  Tables A1, A5, B1, B5, C1, C5, D1, D5, 
E1, E3, F1, and F3 are given as the number of animals 
bearing  such  lesions at a  specific anatomic site and the 
number  of anim als with that site examined 
microscopical ly.  For calculation of statistical 
significance,  the incidences of most  neoplasms (Tables 
A3, B3, C3, D3, E2a, E2b, F2a, and F2 b) and o f all 
nonneoplastic  lesions are given as the n umbers of 
animals  affected at each site examined microscopically. 
However,  when macroscopic  examination  was required 
to detect neoplasms in cer tain tissues (e.g., harderian 
gland,  intestine, mammary gland, and skin) before 
microscopic evaluation or when neoplasms   
 
 
 24 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
had multiple potential  sites of occurrence (e.g., 
leukemia or lymphoma), the denominators consist of 
the number of animals on which a necrops y was 
performed.   Tables  A3, B3, C3,  D3, E2a, E2b, F2a, and 
F2b also give  the survival-adjusted neoplasm rate for 
each group and each site-specific neoplasm, i.e., the 
Kaplan-Meier estimate  of the  neoplasm incidence that 
would  have  been observed at the end of the study  in the 
absence  of mortality from all other competing risks 
(Kaplan and Meier, 1958). 
Analysis of Neoplasm Incidence 
The majority of neoplasms in these stud ies were 
considered  to be  incidental to the cause of death  or not 
rapidly  lethal.  Thus, the primary statistical method 
used was logistic regression analysis, which assumed 
that the diagnosed ne oplasms were discovered as the 
result  of death from an unrelated cause  and thus did  not 
affect  the risk of death.  In this approach, neoplasm 
prevalence  was modeled as a logistic function of 
chemical  exposure and time.   Both  linear and quadratic 
terms in time were incorporated initially, a nd th e 
quadratic  term was eli minated  if the fit of the model 
was not significantly enhanced.  The neoplasm 
incidences  of exposed and cont rol groups were 
compared  on the basis of the likelihood sc ore test for 
the regression coefficient of dose. This method of 
adjusting  for intercurrent mortality is the prev alence 
analysis  of Dinse and Lagakos  (1983), further described 
and illustrated by Dinse and Haseman (1986).  When 
neoplasms  are inciden tal, this comparison of the 
time-specific  neoplasm prevalences also provides a 
comparison  of the time-specific neoplasm incidences 
(McKnight and Crowley, 1984). 
In addition to logis tic regression, other methods of 
statistical  analys is were used, and the results of these 
tests are summarized in the appendixes. These methods 
include  the life tabl e test (Cox, 1972; Tarone, 1975), 
appropriate  for rapidly lethal neoplasms, and the Fisher 
exact  test and the  Cochran-Armitage trend test (Armi-
tage, 1971; Gart et al., 1979), procedures based  on the 
overall proportion of lesion-bearing animals. 
Tests  of significance included pairwise comparisons of 
each dosed group with controls and a test for an overall 
dose-related  trend.  Co ntinuity-corrected tests were 
used in the analysis of neoplasm incidence, and 
reported  P values are one sided.  The p rocedures 
described  in the preceding paragraphs were a lso used to evaluate  selected nonneoplastic lesions.  For further 
discussion of these statistical methods, refer to Haseman 
(1984). 
Analysis of Nonneoplastic Lesion Incidences 
Because  all nonneoplastic lesions in this study were 
considered to be incidental  to the cause of  death or not 
rapidly  lethal, the primary statistical analysis used was 
a logistic regression analysis in which nonneoplastic 
lesion  prevalence was modeled  as a logistic function of 
chemical  exposure  and time.  For lesions detected at  the 
interim  evaluation, th e Fis her exact test, a procedure 
based  on the overall  proportion of affected animals,  was 
used. 
Analysis of Continuous Variables 
Organ  and body weight data, which have  approximately 
normal distributions, were analyzed using t he 
parametric  multiple comparison  procedures of Dunnett 
(1955)  and Willia ms (19 71, 1972).  Jonckheere's test 
(Jonckheere, 1954) was used to assess the significance 
of the dose-r elated trends and to determine whether a 
trend-sensitive  test (Will iams' test) was more 
appropriate  for pairw ise co mparisons than a test that 
does not assume a monotonic dose-related trend 
(Dunnett's  test).  Prior to analysis, extreme values 
identified  by the outlier test of Dixon and Ma ssey 
(1951)  were examined by NTP per sonne l, and 
implausible  values were eliminated from t he analysis. 
Average  severity  values were analyzed for  significance 
using  the Mann-Whitney U test (Hollander and  Wolfe, 
1973). 
Historical Control Data 
Although  the concurren t control group is always the 
first and most appropriate control group used for 
evaluation, historical  control data can be helpful  in the 
overall  assessme nt of lesion incidence in certain 
instances.  Consequently, neoplasm incidences  from the 
NTP historical control  database (Haseman et al., 1984, 
1985)  are inc luded in the NTP reports for neoplasms 
appearing to show compound-related effects. 
QUALITY ASSURANCE METHODS 
The 13-week and 2-year studies were conducted in 
compliance with Food and Drug  Administration Good 
Laboratory  Practice  Regulations  (21 CFR, Part 58).  In

studies were audited retro spectively by an 
independent quality assurance contractor. 
Separate audits covering completeness and 
accuracy of the pathology data, pathology 
specimens, final pathology tables, and a draft of 
this NTP Technical Repo rt were conducted. 
Audit procedures and findings are presented in 
the reports and are on file at NIEHS. The audit 
findin gs were reviewed and assessed by NTP 
staff, so all discrepancies had been resolved or 
were otherwise addressed during the preparation 
of this Technical Report. 
GENETIC TOXICOLOGY 
The genetic t oxicity of 1-amino ­
2,4-dibromoanthra quinone was assessed by 
testing the ability of the chemical to induce 
mutations in various strains of Salmonella 
typhimurium cells and sister chromati d 
exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in 
cultu red Chinese hamster ovary cells. The 
prot ocols for these studies and the results are 
given in Appendix G. 
The genetic toxicity studies of 1-amino­
2,4-dibromoa nthraquinone are part of a larger 
effort by the NTP to develop a database that 
would permit the evalua tion of carcinogenicity 
in experimental animals from the structure and 
responses of the chemical in short-term in vitro 
and in vivo genetic toxicity tests. These genetic toxicity tests were originally developed to 
study mechanisms of chemical ly induced DNA 
damage and to predict carcinogenicity in 
animals, based on the electrophilic theory of 
chemical carcinogenesis and the somatic 
mutation theory (Miller and Miller, 1977; 
Straus, 1981; Crawford, 1985). 
There is a s trong correlation between a 
chemical's pote ntial electrophilicity (structural 
alert to DNA reactivity), mutagen icity in 
Salmonella, andcarcinogenicity inrodents. The 
combination of electrophilicity and Salmonella 
mutagenicity is highly correlated with the 
induction of carcinogenicity in rats and mice 
and/or at mult iple tissue sites (Ashby and 
Tennant, 1991). Other in vitro genetic toxicity 
tests do not correlat e well with rodent 
carcinogenicity (Tennant et al., 1987; Zeiger 
et al., 1990), although these other tests can 
provide information on the types of DNA and 
chromosome effects that can be induced by the 
chemical being investigated. Data from NTP 
studies show that a positive response in 
Salmonella is currently the most predictive in 
vitro test for rodent carcinogenicity (89% of the
Salmonella mutagens were rodent carcinogens), 
and that there is no complementarity among the
in vitro genetic toxicity tests. That is, no battery 
of tests that included the Salmonella test 
improved the predictivity of the Salmonella test 
alone.  26 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

RESULTS
 
RATS 
13-W EEK STUDY 
One male (week 13) and one female (week 8) in the 
50,000 ppm groups died during the study (Table 3). 
The deaths of one 5,000 ppm male (week 4) and two 
addition al 50,000 ppm males (week 13) were not 
chemical related. The final mean body weights and 
body weight gains of all exposed rat groups were 
significantly lower thanthose ofthecontrols. Feed 
consum ption  by all exposed groups was less than th at 
TABLE 3 by the controls throughout the study and generally 
decreased with increasing exposure concentration 
(Tab le 3).  The greatest differences in feed co nsump -
tion from that by the controls occurr ed in the 25,00 0

weight  to males and 170, 340, 660, 1, 500, and 
3,200  mg/kg to females.  Pink-red  staining of the fur and 
tail was observ ed in all  exposed groups of rats.  The 
bedding of all expose d groups except the 2,500 ppm 
groups  was stained pink-red from day  2 of the study. 
Lethargy  and ema ciation were noted in all 50,000 ppm 
males.  Female rats in  the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups 
were lethargic and staggered, and 50,000 ppm  females 
exhibited hunched posture. 
The relative liver weights of exposed groups of males 
and the absolute and relative liver weights of exposed 
groups of females were significantly great er thanthose 
of the controls (Table H1). The absolute and relative 
thymus weights of exposed males and females were 
significantly lower than those of controls. The lower 
absolute brain, heart, kidney, lung, and testis weights 
of exposed male and female ratswere probably related 
to the lower final mean body weights of these groups. 
Observations at necropsyincludedred or pink staining 
of the gastroi ntestinal tract contents and/or mucosa, 
kidneys, and urine. In addition, regional lymph nodes 
and livers were dark in color, and capsular surfaces of 
thelivers were granular inappearance. These findings 
were most common in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm 
groups. Chemical-related lesions were pre sent in the liver, 
kidney, and spleen of male and female rats. In the 
liver, a spectrum of nonneoplastic degenerative and 
proliferative lesions occurred inmales and females in 
the 25 ,000 and 50,000 ppm groups (Table 4). 
Hepatocellular cytomegaly (hypertrophy) waspresent 
in all rats in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups and in 
most females in the 10,000 ppm group. This lesion 
consisted of enlarged hepatocytes with eosinophilic 
cytoplasm andmarked variation innuclear size. In the 
centrilobular areas of a few rats from exposed groups, 
there was a minimal to mild cytoplasmic vacuolation 
(vacuolar degen eration). The incidence of vacuolar 
degeneration was not dose-related, but at the higher 
exposure concent rations, minimal hepatocellular 
necrosis was somet imes associated with vacuolar 
change. Focal hepatocellu lar alterations including 
basophilic, eosinophilic, or clear cell foci were also 
present in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups. In the 
periportal region of the hepatic lobules, there was an 
increased number of inflammatory cells around the 
bile ducts. Bile duct hyperplasia consisted of proliferation of ovalcells inthe periportal 
area as well as proliferation of larger bile ducts lined 
by hyperchromatic, pleomorphic biliary epithelium. 
Focal necrosis of biliary epithelium and acute inflam-
mation (necrotizing cholangitis) in some hyperplastic 
bile ducts were associated with periportal fibrosi s. 
Thespectrum ofproliferative bileductlesions (hyper-
plasia, necrotizing cholangitis, and fibrosis) was 
morphologicall y consistent with the lesion described 
as cholangiofibrosis. A brown pigment was present in 
the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. The pigment was 
negative foriron, PAS, bile, andacid-fast staining; did 
not polarize light or fluoresce; and was considered to 
represent 1-amino-2,4-d ibromo anthraquinone and/or its 
metabolites. Inthe kidney ofexposed groups ofmales andfemales, 
there were chemi cal-related increases in the inci-
dences of a brown, granular pigment in the tubule 
epithelium (Table 4). This brown pigment had the 
same staining features asthe pigment thatwaspresent 
in the liver. In both males and females, there were 
renal tubule cells with enlarged nuclei. Inmales, there 
wasa hyaline droplet nephropathy characterized by an 
increase in eosinophilic protein droplets (hyaline 
droplet accumulation) in the cytoplasm of the renal 
tubule epithelium as well as in the lumen of the 
tubules. There was no evidence of increased severity 
of tubule regeneration in males or females. 
Chemical-related effects in the spleen of all exposed 
groups of males and females consisted of a slight 
increase in the amount of hematopoiesis relative to 
that normally present in controls. 
Other nonspecific changes included lymphoid deple-
tion in the thymus and decreased uterus size. These 
findings were at tributed to the markedly lower body 
weight gain in rats from the higher exposure groups. 
Dose Selection Rationale: Based on chemical disposi-
tion studies, mean body weights, andchemical-related 
lesions of the liver, kidney, andspleen present mainly 
in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups, exposure con-
centration s selected for the 2-year feed study of 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in rats were 0, 
2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm. Much of the differ-
ences in mean body weights recorded for the 13-week 
studies were more likely due to decreased feed pala-
tability than to any overt toxicity. None theless, if

Survival 
Estimates of 2-year survival probabilities formale and 
female  rats are shown in Table 5 an d in the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves inFigure 2. Survival of 
male  and female rats in the 10,000  ppm  groups was 
significantly lower than that of the controls. 
Body Weights, Feed and Compound 
Consumption, and Clinical Findings 
Mean  body weights of exposed male and female rats 
were lower than  those of the controls after week  2 
(Tables 6and7,Figure 3). Final meanbody weight sof 
exposed males were 14% to 30%  lower than that of the controls; final  mean body  weights of exposed 
females  were 20% to 46% lower than that of the 
controls.   Feed  consumption by exposed males  and 
female s was similar among exposed groups and was 
slightly lower than that by the controls (Ta blesJ3 and 
J4).  Dietary levels o f2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm 
delivered  average daily doses  of approximately 90, 
240, and 490 mg  1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraqui-
none/kg body weight to males and 110, 285, and 600 
mg/k g to females.  Discoloration of the fur andurine 
wasevident in all exposed groups as early as day 8 and 
was observed throughout the study.  Emaciation 
occur red in a dose-related manner in male and female 
rats and occurred  in over 50% of the rats exposed  to 
10,000 ppm.

Pathology and Statistical Evaluation 
This section  describes the statistically  significant or 
biologica lly noteworthy changes in the incide nces of 
mononuclear  cell leukemia; neoplasms of  the liver, 
large  intestine, kidney, urinary bladder, and other 
organs; and nonneoplastic lesions of the liver, k idney , 
urinary bladder, forestoma ch, and seminal vesicles of 
rats.  Summaries of the incidences  of neoplasms and 
nonneoplastic  lesions, individual animal tumor 
diagnoses,  statistical analy ses of primary neoplasms 
that occurred with an incidence of at least5% inatleast 
one expos uregroup, and histor ical incidences for the 
neoplasms  mentioned in this section are pre sented in 
Appendix  A formale ratsand Appendix B for female 
rats. 
Liver: At the 9-month interim evalu ation,the absolut e 
and relative liver weights of exposed groups of males 
and females were significantl y greater than those of the 
controls (Tabl eH2). Onehepatocellular adenoma was 
observed  in a 5,000 ppm male at 9 months (Tables 8 
andA1). Incidences offociofhepatocellular alteratio n 
were increased in males in the 10,000 ppm group, an d 
a minimal accumulati onof pigment inhepatocytes was 
present in  males and females from the 10,000 ppm 
groups  and in females fr om th e 5,000 ppm group 
(Tables  8, A5, and B5).  At  the 15 -month interim 
evaluation,  the absolute and relative liver weights of 
exposed groups  of females were significantly greate r 
than those of the controls (Table H3).   Incidences of 
single  and multiple hep atocellular adenomas and 
carcinom aswere increased at15 months in10,000 ppm 
males andfemales(Tables 8,A1,andB1). Incidence s 
of foci of hepatocellular alteration and accumula tion of 
pigment in hepatocytes were alsoincreased in expose d 
groups of males and females (Tables 8, A5, and B5). 
Attheend of the 2-year study, the incidences ofhepato -
cellular  adenoma, hepatocellular c arcinoma, and 
hepatocellular adenoma or carci noma (combined) were 
significan tly increased in all exposed group s of males 
and females (Tables 8, A3, and B3).  The incidences of mult iple hepatocellular adenomas 
and multiple hepatocellular carcinomas inexposed male 
and female groups were great er than those of the 
controls  (Tables 8, A1, and B1).  Inc idences of 
hepatocellular adenoma orcarcinoma (combined) inall 
exposed groups ofmales and females exceeded theNTP 
histori cal range s(males: 0%-10%; females: 0%-6% ) 
forfeedstudy control s (Tables 8, A4 a,andB4a). The 
majori ty of the benign and mal ignant liver neoplasm s 
consisted ofwell-differentiated neoplastic hepato cytes 
with cellular atypia and increased numbers o f mitoses . 
Carcinomas had trabecular,glandular, orsolid growth 
patterns (Plate 1) with areas ofnecrosis, cavitation,an d 
fibrosis. Metastases were common in the lungs 
(Plates 2 and 3), butmetastatic fociwere also present in 
the stoma ch,pancreas, adrenal gland, lymph node, an d 
spleen. 
The incidences of single and multiple hepatocholan gio-
carcinoma were significantly increased in 5,000 ppm 
males and females and in 10,000 ppm females (Table s 
8, A3, and B3).  These neop lasms co nsisted of a 
mixture  of mal ignant hepatocytes and well-
differentiated  cuboidal  epithelium forming  distinct 
ductul ar structures (Pl ate4). Both hepatocellular and 
biliary  components of this  neoplasm were present in 
metastatic  foci.  In addition, s everal other benign 
(cholangioma and hepatocholangiom a)and malig nant 
(chola ngiocarcinoma) liverneoplasms occur red only in 
exposed  groups of males and  females  (Tables 8, A1, 
and B1).  
During the2-year study, the incidences of pigmentatio n 
and foci of hepatocellular alteration (clear cell, 
basophilic, and eosinophilic ) were increase d inexpose d 
groups  of males and females (Tables 8, A5, and B5). 
Cells insome focihad intensely eosinophilic cytoplas m 
and hepatocellula r atypia similar to the appearan ce of 
cellsinthehepatocellul ar neoplasms. Thepigment was 
considered to be1-amino-2, 4-dib romoanthraquinone or 
a metabolite based on the results of the histochemi cal 
procedures performed during the13-week study and the 
15-month interim evaluation.  40 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

colon  was significan tly increased in 10,000 ppm males, 
and the incidences of rectal  carcinoma were  significantly 
increased  in 5,000 and 10,000 ppm males and females 
(Tables  9, A3, and B3).  The intes tinal neoplasms that 
occurred  in the distal  colon and rectum of rats were 
morphologically similar. 
Adenomatous  polyps ( adenomas) consi sted o f 
pedunculated,  exophytic masses  (Plate 5)  of well-differen-
tiated, columnar epithelium with prominent, hyper-
chromatic  nuclei. Carcinoma (adenocarcin oma) was 
generally  similar to adenoma, except that invasion of the 
stromal  stalk of the neoplasm and extension into  the 
submucosa,  and occasionally into  the muscular  wall, were 
evident  microscopically.  In the ma ligna nt neoplasms, 
irregula r gland ular structures or cords of atypical epithelial 
cells  were present in the submucosa (Plate 6) and were 
frequently  associated  with a scirrhous response.  In males, 
metastatic colon  carcinoma was  observed in the lung and 
mesenteric lymph nodes,  and metastatic rectal  carcinoma 
was observed in the lumbar lymph nodes an d pancreas 
(Table A1).  Incidences of carcinoma (colon and rectum 
combined)  in exposed groups of males and females 
exceeded  the  NTP historical ranges (males: 0%-2%; 
females: 0%) for feed study controls (Tables  9, A4b, and 
B4b). 
Kidney:  At the 9-month interim evaluation, the relative 
kidney  weights of exposed groups of males and f emale s 
were  significantly  greater than  those of the controls (Table 
H2).   Pigmentation  and hyaline droplet  accumulation were 
present  in the  kidneys of all  exposed males (Tables 10 and 
A5).   The sizes of some renal tu bule  nuclei were mini-
mally  increased in males a nd females from all exposure 
groups,  and the severity of the nephropathy (tubule 
epithelial  regeneration, mononuclear inflammatio n, and 
renal  tubule dilation  with protein casts) was slightly more 
severe  than that observed in the controls (T able  10).  At 
the 15-month interim evaluation, th e relative kidney 
weights of 10,000 ppm males and femal es were  signifi-
cantly greater than  those of the controls (Table H3). The 
severity  of nephropathy was increased in 10,000 ppm 
males  and females compared to controls (Table  10).  This 
was characterized by an increase in the foci of tubule 
epithelial  regeneration; nuclear enl argement in some 
tubule  epithelium, similar to that in the 13-week studies 
and at the 9-month interim evaluati on, was also present. 
At 15 months in the 10,000 ppm  groups, pigmentation  of 
renal  tubule epithelium was  present  in all rats; renal tubule 
epithelial hyperplasia was  observed in  two males and three females; and adenomas were observed in two 
males (Tables 10, A1, A5, and B5). At 2 years, there was  a significant dose-related increase in 
the incidences of  renal  tubule adenoma in exposed groups 
of males and females (Tables 10, A3, and B3) .  Multiple 
adenomas were ob served in all exposed groups of males 
and in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm females.  Adenomas 
were  expansile lesions involving one or m ore adjacent 
tubules  and were generally five or more  times  the diameter 
of the normal renal tubule.  The cells  within  the adenomas 
were  generally similar in morphology to those in  the focal 
hyperplastic  lesions.  Carcinomas were larger than ad e-
nomas  and frequently had more cellular atypia, necrosis, 
and local invasion.  One  carci noma in a male rat metas-
tasized  to the lung, and one in a female rat  metastasized to 
the adrenal gland.  Renal tubule carcinomas occurr ed in 
two 5,000 ppm males, one  10,000 ppm male, and two 
10,000  ppm females.  The combined incidenc es of renal 
tubule  adenoma or carcinoma were significantly increased 
in exposed males and fem ales and exceeded the NTP 
historical  ranges ( males :  0%-6%; females: 0%-2%) for 
feed study controls (Tables 10, A4c, and B4c). 
Incidences  of r enal tubule hyperplasia were significantly 
increased  in exposed ma les and females (Tables 10, A5, 
and B5).  Hyperplasia c onsisted of a tubule lined by two 
or more layers of renal tubule epithelium;  these  were most 
often  located in the cortex or outer stripe of  the oute r 
medulla.   Foci of hyperplasia were  distinguished from  the 
more  basophilic  foci of tubule epithelial regeneration 
typically  associated with nephropathy.  There was no clear 
dose-re lated  increase in the incidence or severity of 
nephropathy  in rats at  2 years (Table 10).  The  incidences 
and severity of transitional cell hyperplasia in the renal 
pelvis  were increased in exposed groups of  males and 
females  (Tables 10, A5,  and B5); there were no increases 
in the incidences of transitional cell papilloma or carci -
noma  of the renal pelvi s (Tables 10, A1, and B1).  The 
incidence  of a reddish brown pigment within the renal 
tubule  epithelium and lumina of exposed rats was in-
creased  at the 9-  and 15-month interim evaluations and at 
2 years.  The pigment was c haract erized in the 13-week 
study  and at the 15-month interim  evaluation as PAS-
negative;  resistant to digestion by diastase; isotropic;  and 
negative for melanin, hemosiderin,  hematoidin, bile, 
lipofuscin, or ceroid staining methods.  The pigment  was 
presumed  to be 1-a mino-2,4-dibromo anthraquinone or one 
of its metabolites.

Urinary  Bladder:  Hype rplasia of the transitional cel l 
epithelium of the urinary bladder was observed in 
10,000 ppm females at 9 months and in 10,000 ppm 
males and females at 15 months (Tables 11, A5, and 
B5). Transitional cellhype rplasia waspresent inmost 
5,000 and 10,000 ppm females at 2 years, and the 
incidences  of this lesion were sig nificantly increase d 
in5,000and10,000 ppmmales. Hyperp lasia consiste d 
of a diffuse or focal increa se in thickness of the 
transiti onal epithelium; minimal cellula r 
pleomorphism and increased numbers of mitot ic cell s 
weresometimes present. Other nonneop lastic lesion s 
that occurred only in exposed rats include d squamou s 
metaplasia of the transitional epithelium and fatty 
metaplasia (fat proliferation) of the stroma of the 
bladder wall. Two trans itional cell carcinomas and one papillom a 
occurred in 10,000 ppm females at the 15-month 
interim evaluation. At2years, incidences oftransi-
tional cell papilloma, carcinoma, and papilloma or 
carcinoma (comb ined) were significantly increased in 
10,000 ppm males and 5,000 and 10,000 ppm fem ales 
(Tables 11, A3, and B3) and exceed ed the NTP histori -
calranges(males: 0%-2%; femal es: 0%-2%) forfeed 
study controls (Tables 11, A4d, and B4d). Transi-
tional cell papilloma consisted of a pedunculate d or 
broad-based mass of transitional epithelium with a 
central fibrovascular stroma; there was squamous 
metaplasia of the surface epithelium in some papil-
lomas. Transitional cell carcinoma wascharacterize d 
by an exophytic or endophytic growth pattern and 
invasion of the lamina propria or muscularis of the 
bladder wall (Plates 7 and 8). There was cellular 
atypia  and squamous or mucous metaplasia of transi -
tional epithelium in some carcinomas.

STOP-EXPOSURE EVALUATION 
Stop-exposure  groups of male and  female rats  were 
included  in the NTP  2-year  study to evaluate the 
potential  for progression or regression of chemical-
relate d liver, large intestine, kidney, urinary bladder, and 
forestomach lesions during arecovery period. Tenmale 
and 10 female rats were exposed to 20,000 ppm 
1-amino-2 ,4-dibromoanthraquinone infeed for9 months 
followed byadministration ofundosed feed until theend 
ofthe15-month period (9-month stop-exposure groups) . 
In addition, 30 males and 30 female swere exposed to 
20,000 ppm1-ami no-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone infeed 
for15months (15-monthexposuregroups). Tenmales 
and 10 females from the  15-month  exposure groups 
were  evaluated at the 9-month i nterim evaluation 
(9-month  interim  evaluation groups) . 
Survival 
Estimates of 2-year surv ivalprobabilities formale and 
female  rats are shown in the  Kaplan-Meier  survival 
curves in Figure 4.  All mal essurvived 9months; three 
males from the 9-month stop-exposu regroup and three 
males from the15-m onthexposure group died before the 
endofthe15-month evaluation (Table14). Allfemal es 
in the 9 -month stop-exposure group survived until the 
endofthe15-month evaluation.  One female from the 
15-month exposure group died during the first9 months ; 
an additiona lseven femalesdied between month9 and 
the end of the 15-month evaluation (Table 15). Body Weights 
and Feed and Compound Consumption 
The mean body weights of male and female rat sin the 
9-month stop-expos ureand 15-month exposure group s 
are compared with the controls from the 2-year core 
study  in Tables 14 and 15, and  the growth curves  for 
exposed rats in the 15-month exposure groups are 
shown  in Figure 5.   The mean body weights of males 
and females in the 9-monthstop-exposur e groups were 
20%  to 22%  lower than those of the  controls at the 
9-month interim evaluation of the 2-year corestudy and 
were 20% to 21% lower thanthose of the contro lsatthe 
15-month interim evaluat ion of the 2-year core study . 
The mean body  weights of males and females in  the 
15-month  exposure groups were 19%  to 21% lower 
than those of the controls at  the 9-month interim 
evaluation  of the  2-year  core study and were 25% to 
33%  lower than those of the control s at the 15-month 
interim  evaluation of the 2-year core study.  F eed 
consumption by9-month stop-expos ure and 15-mont h 
exposure malesand femal es was generally lower than 
that bythecontrols throughout thestudy (Tables J1 an d 
J2).  The dietary level of 20 ,000 ppm delivered daily 
doses  of approximately  1,300 mg 1-amino-
2,4-dibrom oanthraquinone/kg body weight to males and 
1,800 mg/kg to femal es in the 9-month stop-exposur e 
groups and daily doses of approximately 1,100 mg/k g 
to males and 1,400 mg/kg to fema lesin the 15-mont h 
exposure groups.

Pathology and Statistical Analysis of Results 
Summaries oftheincidences of neoplasms and nonneo -
plastic lesions areshown in Tables E1 and E3 formale 
rats and Tables F1 and F3 for female r ats. For 
statistic alanalyses , the incidences in the 9-month stop-
exposure groups and the15-mo nthexposure groups at 
the end of 15 months areco mpared with the 15-mont h 
interim evaluation controls of the2-yea r core study for 
male rats(Table E2a) and female rats(Table F2a). The 
incidences  in the 15-month exposure groups are 
compared with the 9-month stop-exposure groups after 
6 months of recovery  for male  rats (Table E2b) and 
fem ale rats (Table F2b) . 
Progression or Regression 
of Chemical-Induced Lesions 
Liver: Rats in the stop-exposure study exposed to 
20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone inthe 
feed for 9 or 15 months had chemical-related  effects  similar to  those  observed in rats exposed to 
concentrations  up to 10,000  ppm in the 2-year  core 
study.   The absolute and  rela tive liver weights of 
exposed males and females weres ignificantly grea ter 
than those of the contro ls at both the 9-month  interim 
and 15- month evaluations of the 15-month exposur e 
groups  (Tables H2 and H3).  With respect to both 
neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions in the liver, there 
was no evidence of regression in the incidence or 
severityofchemical -related pigmentation, focal hepat o-
cellular  alteration, or hepatoce llular adenoma or 
carcinoma  when administration of 1-amino--
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  was discontinued after 
9months. Theincidences andseverity ofliver lesions 
after  9 months of exposu re we re similar with and 
witho ut a 6-monthrecovery period. The incidences  of 
liver lesions in  the 15-month exposure groups were 
greater  than in the 9-month stop-exposur e groups but 
the severities were comparable (Tables  16, E2a, and 
F2a).

males and females.  At 15 months, renal tubu le 
adenomas  were observed in three mal es and three

Urinary  Bladder: A transitional cell papilloma was 
presen t in the urinary bladder of one exposed ma le at 
9 months (Tables 18 and E1).  When exposure  was 
discontinued  at 9 months, no chemical-related 
nonneoplastic  lesions  or neoplasms  were present at 
15months. With continuoustreatmen t,transitional cell 
hyperplasia  and neopl asms of the urinary bladder 
developed by15months. Infemales, aminimaltomild 
transitional cell hyperplasia wasobs erved at 9 month s 
and did not completely regress  with the cessation of 
exposure; a squamous cell papill oma was observed in 
one female  at 15 months (Tables 18 and F1).  In contrast, continuous expo surefor 15 months 
resulted  in an in creased incidence and severity of 
transitional  cell hyperp lasia, as well as squamous 
metaplasia  of the transitional epithelium and a fatty 
metaplasia  (fat proliferation) of the stroma of the 
bladder wall. 
Forestomach: Chemical-related lesions of the fore-
stomach were not present  in males  or females at the 
9-month interim evaluation.  H yperplasia, hyperkera -
tosis,  inflammation,  and ulceration  were present in 
approximately  20%  of exposed males, but not in the 
controls  at 15  months (Table 18).  A squamous cell 
papilloma waspresent in one male from the 15-month 
exposu regroup (Table E1). Infemale rats,forestoma ch 
lesions were notpresent inthe co ntrol or 9-month stop-
exposureg roups. Hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and/o r

One 25,000 p pm male (week 11) and one 5,000 ppm 
male (week 13) died during the study (Table 19). 
Neither death waschemicalrel ated.  One 10,00 0ppm 
female wasaccidently killed. Final mean bodyweight s 
of exposed groups of male and fema le mice were 
similar  to those of the controls.  Mean body weight 
gains  of exposed groups of males and  females were 
generally  greater than th ose of the controls.  Feed 
consumption by exposed mice was similar to 
TABLE  19 that by the  controls.  Dietary levels of  2,500, 5,000, 
10,000, 25,000, and50,000 ppmdelivered average daily 
doses of approximately 500, 1,080, 1,850, 6,200, and

Absolute and relative live r weights of 5,000, 10,000, 
25,000,  and 50,000 ppm male and female mice were 
signi ficantly  greater than those of the controls

included red staining of thegastrointestinal tract and its 
contents  in all exposed male mice ex cept those in the 
2,500  ppm group and  red staining in the kidney  and 
urine. These findings were observed lessfrequentl yin 
females than in males. Chemical-relat ed lesions were present in the liver 
(Table 20). There were increased incidences ofcentril-
obular  hypertrophy in the 10,000, 25,000, and

present in the cytoplasm o f hepatocytes of all expose d 
groups ofmales. Pigmen t was generally located inthe 
centrilobular  portion of the hepatic lobule.  Pigment 
similar  to that in male mice was present in just a few

Dose  Selection Rationale: As no 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone-related adverse effects were 
observed in feed consumptio n, mean body weights, or 
surviv al, exposure concent rations chosen forthe2-yea r 
study  were based mainly on the frequency and espe-
cially  the severity of centril obular hypertroph y of the 
liver in male mice.  Beca use only lesions of mild 
severitywere observed in the 10,000 and 25,000 ppm 
groups, and lesions ofmoderate severity were observe d 
in the 50,000 ppm group, and these were notlife-jeopardizinglesions, exposure concentration s 
selected  for th e 2- year study of 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthr aquinone in mice were0,10,000, and 
20,000 ppm. Other considerations includeconsistenc y 
among  males and females (since females could have 
been given higher exposure concen trations) and corre -
spondence to the exposure concentrations selected for 
the start-stop, progression/regression experiment s(stop -
exposure evaluation) in rats.

Pathology and Statistical Evaluation 
This section describes the statistically significant 
or biologically noteworthy changes in  the inci-
dences  of neoplasms and/or nonneoplastic lesions 
of the liver, forestomach, lung,  kidney,  uterus, and 
pitui tary gland of mice.  Summaries of the inci-
dences  of neoplasms and nonneoplastic l esions, 
individual  animal tumor diagnoses, statistical 
analyses  of primary neoplasms that occurred  with 
an incidence of at  least 5% in at least one exposure 
group,  and historical incidences for  the neoplasms 
mentioned  in this section are  presented  in Appen-
dix C for male mice and Ap pend ix D for female 
mice. 
Liver: At the 15-month interim evaluation, abso-
lute and relative liver weights of exposed groups 
of females were significantly  greater  than those of 
the controls (Table H5).  Hepatocellular adenomas 
and carcinomas  were observed in  exposed groups 
of males and females; none were present  in the 
controls  (Tables 24, C1, and D1).  At the e nd of 
the 2-year  study, the incidences  of hepatocellular 
adenoma  and hepatocell ularcarcinoma in exposed 
groups  of males and females were significantly 
increased (Tables 24, C3, and D3).  The inci-
dences  of multiple hepatocellular adenomas or 
multiple  hepatocellular carcinomas in exposed 
groups  of males and females were also increased 
(Tables  24, C1, and D1).  In cidences of 
hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (com bined) in exposed groups  of males and females exceeded 
the NTP historical ra nges for feed study controls 
(Tables  24, C4a, an d D4a ).  In addition to 
hepatocellular  adenomas and carcinomas,  a small 
numb er of hepatoblastomas occurred in exposed 
groups  of males and females (Tab les 24, C1, and 
D1).   These malignant  hep atocellular neoplasms 
contained  areas resembling hepatocellular c arci-
noma;  in addition, there were prominent  lobules or 
nodular  foci separated by vascular c hannels and 
composed  of undifferentiated cells (Plates 9 and 
10).  The neoplastic cells were elongated w ith a 
scant  amou nt of darkly staining cytoplasm and 
oval hyperchrom atic nuclei. Cellula r 
pleomor phism and mitotic figures were commonly 
present. 
At the 15-month interim  evaluation and at the  end 
of the 2-year  study, the incidences  of centrilobular 
hypertrophy  of hepatocytes in exposed groups of 
males were significantly increased, and the inci-
dences of hepatocellular pigmentation w ere signif -
icantly  increased  in exposed groups  of males and 
females  (Tables 24, C5, and D5).  This brown, 
granula r pig-ment resembled that found in the 
13-week  studi es of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthra -
quinone;  histochemical procedur es were not 
repeated  during  this 2-year study. The incidences 
of clear cell focus in exposed groups of fema le 
mice  were significantly increased at the  end of the 
2-year study.  Results	 71

Forestomach: Squamous cell papillomas were observe d 
in 20,000 ppm males and  in 10,000 and  20,000 ppm 
females at the 15-month interim evaluation (Tabl es 25, 
C1, and D1).  At the end  of the 2-year study, the  inci-
dences of squamous cellpapilloma and squamo us cell 
carcinoma in expose dgroups ofmales andfemal es were 
significantly  increased (Tables 25, C3, and  D3). The 
incidences  of multip le squamous cell papilloma in 
20,000ppm male s and fe males were also significantl y 
increased  in the 2-year study (Tables 25, C1, and D1). 
Incidences  of squamous cell papilloma or carcinoma 
(combined ) inexposed groups ofmales andfemaleswere 
significantly  greater than those in the controls and 
exceeded  the NTP historical range s for feed study 
controls( Tables 25, C4b, and D4b).  Compared to the 
exophytic masses with well-differentiated squamous 
epithelium typic al of the squamous cellpapillomas, the 
squamous  cell carcinoma s we re locally invasive 
neoplasms  that sometimes resulted in perforation  of theforest omach (Plate 11). Frequently, asquamo uscell 
carcinoma  appeared to arise at the base of a squamous 
cell papilloma.  Metastatic neoplasms arising from 
squamous  cell carcinomas of t he forestomach were 
observed in the coagulatingglands,colon , duodenum, 
epididymis, gallbladder, glandular stomac h, jejunum , 
kidney,  liver, lung, ovary, pancreas,  prostate  gland, 
spleen, testis, and thym us of exposed mi ce (Tables C1 
and D1). 
Nonneoplastic  lesions of the forestomach included 
acanthosis, hyperkeratosis,an d basal cell hyperplasia 
(Tables  25, C5, and D5).  At the 15-mont h interi m 
evaluation, therewere exposure-related increases in the 
incidences  and severities of aca nthosis and 
hyperkeratosis in exposed groups of males and females. 
At the end of the 2-year study, the incidences and 
severities of these lesions inexposedgroupsof malesan d 
females weregenerally greater than those inthecontro ls.  74 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

Lung:  Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were 
observed  in exposed groups of males and  females 
at the 15-month interim evaluation  (Tables 26,  C1, 
and D1).   During  the 2-year study, the incidences 
of alveol ar/bronchiolar adenomas in exposed 
groups of males and females wer e significantly 
increased  (Tables 26, C3,  and D3).  In male mice, 
the incidences of multiple alveolar/bronchi olar 
adenomas  in exposed groups were significantly 
greater  than that in the controls (Tables 26, C1, 
and D1). The incidences of alveolar/ 
TABLE  26 bronchiolar adenoma in exposed groups of males 
and females exceeded the NTP historical ranges 
for feed study controls  (Tables 26, C4c, and D4c). 
The alveolar/bronchiol ar adenomas were gene rally 
well-circumscribed,  expansile masses th at slightly 
compress ed the surrounding normal pulmonary 
alveolar  tissue (Plate 12).  Well-different iated 
cuboidal  to columnar epithelial cells formed 
papillary  structures or solid foci  that filled alveolar 
spaces.

Kidney: Pigmentation waspresent in the kidneys of most 
mice  after 2 years of exposure to 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  (males:  0 ppm, 0/50; 
10,000 ppm, 42/51; 20,000 ppm, 43/50; females: 0/50, 
43/50, 43/50; Tables C5andD5). Thisbrown, granular 
pigment in therenal tubule epithelium andtubule lumin a 
resembled thepigment described inthe liver. Therewere 
no other chemical-related lesions in the kidney. 
Uterus: There was a significant, but not exposure-
related,  increase in  the incidence of uterine polyps  or 
sarcomas (combined) (0/50, 5/50, 0/50; Table D1) in the 
10,000 ppmfemales. Although thisincidenc e(10%) was 
above  the average for historical controls  (3.5%),  the 
combined incidence was within the historical control 
range (0%-16%; Table D4d). Thismarginal increase was 
not considered  to be chemical related.  There were  no 
chemical-related nonneoplastic lesions in the reprodu c-
tive tract (Table D5). Pituitary Gland: A significant, but no t exposure-related , 
increase  in the  incidence  of adenoma of the pituitary 
gland  (pars distalis) was  observed in the 10,000  ppm 
females (1/43, 9/45,4/43; TableD1). The incidence of 
adenoma  (20%) in the 10,000 ppm females is slightly 
above the average for historical controls (15.2%), but is 
withinthehistorical range (2%-36%; Table D4e). This 
marginal  increase  was not considered to  be chemical 
related . Theinciden ceofhyperplasia oftheparsdistali s 
of the pituitary glandwas also inc reased in the 10,000 -
 ppm females (7/43, 22/45, 7/43; Table D5). 
DISPOSITION 
AND METABOLISM STUDIES 
AdultmaleF344/Nrats received [14C]-labeled1-amino -
2,4-dibro moanthraquinone as a single intravenous dose 
of 0.4 mg1-amino-2,4-dibromoanth raquin one/kg body 
weight  or as a single oral dose of 2, 23, 118, 814, or 
1,473 mg/kg. After excreta were collected for72hours, 
the animals were killed, and tissues were removed for 
analysis. Additional anima lsthat receivedintravenou s 
doses of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoant hraqu inone werekille d 
0.25, 0.75, 2, 6, or 24 hours after chemical administra -
tion, and their tissues  were analyzed.  A 6-hour bile 
cannulation study was also performed. Fromday 0 throug hday3 after intravenous admini stra-
tion of [14C]-1-am ino-2,4-dibromoanthraqui none, about 
50% of the 14C was  excreted in the feces, 15% in the 
urine, and 6% in expired air. Unmetabolize d 1-amino -
2,4-dib romoanthra quinone accounted forlessthan3%of 
the excreted 14Cafter intravenous administration. The 
amount ofanoraldosethatwasabsorbed was calculate d 
fromthepercent of the dose that was excreted in expire d 
airorurine afteroraladmini stration versus thepercent of 
the dose excreted after intra veno us administration. 
Excretion of 14Cinexpired airyieldedthe most consis -
tent results.  For oral doses greater than or equal to 
2mg/kg, the amount of the dose thatwasabsorbed fitted 
the equation: absorbed dose  = 6.6 log(dose), with 
both doses expressed in mg/kg.  W hile 90% of the 
2 mg/kg  dose was abs orbed, only 2% of the 814 mg/k g 
dose was absorbed. 
Two hours afterintravenous administration, lessthan3% 
of the circulatin g 14Cwas attributed tothe parent com-
pound.  The  metabolites of 1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinon einblood werepri marilyin th e 
plasm a fraction (blood:plasma ratioo f approximately 
0.5:1).  The highest concentrations  of 14C in tissues 
15 minu tes after intraveno us dosing were in excretor y 
organs, lung, kidney, smallintestin e,liver, adipose tissue , 
and adrenal gland. Tissue:blood ratios (TBR) for these 
tissues were greater than or equal to3:1. Only theliver 
and kidney had TBRs sig nificantly greater than 1:1 at 
72 hours.  The  terminal half-life of 14C was approxi-
mately 40 hours in the liver and approximately 90 hours 
in the kidney.  Adipose tissue contained primarily 
unmetabolized1-amino-2,4-dibr omoanthraquino ne at 
24 hours; liver, muscle, and skin con tained mostly 
metabolites of1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquino ne. The 
elimination  half-l ife of 1-amino -
2,4-dib romoanthraquinone inadipose tissue was approxi -
mately 11 hours. 
GENETIC TOXICOLOGY 
1-Ami no-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  (100  to 
10,000 :g/plate) was tested for induction of gene muta-
tions  in four strains of Salmonella  typhimurium  in a 
preincubation  protocol with a nd withou t 
Aroclor  1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat or 
Syrian hamste r liver S9 (Table G1; Haworth et al. , 
1983).   1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was   
 
 
          
 
 
 
 Results 79 
positive  in the absence of S9 in the frameshift 
strains TA98 and TA1537; with S9, an equivocal 
response  was obtained  in TA1537,  and TA98 was 
negative.  In TA100,  1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthra-
quinone gave  equivocal responses with and  with-
out S9,  and all trials were negative with  TA1535. 
The equivocal  calls were the results of positive  or 
weakly  positive r espo nses that were not duplicated 
in a second trial. Precipitation of 1-amin o-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone  occurred  at concentra-
tions  of 100 jg/plate and above, and this may have 
been  a factor in the nonreproducibility of the 
results. 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthra quinone was tested in 
two laboratories  for induction of sister chromatid 
exchang es and chromosomal aberrations in cul-
tured  Chinese hamste r ovary cells, with and 
without  Aroclor 125 4-induced male Sprague-
Dawley  rat liver S9.  In the sis ter chromatid 
exchange test, one   laboratory  observed a significant increase in sister 
chrom atid exchanges only in the absence of S9, 
while  the second laboratory recorded positive 
responses  with and without S9 (Table G2; Love-
day et al. , 1990).  This discrepancy cannot be 
explained  by a difference  in dose levels  employed 
at the two laboratories because the positiv e re-
sponses  with S9 were observed at  3, 1 0, 15, and 
30 jg/mL at the second laboratory, whereas 
negat ive trials resulted from testing doses up to 
100 jg/mL at the  first  laboratory.  In the chromo-
somal aberrations test, one laboratory observed a 
weakly  positive response only  in the absence of S9 
(Table  G3).  Another laboratory obtained a posi-
tive respons e in the first trial without S9 but did 
not duplicate the positive response in the  secon d 
trial, and the overall call without S9 was con-
cluded  to be equivo cal (Loveday et al. , 1990). 
Neither  laboratory observed an increase in chro-
mosomal aberrations with 1-amin o-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in the presence of S9.    80 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
 
Anthraquinonesrepresent the largest groupof natu-
rallyoccurringquinones. Both natural andsyntheti c 
anthraquinones have been and continue to be widely 
used as color antsinfood, drugs, cosmetics, hairdyes, 
and textiles. Dantron (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone ) 
andemodin (1,3,8-tr ihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone ) 
arealso used therapeutically as catharti cs and purga -
tives.   Chry sophanol (1,8-dihydr oxy-
3-methylanthraquinone) occursin cascara  sagrada, 
senna,  and various specie s of Rumex  and Rheum 
(rhubarb). 
Anthraquinoneand five substitute danthraquinone s 
were selec ted for toxicologic characterization from a 
large  group of amino-, alkyl-, nitro-, or halogen-
containing  anthraquino nes. Thebasis forselec tion 
centered mainl y on four criteria: 1) lack of available 
data on carcinog enicity, 2) magnitude of production 
and use patterns, 3) awarenes s of potential and actua l 
human exposure,4) and representa tion of as broad  a 
spectrum  of structural d iversity within this class as 
possible . 1-Ami no-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was 
selected from a groupof 36 environmenta llysignifi -
cant aryl bromides.  Since all other substituted 
anthraquinone chemicals alreadyev aluated for long-
termeffects induced carcinoge nicresponses in labora -
toryanimals (NCI, 1978a, 1978b, 1978c; IARC, 1982 , 
1987;  NTP, 1986 a), 1-amino-2,4 -
dibromoanthraquinone was predicted to be carcino-
genic  in laboratory animals as well (Fung et al., 
1993). 
1-Amino-2,4-dibr omoanthraq uinone was studied for 
long-te rmtoxicity and carcinogenesis using a "start -
stop" experimental design. Oneofthefirstchemical s 
to be studied by the National Toxicology Program 
(NTP)  with a start-stop protoc ol, 1-amino-
2,4-dibrom oanthraquinone was predicted to be carci-
nogenic, sotheexper imental design wasselected inan 
attempt to gain some insight into  the progression 
and/or regression ofchemical-induced lesions as well 
as to perhaps gainknowledge about potential mecha -
nisms of action. 
Because 1-amino-2,4- dibromoanthraquinone cause d 
significant carcinogeni c respon sesinmale andfemal e rats and mice and in several  organs and  tissues, the 
discussio noflesions thatfollows hasbeen grouped by 
organ. Liver: 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone differs 
from other chemicals studied by the NTP because it 
induced  greater than 90% incidences of multiple 
benig nandmalignanthepatocellular neoplasms inrats 
with frequent metastases (almost 50%) of the malig-
nant liver neoplasms.  Although other chemicals 
including  3,3N-dimeth ylbenzidine dihydrochlo ride 
(NTP,  1991) and furan (NTP,  1993a) have  caused 
significant  increases  in benign and malignant  liver 
neoplasms that approach a 100% incidence, metastase s 
occurred  in only one or two  instances in a group of 
50 rats.  Only in the 18-month study of methyl 
carbamate (NTP, 1988) hasa similarly highincidenc e 
of malig nant,metastatic liver neoplasms occurred in 
male rats. The liver lesions prese nt after 13 weeks in the 25,00 0 
and 50,000 ppmgroups of ratsincluded proliferativ e 
bile duct lesions (cholangiofibrosis) and foci of 
hepatocellular alteration.  Based on morphological 
features  of this pr olife rative bile duct lesion and 
results of transpl antation and stop- exposure studies , 
cholangiofibro sis has been considered a 
"premalignant"  lesion which is autonomous and 
progressive  and not qualitatively different f rom 
chola ngiocarcinoma (Maronpot et al., 1991). Whil e 
thereissome disagreement onthebiological behavio r 
of cholangiofibrosis, thishas generally been consid -
ered to be a preneoplastic lesion (Ba nnasch and 
Massner,  1976; Ohshim a et al., 1984) . 
Cholangiofibrosis  has been described in toxicity 
studies of methap yrile ne (Ohshima et al. , 1984), 
aflatoxin  (Wilson et al.,  1985), and furan (NTP, 
1993a) in rats. Exposure conc entrati ons of 1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone administered in the 
2-year study were below those which produced 
cholangiof ibrosis at 13 weeks; however, many of 
the benign and malignant liver neoplasms in the 
2-year study in rats were composed of a mixed

       82 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
of hepatocellular alteration were increased with 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone exposure at 
13 weeks and all scheduled intervals examined 
during  the 2-year study.  A detailed analysis of foc i 
of hepatocellular alteration in the liv er of rats fro m 
thisstudyhas been reported by Harada et al.(1989) . 
In addition to overall exposure-related increased 
incidences of eosinophilic and clear cell foci of 
alteration, there wereincreases in size, number, and 
volum efraction of atypical eosinophi lic, basophilic, 
and clear cellfoci in ratsthat correlated withconcen -
tration and duration of 1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone exposure. 
Although foci of hepatocel lular alteration in ratsare 
believed to be precursors  of liver neoplasms, t heir 
biological nature and potential for progression to 
neoplasms is uncertain (Popp and Goldsworthy, 
1989; Squire, 1989). Some ofthisuncertainty result s 
from a considerable variation in phenotypes of 
hepatocellular foci and the different biomarkers used 
in their classificatio n. Inmany  studies, the conver -
sion rateof foci to neoplasms has been considered to 
be extremely low, and, in some instances, incre ases 
in the incidences of basophilic foci have not been 
associated with liver neoplasms (MacDon ald et al. , 
1988; Harada et al., 1989; Squire, 1989). Clear and 
acidophilic cell foci have been suggested to be 
important in the development of some chemical-
induced liver neoplasms (Bannasch et al., 1989; 
Bannasch and Zerban, 1992).  The atypical 
eosinophilic  foci that occurred in ratsadministere d 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone were rarely 
observed in controls or in groups of rats receivi ng 
other hepatocarcinogens (Harada et al., 1989 ). 
Adenomas in the livers of ratstreated with1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone often contained cells 
morphologically identical to those in the atypical 
eosinophi lic foci, suggesting that some of these foci 
mayhave been precursors for the hepatic neoplasms . 
Liver effects in male mice administered 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraq uinone for13weeks consisted of 
pigmentation andhypertrophy that persisted through -
outthe2-yearstud y.  Although hypertrop hydidnot 
occur in female mice during this early period, pig-
mentation in the liver was present by 15 months. 
Foci of hepatocellular alteration were not present in 
the 13-week study, and after 2 years, the incidence s 
were  only slig htlyincreased inmice.  After 2 years , 
there were increased incidences of liver neoplasms in all groups of mice exposed to 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraqui none in feed.  This respons e 
was more prominent in females that also had a 
greater number of hepatocellular carcinomas and 
more multiple liver neoplasms than male mice. 
Unlike the highly metastatic liver neoplasms ob-
served in rats, only a few neoplasms in mice had 
detectable metastatic foci. The incidences of 
hepatoblastomas were also increased in the expose d 
groups  of male and female mice.  These distinctiv e 
liver neoplasms rar elyoccur in control animals bu t 
have been induced in mice administered 
acetylaminofluorene (Nonoyama et al., 1988) or 
N-nitrosodiethylamine (Ward et al., 1983). 
Large Intestine: Adenomatous po lyps(adenomas ) 
and carcin omas of the large intestine (distal colon 
and rectum) in rats were generally observed after 
15 m onths of exposure to 1-am ino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone ,although one adenom a-
tous polyp (adenoma) was observed as early as 9 
month s in the 20,00 0 ppm group of male rats in th e 
"stop-exposure"  study.  Further, these lesions wer e 
often grossly visible. Even when exposure was 
stopped after 9 months, the perc entage of chemical -
inducedrectal neoplasms was equal to or greater than 
that observed with continuous exposure for 15 
months. Inmany rats,these neoplasms were multip le 
and malignant, based upon local invasion and/or 
metas tases.   Neoplasms of the large intestine have 
not been observed for other previously tested 
anthraquinones. One other chemical stu diedbythe 
NTP,bromodichloromethane (NTP, 1987a), resulte d 
in similarly high incidences of benign and maligna nt 
neoplasms of the large intestine. 
Kidney: Accumulation of pigment in the kidneywas 
observed  in both male and female rats by  13 weeks 
and throughout the 2-year s tudy.  1-Amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinon e(or metabolite) pigmen t 
in the kidney o f mic e was not evident until after 
the 15-month evaluation; there  were no increased 
incidences ofother nonneoplast iclesions orneoplasm s 
of the kidney in mice.  In  the kidney  of rats, several 
changes  in addition to pigment were present at 13 
weeks.   In male rat s, inc reased accumulation of 
hyaline  droplets was  observed in the cytoplasm of 
the renal tubule epithelium, yet no chemical-related 
exacerbation of renal tubule epithel ial regener ation 
was observed at 13 weeks.  There was a s light 
enlargement (karyomegaly) ofsome nuclei intherenal 
tubule  epithelium of male and female rats.

       83 Discussion and Conclusions 
the 15-month evaluation, thisslight nuclear enlarge -
ment was still evident, and the severity of 
nephrop athy(tubule epithelial regeneration; transi -
tional cell hyperplasia of the renal pelvis) was 
increased inexpose dmale andfemale rats. Accumu -
lation of hyaline droplets was not pres ent in expose d 
male ratsa fterthe9-month evaluation. Themorpho-
logical appearance of hyaline droplets and their 
presence onlyin males is suggestive of accumulatio n 
of " 2:-globulin in the renal tubule epithelium, al-
though the identity of the protein droplets was not 
determin ed. Their absence inthekidney tubule cells 
of exposed malerats after the 9- month eval uation is 
consistent withthe normally decreased production of 
" 2:-globulin by the liver beginning at 5 months of 
age (Baetck e et al., 1991). Chemicals that cause a 
hyaline droplet nephropathy syndrome are often 
empirically associated with increases in the inci-
denc es of benign and malignant renal tubule 
neoplasms, linear foci of mineralization of the renal 
medulla, andenhanc ed nephropathy in male ratsafter 
2 years (Baetcke et al. , 1991);however, other alter-
native mechanistic explanations exist that do not 
show a dominant ro le for " 2:-globulin. Thekeyto 
thisview centers on several chemical s that incitethe 
"hyaline droplet syndrome," yet do not induce tubul e 
cellneopl asms ofthe kidney (Barrett and Huff, 1991 ; 
Huff,1992, 1993; Melnick, 1992).  Another stron g 
neoplastic response in the kidney of female rats 
shows that mechani sms other than those associate d 
with hyaline droplet nephropathy were involved i n 
the renal tubule neoplasm response in rats adminis -
tered 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraqu inone. Increase d 
incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the 
kidney  occurred in male and female rats in the NT P 
study of bromodichloromethane (NTP, 1987a). 
Urinary  Bladder: Chemical-related increased 
incidences of proliferative lesions (hyperp lasia and 
neoplasia)  of the transitional cell e pithelium of th e 
urinary bladder occurred inmale andfemale ratswith 
a greater num ber of neoplas ms observed in femal e 
rats(45/146, 31%) than in male rats (16/146, 1 1%). 
In the stop-exposure groups, transiti onal cellhyper -
plasia was present in four female rats at 9 months, 
and, with the absence of continued chem ical expo -
sure, hyperplasia did not develop in male rats a t the 
15-month evaluation. Atransitional cellcarcinoma 
occurred in one female rat fromthe 15-monthe xpo-
sure group.  With continuous exposure to 1-amino -
2,4-dibromo anthraquinone,  benign and malignan t 
neoplas ms of the urinary bladde r developed by 15 months in female  rats and in bot h 
male and female rats after 2 years of exposure. In 
rats following chronic administra tion of 
1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone, a spectrum of 
nonneoplas tic lesions and neop lasms of the urinar y 
bladder was observed with similar morphologic 
features including squamous meta plasia, squamou s 
cell carcinoma, and proliferation of fat (fatty 
metaplasia) in the wallof the urina rybladder (NTP , 
1986a). In that study, calculi were present in the 
urinarybladder of most rats, yet there was a signifi -
cant increase in the incidence of smooth muscle 
neoplasms ofthewall oftheurinary bladder. The 
hypothesis  of ce ll proliferation and development of 
urinary bladder neoplasms has been described 
(Greenfield et al., 1984; Cohen et al., 1991). The 
mech anism for formation of neoplasms oftheurinar y 
bladder is uncertain. Increased cell proliferation 
evidenced by transitional cell hyperplasia in the 
urinary bladder didnot occur before 9months in rats. 
Poten tial local irritant effects and associated  neo-
plasm formation in the urinary bladd er attributed to 
calculus formati on (Okumara et al. , 1992) were not 
identified  inthisstudy. Most mice inthat study ha d 
calculi  of the urin ary bladder, yet did not have any 
evidence of carcinogenic activity. No scientific 
consensus exists that endorses the notion that calculi 
or stones cause cancer; there may be some co-
carcino genic or promotion activity, yet even thisdoes 
not occur consistently (Huff, 1992, 1993). 
Forestomach: In both rats and mice, there were 
several nonneoplastic prolifera tive and inflammator y 
lesions in the forestomach at the end of the 2-year 
studies. These forestomach lesions were not ob-
served in either  species in the 13-week studies or i n 
rats at the 9- and 1 5-month evaluations. Inthe stop -
exposure evaluation, rats exposed to 20,000 ppm 
develope dnonneoplastic lesions of the forestomac h 
by 15 months. Howev er, in the 9-month stop-
exposur e group, forestomach lesions were observe d 
in a few m ales by the 15-month evaluation, but th e 
incidences were higher tha n those observed in male 
rats with the continuous 15-month exposure. In 
female rats, forestomach lesions were present at 
15 months with continuous exposure but were no t 
observed at 9 months or after 6 mont hs of 
nonexposure . Chemical-related lesions consisted of 
hyperplasia, hyperkerato sisand associated inflamma -
tion, and focal erosion or ulceration of the squamou s 
mucosa.   The inflammato ry and ulcerative lesions 
were generally more severe and more common in         
    
        
      
  
         
       
       
    
      
      
        
     
    
       
       
    
       
      
      
 
 
    
        
      
      
    
  
   
     
    
       
       
         
      
  
 
    
   
       
  
          
       
     
    
      
     
 
  
    
        
  
      
     
   
       
   
    
       
    
       
  
    
      
      
       
     
   
      
    
       
   
      
   
     
  
     
     
    
      
     
    
     
    
__________ 84 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
rats, but significant increases in the incidences of 
benig n and malignant forestomach neoplasms were 
limited tomice. These dataprovi de further evide nce 
that inflammation or ulceration does not always 
result in neoplasia  (Berenblum, 1944; Huff, 199 2, 
1993; Melnick et al., 1993a, 1993b). The absence of 
forestomach neoplasms in ratsmayhave been relate d 
to lower exposure concentrations. Many of the 
malignant forestomach neoplasms of mice 
metastasized or invaded adjacent organs. 
Increa ses in the incidences offorestomach neoplasm s 
have not been observed in mice or rats following 
long-term  administrati on of four other structurall y 
related anthraquinones. However, administra tionof 
1-amino-2- methylanthraquinone (NCI, 1978b) to rats 
for 62 weeks followed by a 6-month nonexposure 
period was associated with an increased incidence in 
hyperplasia  of the forestomach.  Adm inistra tion o f 
2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinon e(NCI, 1978c) to rats 
for 78 weeks followed by a 6-month nonexposure 
period was also associa ted with an increased inci-
dence of proliferative lesions of the forestomach. 
Marked  increases in t he incidence s of forestomac h 
neoplasms  have bee n reported  for some chemical s 
that caused a sustained proliferative response in the 
squamous mucosa that was evident within the first 2 
to 13 weeks of chemical administration (NTP, 
1987b). However, a number of other chemicals 
causing forestomach neoplasm s in rodents have not 
been  associated with an early, sustained increase  in 
the incidence of hyperplasia (NTP, 19 90a, 1990b, 
1990c). 
Lung: The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar 
adenoma and multiplealveolar/bro nchiolar adenom a 
(males only) of the lung were significantly increase d 
in mice in the 10,000 and 20,000 ppm groups. 
Althou ghthere was no evidence for an increase in the 
incidence  of hyperplasia or for a prog ression  of th e 
lung neoplasms to malignancy, the incidence of 
adenoma  in all four e xposure groups exceed ed th e 
NTP  historical control ranges.  Administration of a 
structurally related anthraquinone, C.I. Disperse 
Blue 1 (1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone) (NTP, 
1986a), resulted in a marginal increase in the 
incidence of alveolar/bronch iolar adenoma in male 
mice with no associated increase in the incide nce of alveolar/bronchiolar  hyperplasia. Other chemical s 
tested by the NTP have also caused increased 
incidences of lung neoplasms without increased 
incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasia (NTP , 
1994), but more comm only an i ncrease in the inci-
dence of alveolar/bronchiola r hyperplasia or inflam-
mation  is also present with incre ased incide nces o f 
lung neoplasms (NTP, 1986b, 1989,  1990a, 1992) . 
Although the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar 
carcinoma was not increased in the lungs of mice 
admin istered 1-amino-2,4-dib romoanthraquinone, a 
number of chemicals have induced both alveolar/ 
bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (NTP, 1990b , 
1990c, 1993b; Huff, 1994). 
CONCLUSIONS 
Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, 
there  was clear evid ence of carcinogenic activity* 
of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquin one in male and 
female F344/N ratsbased on increased incidences of 
neopl asms  in the liv er, large intestine, kidney, and 
urinary bladder. There was clear evidence of 
carcinogenic activity  of 1-ami no -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female 
B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of 
neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung. 
Exposure of male and female rats to 1-amino-
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 2 yearswasassociate d 
with basophilic focus (males only), clear cellfocus , 
eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the liver; 
renal tubule hyperpla sia, ren al tubule pigmentation , 
and transitional cellhyperplasia in the kidney; transi -
tional  cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and 
stromal metaplasia (females only) in the urinary 
bladder; squamous hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, 
ulceration, and inflammation of the forestomach 
mucosa;  and semi nalvesicle atrophy.  Exposure o f 
male and female mice to 1-amino -
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for2 years wasassociate d 
withcentrilobular hepat ocellular hypertrophy (male s 
only), basophilic focus, clear cell focus (females 
only), eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the 
liver;  pigmentati on in the kidney; and hyperplasia , 
basal cellhyperplasia, hyperkeratosis ,and inflamma -
tion of the forestomach mucosa.

pancreatic islets, pituitary gland, preputial gland, stomach, testes, thyroid gland, and urinary bladder; for other tissues, de nominator is number of animals necropsied. b	 Kaplan-Meier estimated neoplasm incidence at the end of the study after adjustment for intercurrent mortality c	 Observed incidence at terminal kill d	 Beneath the control incidence are the P valu es associated with the trend test.  Bene ath the exposed group incidence are the P v alues corresponding to pairwise comparisons 
between the controls and that exposed group.  The life table analysis regards neoplasms in animals dying prior to terminal kill  as being (directly or indirectly) the cause of 
death.  The logistic regression test regards these lesions as nonfatal.  The Cochran-Armitage and Fisher exact tests compare di rectly the overall incidence rates.  For all tests, 
a negative trend or a lower incidence in an exposure group is indicated by N. e Not applicable; no neoplasms in animal group f Value of statistic cannot be computed. 135 Lesions in Male Rats

a Number of lesion-bearing animals/number of animals examined.  De nominator is number of animals examined microscopically for adr enal gland, clitoral gland, kidney, liver, 
lung, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, urinary bladder, and uterus; for other tissues, denominator is number of animals necropsi ed. b	 Kaplan-Meier estimated neoplasm incidence at the end of the study after adjustment for intercurrent mortality c	 Observed incidence at terminal kill d	 Beneath the control incidence are the P valu es associated with the trend test.  Bene ath the exposed group incidence are the P v alues corresponding to pairwise comparisons 
between the controls and that exposed group.  The life table analysis regards neoplasms in animals dying prior to terminal kill  as being (directly or indirectly) the cause of 
death.  The logistic regression test regards these lesions as nonfatal.  The Cochran-Armitage and Fisher exact tests compare di rectly the overall incidence rates.  For all tests, 
a negative trend or a lower incidence in an exposure group is indicated by N. e Not applicable; no neoplasms in animal group 189 Lesions in Female Rats

a Number of lesion-bearing animals/number of animals examined.  De nominator is number of animals examined microscopically for liv er, lung, and stomach; for other tissues, 
denominator is number of animals necropsied. b	 Kaplan-Meier estimated neoplasm incidence at the end of the study after adjustment for intercurrent mortality c	 Observed incidence at terminal kill d	 Beneath the control incidence are the P valu es associated with the trend test.  Bene ath the exposed group incidence are the P v alues corresponding to pairwise comparisons 
between the controls and that exposed group.  The life table analysis regards neoplasms in animals dying prior to terminal kill  as being (directly or indirectly) the cause of 
death.  The logistic regression test regards these lesions as nonfatal.  The Cochran-Armitage and Fisher exact tests compare di rectly the overall incidence rates.  For all tests, 
a negative trend or a lower incidence in an exposure group is indicated by N. e Not applicable; no neoplasms in animal group  237 Lesions in Male Mice

a Number of lesion-bearing animals/number of animals examined.  De nominator is number of animals examined microscopically for liv er, lung, pituitary gland, stomach, thyroid 
gland, and uterus; for other tissues, denominator is number of animals necropsied. b	 Kaplan-Meier estimated neoplasm incidence at the end of the study after adjustment for intercurrent mortality c	 Observed incidence at terminal kill d	 Beneath the control incidence are the P valu es associated with the trend test.  Bene ath the exposed group incidence are the P v alues corresponding to pairwise comparisons 
between the controls and that exposed group.  The life table analysis regards neoplasms in animals dying prior to terminal kill  as being (directly or indirectly) the cause of 
death.  The logistic regression test regards these lesions as nonfatal.  The Cochran-Armitage and Fisher exact tests compare di rectly the overall incidence rates.  For all tests, 
a negative trend or a lower incidence in an exposure group is indicated by N. e Not applicable; no neoplasms in animal group  278 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

compares directly the overall incidence rates.  For all tests, a lower incidence in an exposure group is indicated by

GENETIC TOXICOLOGY 
SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM MUTAGENICITY TEST PROTOCOL 
Testing was performed as reported by Haworth et al.  (1983). 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was 
sent to the laboratory as a coded aliquot from Radian Corporation (Austin, TX).  It was incubated with 
the Salmonella typhimurium  tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 either in buffer or S9 mix 
(metabolic activation enzymes and cofactors from Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat or 
Syrian hamster liver) for 20 minutes at 37° C.  Top agar supplemented with l-histidine and d-biotin was 
added, and the contents of the tubes were mixed and poured onto the surfaces of minimal glucose agar 
plates.  Histidine-independent mutant colonies arising on these plates were counted following incubation for 2 days at 37° C. 
Each trial consisted of triplicate plates of concurrent positive and negative controls and of five doses of 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone.  The high dose was limited to 10,000 
:g/plate. All positive trials 
were repeated under the conditions that elicited the positive response.  If no positive responses were seen, all negative trials were repeated. 
In this assay, a positive response is defined as a reproducible, dose-related increase in histidine­
independent (revertant) colonies in any one strain/activation combination.  An equivocal response is 
defined as an increase in revertants that is not dose related, not reproducible, or is of insufficient magnitude to support a determination of mutagenicity.  A negative response was obtained when no increase in revertant colonies was observed following chemical treatment.  There was no minimum 
percentage or fold increase required for a chemical to the judged positive or weakly positive. 
CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY CELL CYTOGENETICS PROTOCOLS 
Testing was performed as reported by Loveday et al.  (1990). 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was 
sent to each of two testing laboratories as a coded aliquot by Radian Corporation.  The aliquots were tested in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations (Abs), both in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9 and cofactor mix.  Cultures were handled under gold lights to prevent photolysis of bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA.  Each test consisted of concurrent solvent and 
positive controls and of at least three doses of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone.  A single flask per dose was used, and tests yielding equivocal or positive results were repeated. 
Sister Chromatid Exchange Test: In the SCE test without S9, CHO cells were incubated for 26 hours 
with 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with fetal bovine 
serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was added 2 hours after culture 
initiation. After 26 hours, the medium containing 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was removed 
and replaced with fresh medium plus BrdU and Colcemid, and incubation was continued for 2 hours. 
Cells were then harvested by mitotic shake-off, fixed, and stained with Hoechst 33258 and Giemsa. 
In the SCE test with S9, cells were incubated with 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, serum-free 
medium, and S9 for 2 hours. The medium was then removed and replaced with medium containing 
serum and BrdU and no 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone and incubation proceeded for an 
additional 26 hours, with Colcemid present for the final 2 hours. Harvesting and staining were the 
same as for cells treated without S9. All slides were scored blind and those from a single test were 
read by the same person. Usually, 50 second-division metaphase cells were scored for frequency of 
SCEs/cell from each dose level. The high dose was limited by toxicity.   
            
             
               
              
                
             
                
          
                 
             
                
                
              
                   
                
           327 Genetic Toxicology 
Statistical analyses were conducted on the slopes of the dose-response curves and the individual dose points 
(Galloway et al. , 1987). An SCE frequency 20% above the concurrent solvent control value was chosen as a 
statistically conservative positive response.  The probability of this level of difference occurring by chance at 
one dose point is less than 0.01; the probability for such a chance occurrence at two dose points is less than 
0.001.   An increase of 20% or greater at any single dose was considered weak evidence of activity; increases at 
two or more doses resulted in a determination that the trial was positive.  A statistically significant trend 
(P#0.005) in the absence of any responses reaching 20% above background led to a call of equivocal. 
Chromosomal Aberrations Test: In the Abs test without S9, cells were incubated in McCoy's 5A medium with 
1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 8 to 10 hours; Colcemid was added and incubation continued for 2 
hours. The cells were then harvested by mitotic shake-off, fixed, and stained with Giemsa.  For the Abs test 
with S9, cells were treated with 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone and S9 for 2 hours, after which the treatment medium was removed and the cells incubated for 10 to 11 hours in fresh medium, with Colcemid present for the final 2 hours.  Cells were harvested in the same manner as for the treatment without S9.  The high dose was limited to 100 
:g/mL. 
Cells were selected for scoring on the basis of good morphology and completeness of karyotype (21 ± 2 chromosomes).  All slides were scored blind and those from a single test were read by the same person. Two hundred first-division metaphase cells were scored at each dose level.  Classes of aberrations included simple (breaks and terminal deletions), complex (rearrangements and translocations), and other 
(pulverized cells, despiralized chromosomes, and cells containing 10 or more aberrations). 
Chromosomal aberration data are presented as percentage of cells with aberrations.  To arrive at a statistical 
call for a trial, analyses were conducted on both the dose response curve and individual dose points.  For a 
single trial, a statistically significant (P
#0.05) difference for one dose point and a significant trend (P #0.015) 
are considered weak evidence for a positive response; significant differences for two or more doses indicated the trial was positive. A positive trend test in the absence of a statistically significant increase at any one dose 
resulted in an equivocal call (Galloway et al. , 1987).  Ultimately, the trial calls were based on a consideration 
of the statistical analyses as well as the biological information available to the reviewers . 
RESULTS 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (100 to 10,000 :g/plate) was tested for induction of gene mutations in 
four strains of Salmonella typhimurium in a preincubation protocol with and without Aroclor 1254-induced 
male Sprague-Dawley rat or Syrian hamster liver S9 (Table G1; Haworth et al., 1983). 1-Amino­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was positive in the absence of S9 in the frameshift strains TA98 and TA1537; 
with S9, an equivocal response was obtained in TA1537, and TA98 was negative. In TA100, 1-amino­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone gave equivocal responses with and without S9, and all trials were negative in 
TA1535. The equivocal calls were the results of positive or weakly positive responses that were not 
duplicated in a second trial. Precipitation of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone occurred at 
concentrations of 100 :g/plate and above, and this may have been a factor in the nonreproducibility of the 
results. 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was tested in two laboratories for induction of SCEs and Abs in cultured 
CHO cells, with and without Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawl ey rat liver S9. In the SCE test, 
Environmental Health Research & Testing observed a significant increase in SCEs only in the absence of S9, 
while Bioassay Systems Corporation recorded positive responses with and without S9 (Table G2; Loveday et 
al., 1990). The discrepancy with S9 cannot be explained by a difference in dose levels employed at the two 
laboratories because positive responses were seen at 3, 10, 15, and 30 :g/mL at Bioassay Systems Corporation, 
whereas negat ive trials resulted from testing doses up to 100 :g/mL at              
                
                
                 
             
     328 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383 
Environmental Health Research & Testing. In the Abs test, Environmental Health Research & 
Testing observed a weakly positive response only in the absence of S9 (Table G3). Bioassay Systems 
Corporation obtained a positive response in the first trial without S9 but did not duplicate the positive 
response in the second trial (Table G3), and the overall call without S9 was concluded to be equivocal 
(Loveday et al., 1990). Neither laboratory observed an increase in Abs with 1-amino­
2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in the presence of S9.

CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND 
DOSE FORMULATION STUDIES 
PROCUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION 
OF 1-A MINO -2,4- DIBROMOANTHRAQUINONE 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was obtained from Amer ican Color and Chemical Corporation (Charlotte, NC) (lot 
1076-C) and Mobay Corporation (Pittsburgh, PA).  Lot 1076-C was used in the 13-week studies and for 2 months of the 
2-year studies. For tracking purposes, the lot from Mo bay Corporation was assigned the number M061583 and was used 
throughout the remainder of the 2-year studies. Identity, pu rity, and stability analyses were conducted by the analytical 
chemistry laboratory, Midwest Research Institute (MRI) (Kansas City, MO).  MRI reports on analyses performed in support of 
the 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone stu dies are on file at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. 
The two lots of the study chemical, a reddish brown to orange powder, were identified as 1- amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
by infrared, ultraviolet/visible, and nuclea r magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  All spectra were consistent with those 
expected for the structure or with the literatu re spectra, as shown in Figures I1 and I2. 
The purity of both lots was determined by elemental analysis , Karl Fischer water analysis, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), 
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TLC wa s performed with two systems:  A) aluminum oxide F-254 
Type E plates using a solvent system of hexanes:diethylether (50:50) and B) Whatman RP KC18 F-254 plates using methanol 
as the solvent. Visualization was accomplished with visibl e light and shortwave (254 nm) ul traviolet light for both lots; 
longwave (366 nm) ultraviolet light was also used for visualization of lot M061583.  HPLC  was performed with a Waters 
:Bondapak C18 column with ultraviolet detection at 254 nm using a so lvent system of water: tetrahydrofuran (65:35 for lot 
1076-C and 61:39 for lot M061583) and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute. 
For lot 1076-C, elemental analyses for hydr ogen and nitrogen were in agreement with theoretical values; the elemental 
analysis for carbon was high and the an alysis for bromine was low.  Karl Fisc her water analysis indicated 0.21% ± 0.05% 
water. TLC indicated a major spot and two slight trace impu rities by system A and a major spot and one trace impurity by 
system B. HPLC indicated a major peak and six impurities, with a total impurity area of approximately 20% relative to the 
major peak area. 
The impurities in lot 1076-C were further ide ntified and quantified using HPLC and direct-inlet mass spectrometry.  A filtered 
solution of 0.57 mg/mL 1-amino- 2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in N,N-dimethylformamide was analyzed by HPLC with a Waters 
:Bondapak C18 column with a solvent system of water:acetonitrile (52:48) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute.  A major peak 
and eight impurities with areas of 0.1% or larger were detect ed by ultraviolet light (254 nm ).  No additional impurities were 
observed when the ratio of the solvent was increased linearly  from 48% to 100%.  Three impurities had areas larger than 1% 
of the total peak area. Aliquots of 5.0 mg/mL 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in N,N-dimethylformamide were analyzed 
using the same HPLC system as was used in the impurity profile analysis, but with a solv ent ratio of 53:47.  The fractions 
were then evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 5 mL n-hexane, and concentrated under purified nitrogen to a volume of 
200 :L. The samples were then analyzed using direct-inlet mass spectrometry.  The three impurities with areas greater than 
1% of the major peak area were identified as anthraquinone,  a monoamino-monobromoanthraquinone, and an isomer of the 
major component. Further analysis of the second and th ird of these impurities using proton Fourier transform NMR 
spectroscopy indicated that the structure of the second impu rity, a monoamino-monobromoanthr aquinone, was consistent with 
that of 1-amino-2-bromoanthraquinone, and that the isomer  was probably 2-amino-1,3-dib romoanthraquinone.  Quantitation 
of the impurity identified as anthraquinone using HPLC with a Dupont Zorbax ODS column using a solvent system of water: 
acetonitrile (30:70) and 0.3 mg/mL butyrophenone as an internal standard in dicated approximately 5.0% anthraquinone. 
Quantitation of the impurities identified as 1-amino-2-bromoant hraquinone and an isomer of the major component by the 
HPLC system described for the impurity profile analysis in dicated approximately 4.3% 1-amino-2-bromoanthraquinone and 
approximately 2.2% isomer. The overall purity of  lot 1076-C was determined to be approximately 87%. 
For lot M061583, elemental analyses for carb on, hydrogen, nitrogen, and bromine were in agreement with theoretical values. 
Karl Fischer water analysis indicated 0. 32% ± 0.04% water.  TLC indicated a major  spot and one trace and one slight trace 
impurity by system A and a major spot and one slight trace im purity by system B.  HPLC indicated a major peak and six 
impurities with the same retention times as found for lot 1076- C and a total impurity area of 3% relative to the major peak 
area. Additionally, when the tetrahydrofuran in the solvent wa s increased to 60%, two impurity peaks with areas less than 1% 
of the peak area were observed. A concomitant analysis  of lot 1076-C with lot M061583 w ith the same high-performance 
liquid chromatography system described for the purity analyses , but with a solvent ratio of 50:50 and with octanophenone as 
an internal standard, indicated a 1-am ino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone concentra tion of approximately 112% in lot M061583 
relative to lot 1076-C. The overall purity of l ot M061583 was determined to be approximately 97%. 
Stability studies were performed using the same HPLC system described for the purity determination of lot 1076-C but with a 
solvent  ratio of 55:45 and with octanophenone added as an internal standard. The studies indicated that 1-amino-2,4­Chemical Characterization and Dose Formulations 345 
dibromoanthraquinone, when stored protected from light, was st able as a bulk chemical for 2 weeks at temperatures up to 
60° C. To ensure stability, the bulk chemical was stored in th e dark at 4° ± 3° C throughout the studies.  During the 2-year 
studies, the stability of the bulk chemical was monitored per iodically by the study laboratory using the same HPLC system; no 
degradation of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraqu inone was seen throughout the studies. 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF DOSE FORMULATIONS 
The dose formulations were prepared by mixing appropriate qu antities of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone with feed (Table 
I1). Dosed feed formulations for chronic toxicity testing we re made by preparing a 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/feed 
premix by hand, which was then blended with plain feed in  a Patterson-Kelly twin-shell blender for 15 minutes using an 
intensifier bar. Dose formulations were prepared weekly. 
Homogeneity and stability analyses of the dosed feed preparation s were conducted by the analytical chemistry laboratory.  For 
the homogeneity analyses, the formulations were extracted with 100 mL of acetonitrile, centrifu ged, and then further diluted 
with acetonitrile. The absorbance of the samples was determined versus acetonitrile using ultraviolet spectroscopy at 249 nm. 
For the stability studies, 2,000 ppm feed samples were extracted with 100 mL of an acetonitrile hydrochloride solution (999:1) and centrifuged; the extracts were  then mixed with 0.5 mg/mL octanophenone (internal standard) in aceto-nitrile and 
further diluted with acetonitrile. The samples we re injected into an HPLC system equipped with a 
:Bondapak C18 column 
and a 254 nm filtered detector, with a mobile phase of water: acetonitrile (57:43) at 1 mL/minute.  Homogeneity of these 
formulations was confirmed; stability was established for at le ast 2 weeks when dose formulations were stored in the dark at 
temperatures up to 25° C. 
Periodic analyses of the dose formulations of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone were  conducted at the study laboratory and 
at the analytical chemistry laboratory us ing ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy at  460 nm.  For the 13-week studies, dose 
formulations were analyzed at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the studies (Table I2).  During the 2-year studies, the first 
set of dose formulations and one randomly selected prepara tion every 8 weeks were analyzed (Table I3).  All dose 
formulations for rats and mice were within 10% of the target concentrations during the 13-week and 2-year studies.  Results 
of periodic referee analyses performed by the analytical ch emistry laboratory indicated good agreement with the results 
obtained by the study laboratory (Table I4). 346 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, NTP TR 383

SENTINEL ANIMAL PROGRAM 
METHODS 
Rodents used in the Carcinogenesis Program of the National To xicology Program are produced in optimally clean facilities to 
eliminate potential pathogens that may affect study results. Th e Sentinel Animal Program is part of the periodic monitoring of 
animal health that occurs during the toxic ologic evaluation of chemical compounds. Under this program, the disease state of 
the rodents is monitored via serology on sera from extra (sen tinel) animals in the study rooms.  These animals and the study 
animals are all subject to identical environmental conditions. The sentinel animals come from the same production source and 
weanling groups as the animals used for the studies of chemical compounds. 
Serum samples were collected from randomly selected rats and mice during the 13-week and 2-year studies.  Blood from each 
animal was collected, allowed to clot, and the serum separate d.  The samples were processed appropriately and sent to 
Microbiological Associates, Inc. (Bethesd a, MD) for determination of antibody titers.  The laboratory serology methods and 
viral agents for which testing was performed are tabulated below;  the times at which blood was collected during the studies are 
also listed.
