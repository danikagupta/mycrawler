ABSTRACT
The production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is referred as a second generation biofuel, whose 
processing is one of the most promising technologies under development. There are few available studies on the use of enzymes produced by fungi as active for the biodegradation of lignocellulosic biomass. However, 
the manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzyme presents high potential to degrade lignin and the basidiomycetes 
are the major producers of this oxidase. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the ability of fungi Lentinula edodes and Lentinula boryana to produce this enzyme when cultivated in submerged fermentation system (SS) and also in solid-state fermentation system (SSF) containing Eucalyptus benthamii sawdust with or without corn cob meal. In the SS the greatest MnP expression occurred on the 25
th day, being of 70 UI.L-1 
for L. boryana and of 20 UI.L-1 for L. edodes. In the SSF, the best results were obtained on the 10th day 
for L. edodes, while for L. boryana it happened between the 20th and the 25th days, despite both species 
presented values close to 110 UI.L-1. Therefore, the results indicated that the studied fungi express the 
enzyme of interest and that its production is enhanced when cultivated in solid system.
Key words: basidiomycetes, Eucalyptus benthamii, enzyme, ethanol.

The increase in ecological awareness starting 
in the late 20th century made it clear that the 
great challenge facing humanity for the coming 
decades is balancing the production of goods and 
services, also economic growth, social equity and 
environmental sustainability. Among the issues that 
have been studied lately, lignocellulosic biomass has received increasing attention from the Brazilian 
government and researchers who have dedicated 
time and thought to study the transformation of this 
material, often an environmental problem, into a 
value-added product, such as the second generation 
ethanol, also known as cellulosic biomass ethanol 
or bioethanol.
The lignocellulosic material from wood 
biomass has been viewed as a promising energy source due to its renewable capacity and the 965-973An Acad Bras Cienc (2013) 85 (3)966

amout of carbohydrates (Sun and Cheng 2002). 
However, the use of lignocellulosic biomass to produce ethanol from the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass has as its main technical and economic barriers the difficulty to establish 
an efficient and appropriate pretreatment of raw 
material (McMillan 1994).
The basidiomycetes are highlighted in the 
degradation of lignocellulosic materials due to the fact that they produce enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose, such as: avicelase, carboxymethyl-cellulase and glucosidase (cellulase), which act on the cellulosic portion; xylanases, mannanases, glucanases and galactanases (hemicellulases), 
acting on the hemicellulosic portion and oxidative 
enzymes, as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase, defined as phenoloxidases. They have the ability of acting on phenolic 
compounds as lignin (Coelho 2007). These 
enzymes degrade lignocellulosic materials to produce fermentable sugars for biofuels as an example, the second generation ethanol, making it possible through the bioconversion carried out by 
enzymes like manganese peroxidase (MnP).
MnP is one of the lignolytic enzymes 
expressed by white rot basidiomycetes and has 
been widely studied as active in the decolorization 
of synthetic dyes used in textile industries (Boer 
et al. 2004, Mohorcic et al. 2006, Park et al. 2007). Furthermore, it has been used in studies of biodegradation of lignin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, humic acids and chlorinated 
pollutants (Coelho 2007, Hamid and Rehmana 
2009). Therefore, the remarkable degradation potential of MnP makes it an attractive enzyme for biotechnological applications. The production of commercial enzymes is usually performed by 
biological processes in liquid medium - submerged 
fermentation system (SS) - in mixed reactors (Dalsenter and Tavares 1999). However, several studies have shown that the biological processes carried out in solid state fermentation (SSF) promote higher enzymatic activity, despite the 
difficult control performance (Palma 2003).
Throughout the production of enzymes by 
basidiomycetes, the SSF system seems quite appro-
priate given the characteristics of the substrate 
involved in the process, which consists essentially 
of lignocellulosic material (Wisniewski et al. 2010). 
Thus, as the SS presents better process conditions, 
the addition of lignocellulosic supplements such 
as cob corn meal has been proposed to stimulate 
the expression of lignolytic enzymes, in particular 
MnP (Boer et al. 2004). Therefore, the corn cob and the presence of lignocellulosic material 
suitable for the development of basidiomycetes are nutritionally adequate for mycelial growth 
(Valadares Filho et al. 2002).
Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the 
expression of MnP by the basidiomycetes Lentinula edodes and Lentinula boryana in SSF, cultivated in 
lignocellulosic biomass of Eucalyptus benthamii, 
and in SS, seeking knowledge on the differences 
between the two systems in order to define the best 
conditions for enzyme express.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
FUNGI AND CuLTIv ATION CONdITIONS
L. edodes (CNPF 21) and L. boryana (CNPF 24) were both maintained on Potato Dextrose 
Agar medium (PDA - prepared according to 
manufacturer's instructions) at 4 °C (called as 
primary matrix). For the production of secondary 
matrix, 7 mm plugs of the primary matrix were 
placed separately in Petri dishes containing PDA 
medium. These plates were incubated in a B.O.d chamber, at 20 °C for L. boryana (Faria et al. 2007) 
and at 25 °C for L. edodes (Regina and Broetto 
2005), in the absence of light, until the complete 
outspreading of the fungus on the plate. After that, 
the matrix was used as inoculum for SS and SSF.
For SS, a modified SOCAREAN medium 
was prepared (Couri and Farias 1995), containing An Acad Bras Cienc (2013) 85 (3)967
MNP BY L. edodes AND L. boryana IN SSF AND SS
3.0 g.L-1 of sodium nitrate p.a. (NaNO 3), 0.5 g.L-1 
of magnesium sulphate p.a. (MgSO 4), 0.5 g.L-1 of 
potassium chloride p.a. (KCl), 0.01 g.L-1 of ferrous 
sulfate heptahydrate p.a. (FeSO 4.7H 2O), 1.0 g.L-1 
of dibasic potassium phosphate p.a. (K 2hPO 4) and 
12.0 g.L-1 of corn cob meal (obtained from Embrapa 
Florestas). The medium (50 mL) was placed into 125 
mL Erlenmeyer flasks and sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. The flasks were inoculated with 6 plugs of the secondary matrix and incubated 
for 30 days in a B.O.d chamber at 20 °C for L. 
boryana and at 25 °C for L. edodes, in the absence 
of light. Four flasks were randomly taken every five 
days for kinetic analysis of cellular growth, glucose 
residual value, pH and MnP activity.
For SSF, two treatments (culture medium) 
were used and both were prepared with sawdust (≤ 3 mm) of Eucalyptus benthamii (obtained 
from Embrapa Florestas). T1 treatment consisted of 95% sawdust and 5% soybean meal. T2 treatment consisted of 75% sawdust, 5% soybean meal, 10% cassava bagasse and 10% corn cob meal. Forty grams (40 g) of the treatments were transferred to 500 mL flasks and 50 mL of distilled water were added to each of them. The flasks were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C 
for 1 hour. The two media were inoculated with 
5 plugs of the secondary matrix and incubated for 30 days in a B.O.d chamber at 20 °C for L. boryana and at 25 °C for L. edodes, in the 
absence of light. Three flasks were randomly taken every five days for kinetic analysis of the moisture content, a
w, pH and MnP activity.
KINETIC ANALYSIS OF SUBMERGED SYSTEM
The fungi mycelium was separated from the culture medium through vacuum filtration and, in order to obtain the enzymatic extract, the medium was 
centrifuged (Hermle refrigerated centrifuge) at 
2,990.65 × g and 4 °C during 15 min. The supernatant (extract) was collected for MnP quantification.To estimate the biomass, the gravimetric method 
of dry weight was used. The mycelium and corn 
cob meal retained on the filter paper, after vacuum 
filtration, were placed in a laboratory oven at 70 °C 
until constant weight was achieved. Mycelium mass 
was calculated by the difference between total mass and corn cob meal mass added to the flask. Therefore, 
cell concentration (Cc) was calculated as the ratio 
between mycelium mass and the medium’s volume.
The average growth rate (Gr) was calculated as 
the ratio between the variation of cell concentration 
and cultivation time. Maximum specific growth 
rate (μ
max) was determined using a linear regression 
of natural logarithm of cell concentration against cultivation time. The slope obtained during 
logarithm phase represented µ
max (Pirt 1967).
The residual glucose concentration in the culture 
medium was determined by spectrophotometry 
(in Shimadzu UV-1650 spectrophotometer) using 
the enzymatic method of glucose oxidase (GOd), 
performed as described by the manufacturer of 
the enzymatic glucose test kit (Doles). The pH 
was directly measured in all samples using the 
potentiometric method (Tecnal pH meter).
KINETIC ANALYSIS OF SOLId STATE FERMENTATION
Humidity (H) was determined by drying the 
substrate samples in a laboratory oven at 70 °C until 
reaching constant weight. The difference between 
wet mass (m W) and dry mass (m D) was calculated 
as shown in Equation 1.
H−mW − mD

Water activity (a w = Pm / Ps) of the medium 
depends on its moisture content and composition as 
it concerns the ratio between the vapor pressure of 
the culture medium (Pm) and the vapor pressure of 
pure water (Ps) at the same temperature (Wenqing 
et al. 2003). In each sample of the SSF, a w was 
determined by direct measurement of substrate 
samples in an Aqualab® device (Decagon).An Acad Bras Cienc (2013) 85 (3)968
KATIA L. HERMANN, ALESSANDRA COSTA, CRISTIANE V . HELM, EDSON A. DE LIMA and LORENA B.B. TA V ARES
To obtain the enzymatic extract from the 
solid medium, it was placed on Erlenmeyer 
flasks, in a ratio of 6 mL of distilled water/gram 
of substrate, and shaken for 3 hours at 20 °C. 
After that, the mixture was vacuum filtered and 
the liquid portion was centrifuged at 2,990.65 × g 
at 4 °C during 15 min. The supernatant (extract) 
was collected for MnP quantification and pH 
direct measurement.
QuANTIFICATION OF MNP  IN THE EXTRACTS
The MnP activity in the extracts obtained from SS 
and SSF was determined through spectrophotometry, 
using the modified method of Wariishi et. al (1992). 
A reaction mixture containing 0.4 mL of extract, 
0.4 mL of maganese sulfate p.a. (MnSO 4) 10 mM, 
2.8 mL of sodium malonate buffer 50 mM, pH 4.5, and 0.4 mL of hydrogen peroxide p.a. (H
2O2) 
0.5 mM was prepared. The oxidation of MnSO4 by h2O2 results in the formation of the complex 
Mn(III)-malonate which was monitored at 30 °C, during 5 min, at 270 nm (ε270=11,590 M-1.cm-1). 
The enzymatic activity (EA) expressed in 
International Unit per liter (UI.L
-1), defined as 
the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μM of substrate per minute per liter of extract was 
calculated by:EA=ΔA 11VR(2)tdεVE
where ΔA/t is the graph slope of absorbance 
variation (ΔA) over reaction time (t), d is the path 
length, ε is the molar extinction coefficient, VR is the 
total reaction volume and V E is the extract volume.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All analyses were performed in triplicate. The results of biomass production, MnP activity, pH, 
moisture and a
w were examined by analysis of 
variance (ANOv A). Means with p-values under 
0.05 were considered statistically different, and, in 
these cases the Tukey´s test was also applied.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
FERMENTATION IN SUBMERGED SYSTEM
Biomass production (expressed by cell concen-tration) and MnP activity analyzed during the SS 
of L. edodes and L. boryana are shown in Figure 
1. It is possible to notice that there were significant differences between the cell concentration means 
of the two species only on the 5th and 25
th day of 
cultivation, indicating that they grow in a similar way, 
although the Gr of L. edodes (0.14 g.L-1.day-1) was 
greater than that of L. boryana (0.08 g.L-1.day-1).

MNP BY L. edodes AND L. boryana IN SSF AND SS
Due to the fact that the cultivation was 
performed in multiple flasks for sample collection, 
the occurrence of oscillations during growth is 
acceptable, such as the peak cell concentration of 
L. edodes on the 15th day followed by a decay of 
biomass, which is not usual in reality. For this reason it was not possible to precisely define the stages of 
fungal growth. The use of natural logarithm made possible to verify the absence of a lag phase. To 
calculate the μmax, the L. boryana logarithmic’s 
phase was defined between 0 and 10 days (reaching 
μmax of 0.05.day-1) and also L. edodes’ between 0 
and 5 days ( μmax of 0.10.day-1) (Figure 2). These 
values confirm what was observed visually during the experiment, that L. edodes presented higher 
mycelial density in a shorter cultivation time.
Fig. 2 - Natural logarithm of cell concentration against cultivation time to obtain the maximum.
After the period of maximum growth the 
system got into a phase of reduction in the rate 
of biomass production (characterized as stationary 
phase), in which secondary metabolism is 
activated, resulting in the production of bioactive 
compounds such as phenol oxidative enzymes. 
Ferreira et al. (2010) states that nutritional stress 
may be one of the responsible factors for MnP 
synthesis, explaining why this enzyme expression 
was observed only after the 15th day (Figure 1). 
Maximum levels of enzyme activity were obtained 
at 25 days of cultivation for both species. For L. 
boryana this value was much higher (70 UI.L-1). 
The values obtained at 30 days for both species. 
The one obtained at 25 days for L. edodes showed 
no statistical difference.
MnP activity expressed by L. edodes in this 
study was lower than the one found in the literature 
for the same fungus. Regina and Broetto (2005) 
obtained maximum values of MnP activity around 
1,400 UI.L-1 for L. edodes grown in liquid media 
composed by an infusion of cassava bagasse and dextrose. However, these authors also observed the influence of substrate on enzyme expression, as in 
an infusion of sugar cane bagasse and dextrose, the 
maximum value obtained was of 400 UI.L
-1.
The SS medium used in this study contained 
corn cob meal which has more than 60% of 
polysaccharides with high concentration of 
xylan, followed by the monosaccharides xylose 
and glucose (R.F.M. Silveira, unpublished data). 
However, the presence of residual glucose during 
the cultivations was not detected, showing that 
this lignocellulosic substrate may not have been 
used by the fungi during its development. Another 
hypothesis is that the low enzymatic activity 
promoted a reduced biodegradation, influencing the low production of sugars for cellular metabolism 
and thus influencing global cellular metabolism.
The medium presented an initial pH near 5.0 
(Table I), but a statistically significant decrease in 
this value after the beginning of both species of 
Lentinula’s growth was observed.
The assays for quantification of MnP use 
buffer with pH 4.5, and then it seems that values 
of pH near this one help in the enzyme stability. An Acad Bras Cienc (2013) 85 (3)970

Although ph has fluctuated throughout the growth 
of fungi, it has remained between 3.6 and 4.6. It 
was noted that for both species, the remarkable 
lower values occurred at 20, and especially at 
25 days; periods at which a greater expression 
of the enzyme was observed. It indicates that the 
biosynthesis of metabolites of this species could 
significantly change the ph in the case of SS, a 
fact that should be better studied.
Analyzing the obtained data, it seems that 
SS presents suitable characteristics for MnP 
production and it is feasible to study its application in the development of second generation ethanol. 
However, considering what was observed in this study, the time required for the occurrence of 
enzyme expression in this system becomes a barrier 
for its application in an industrial process.

Values of a w, pH and moisture concerning SSF 
are presented in Table II. Despite the samplings being performed in periods of 5 days, the values 
mentioned in Table II only correspond to the 
beginning, middle and end of cultivation time. 
Unlike submerged culture, in SSF there was no 
statistical difference in the values of pH throughout 
the cultivation of both species neither between the 
species for the same day.

V .M.C.S Santos (unpublished data) reports 
that some species of basidiomycetes have the 
characteristic of self-regulating pH, tending to stabilize its value in the optimum pH for growth, 
regardless the initial pH value. This fact was also 
observed by Vieira et al. (2008) in a study with An Acad Bras Cienc (2013) 85 (3)971
MNP BY L. edodes AND L. boryana IN SSF AND SS
Polyporus tricoloma for antibiotic production. 
The initial ph value does not seem to influence 
the lengthening of hyphae in Macrocybe titans as 
well. Wisniewski et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of initial pH values (5, 6, 7 and 8) in radial mycelial growth of M. titans in PDA medium. According 
to the author, there was no influence on mycelial 
growth, which can be explained by self-regulation.
Regarding humidity, there were no statistical 
differences between fungi neither throughout cultivation time (Table II). The values remained 
constant until the 15
th day for the L. boryana’s 
culture, being reduced after that by over 15%. 
For the cultivation of L. edodes, in T1 treatment 
values remained constant throughout the whole cultivation, unlike the values of T2 treatment, which have decreased. Concerning the humidity achieved during SSF, the aw values showed no statistically significant differences (Table II).
However, analyzing the data from a 
physiological point of view, it is known that an aw of 0.988 may be different from 1.0, since it is possible to have aw values close to 1.0 with moisture contents between 20 and 100%, which can lead to the verification of different consequences for cell 
growth and enzymes expression.
MnP activity values obtained throughout the 
SSF of fungi is shown in Figure 3. It was realized that 
although the maximum value of fungi’s enzymatic 
activity was very close, around 110 UI.L
-1 (equivalent 
to 0.66 UI.g-1), the enzyme expression occurred at 
different times. For L. edodes the maximum value 
was obtained at 10 days of cultivation, while for 
L. boryana the maximum value was observed 
between 20 and 25 days. It was also noted that the supplementation of culture medium with cassava 
bagasse or corn cob (which made T1 different from 
T2) showed no significant difference for the species of Lentinula. Consequently, the combined addition of 
these carbon sources, in the studied concentrations, did not contribute to increase the production of the 
enzyme MnP.MnP activity showed a decrease in both 
treatments in SSF after reaching the highest activity 
level. This was also reported by Regina (2004), who 
found a significant decreasing in MnP activity after 
the 8
th day of incubation of different L. edodes’ 
strains. According to Kadimaliev (2003), changes 
in lignolytic activity and in peroxidase biosynthesis 
activity by fungi during solid state cultivation, 
depend on the type of substrate used. The author 
states that the amount of substances that restrict the 
mycelium growth (such as resins) and the existence 
of a more intricate supramolecular structure may be 
linked to this outcome.
According to Silva (2004), many basidio-
mycetes are developed in a simple media which 
presents availability of assimilable carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources and essential 
mineral salts. The ability of the fungus to grow 
in lignocellulosic substrates is related to the vigor 
of the inoculated mycelium and to the capacity 
to activate physiological mechanisms necessary 
to use the nutrients from the culture medium 
(Mata et al. 2001). Thus, the nutritional needs 
for a satisfactory mycelium growth, especially at 
the initial stage of cultivation, can be achieved 
depending on the type of material used in culture 
medium supplementation. The addition of certain meals, for example, provides nitrogen sources and 
can stimulate the enzymatic action of mycelium 
(Donini et al. 2006).

However, J.H.A. Betini (unpublished data) 
proved that the fungus Aspergillus niveus produced 
a 30% higher concentration of xylanase when 
grown in a medium containing only wheat bran 
as carbon source, when compared to the medium 
which also contained corncob. This demonstrates 
that supplementation with cob meal does not seem 
to respond satisfactorily to the fungal enzyme 
production, although Kadowaki et al. (1997), in 
their studies, have obtained maximum production 
of xylanase by Aspergillus tamarii when it was 
cultivated in medium supplemented with high concentration of corncob.
CONCLUSION
When considering the two cultivation systems, it seems clear that the process developed in liquid 
medium, apart from presenting a lower enzymatic 
activity, reduced the kinetics of MnP’s production. 
On the other hand, lignocellulosic materials, such as 
eucalyptus wood, proved to be promising for enzymes 
production by basidiomycetes, for their stimulation 
capacity of MnP expression. Thus, considering the 
importance of eucalyptus in the energy matrix to 
obtain bioethanol, studies on how to optimize the 
production processes of enzymes able to degrade 
lignocellulolytic compounds should be encouraged.

RESUMO
A produção de etanol a partir de biomassa lignoce-
lulósica é referida como uma segunda geração de biocombustíveis, sendo que este processo é uma das mais promissoras tecnologias em fase de desenvolvimento. 
Poucas são as pesquisas disponíveis sobre o uso de enzimas 
produzidas por fungos como ativos para biodegradação de biomassa lignocelulósica. No entanto, a enzima manganês 
peroxidase (MnP) apresenta alto potencial para degradar 
a lignina e os fungos basidiomicetos são os principais 
produtores desta oxidase. Portanto, esse estudo teve por 
objetivo avaliar a capacidade dos fungos Lentinula edodes  
e Lentinula boryana em produzir essa enzima quando 
cultivados em fermentação em sistema submerso (FSS) e também em fermentação em sistema sólido (FES) 
contendo serragem de Eucalyptus benthamii suplementada 
ou não com farelo de sabugo de milho. Na FSS, a maior expressão de MnP ocorreu no 25° dia de cultivo, sendo 70 
UI.L
-1 para L. boryana e 20 UI.L-1 para L. edodes. Na FES, 
os melhores resultados foram obtidos no 10º dia para L. edodes, enquanto que para L. boryana foram entre o 20° e 
o 25° dia, apesar de ambas as espécies terem apresentado valores próximos a 110 UI.L
-1. Portanto, os resultados 
indicaram que os fungos estudados expressam a enzima de interesse e que a sua produção é otimizada quando 
cultivados em sistema sólido.
