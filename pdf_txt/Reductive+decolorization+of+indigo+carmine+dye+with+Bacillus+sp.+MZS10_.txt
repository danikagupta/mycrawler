Textile dyes are the main pollutants in the textile and 
dyeing industry’s wastewater. Approximately 5%–10% 
of the dyes used are released into the environment 
with wastewater, and the colored wastewater negatively 
affects photosynthetic activity and dissolved oxygen 
concentration in water bodies into which it is released. 
Therefore, the decolorization of this type of wastewater 
is generally more important than the remediation of the 
other colorless organic substances (Banat et al., 1996; 
Wong and Yu, 1999). Generally, textile dyes are highly 
recalcitrant to biological degradation. Thus, textile and 
dyeing industry wastewater is not effectively decolorized 
by conventional biological treatment systems such as 
activated sludge systems. There have been many studies 
on decolorization of wastewater containing dyes using 
various methods and biological systems (Y esilada et al., 
2003; Barka et al., 2008; Ramya et al., 2008; Manivannan 
et al., 2011).
Wastewater with dyes may be decolorized using 
various biological systems such as fungi, enzymes, and 
bacteria (Campos et al., 2001; Y esilada et al., 2010; Kalyani 
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Y eşilada et al., 2014a). Indigo dye (C.I. 73015 Acid Blue 74) is used to dye denim fabric 
(Ramya et al., 2008). Its toxicity has also been reported 
(Barka et al., 2008). Because it is recalcitrant to activated 
sludge system decolorization, high amounts of indigo dye 
are released into rivers and lakes with wastewater. Due to 
its negative effects, it must be decolorized using ecofriendly 
methods. Bacterial, fungal, and enzymatic decolorization 
of indigo carmine has also been reported (Barka et al., 
2008; Ramya et al., 2008; Birhanli and Y esilada, 2010; 
Terres et al., 2014). The dye decolorization performance 
of bacteria and laccase enzymes are different and they 
need different optimum decolorization conditions for 
optimum levels of decolorization. Although there have 
been several studies on decolorization activity of bacteria 
and laccase enzyme, based on our literature knowledge, 
there have been no studies that focus on the comparison 
of indigo dye decolorization using a bacterium and crude 
laccase enzyme from white rot fungus Funalia (Trametes ) 
trogii ATCC 200800. Therefore, in this study, the indigo 
dye decolorization activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
and the crude laccase obtained from the white rot fungus 
Funalia trogii  ATCC 200800 under the effects of various 
culture conditions was comparatively investigated. Abstract: The effects of incubation time, temperature, initial pH, and dye concentration on the indigo carmine decolorization activity 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and some factors on the decolorization potential of crude laccase enzyme obtained from 
Funalia trogii  ATCC 200800 were comparatively investigated. This bacterium showed effective decolorization activity at all agitation and 
temperature values. Indigo carmine was greatly decolorized by P . aeruginosa  at all pH values except pH 10. A decrease in decolorization 
activity occurred with increasing dye concentration, but this bacterium effectively decolorized the dye within 24 h. The decolorization 
process was through microbial metabolism, not biosorption. No decolorization or laccase activity could be obtained by the cell-free 
intracellular extract or culture filtrate of this bacterium. On the other hand, crude laccase effectively decolorized indigo carmine under 
highly acidic conditions, especially at pH 3.0 as 57% in 300 seconds. This activity decreased progressively due to the increase in pH 
values. In a short incubation period and at high temperature values, the crude laccase enzyme removed the color of the dye at 50 °C 
(56%), 60 °C (45%), and 70 °C (38%). These data are important for improving methods for decolorization of textile dyes used at high 
temperatures in various industrial applications.

BORAN et al. / Turk J Biol382. Materials and methods
2.1. Textile dye
Indigo carmine (Acid blue 74) was prepared as a stock 
solution of 1000 mg/L by dissolving in distilled water and 
utilized at various concentrations (50–500 mg/L).
2.2. Bacterium and culture conditions 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ATCC 10145 was tested for 
its dye decolorization activity. This bacterium was first 
incubated at 30 °C on Luria agar (LA) plates. A loopful 
of P . aeruginosa  culture was then inoculated into 20 mL 
Luria broth (LB)/100 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated 
at 30 °C and 150 rpm. After incubation, an aliquot of 1 
mL overnight culture was inoculated into a 100-mL flask 
containing 20 mL of LB and cultured at 30 °C and 150 rpm 
for 24 h of incubation. As the final step, 1 mL of this culture 
was transferred into 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL 
LB containing textile dye.
The effects of agitation, temperature, pH, dye 
concentration, and culture period on the indigo carmine 
decolorization ability of P . aeruginosa  was studied. Unless 
otherwise stated, the agitation and temperature values were 
150 rpm and 30 °C, respectively. Flasks containing only 
dye and medium but no bacteria were used as controls.
2.3. Bacterial decolorization studies
The effect of incubation time on the dye decolorization 
activity of P . aeruginosa  was tested for 2, 4, and 6 h under 
static and shaking (150 rpm) conditions. The effect of 
pH on decolorization was tested within the pH range of 
5.0–10.0. Dye decolorization potential of the bacterium 
was tested under static and various agitated conditions 
at 50–200 rpm after 4 h incubation. In order to detect 
the effect of incubation temperature on decolorization 
activity, different temperature values (20–50 °C) were 
used. To test the effects of initial dye concentration, the 
bacterium was treated with the dye solutions of 100–500 
mg/L concentrations for 4, 8, and 24 h.
2.4. Live and dead bacterial pellet studies
The dye decolorization potential of live and dead microbial 
pellets was also compared. To examine the decolorization 
activity of live and dead P . aeruginosa  pellets, P . aeruginosa  
was cultivated in LB without indigo carmine dye as stated 
above; the culture was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm. After 
centrifugation, the pellets were autoclaved at 121 °C for 
half an hour for preparation of dead pellets. Live pellets 
were also prepared in the same manner, but without 
autoclavization. The prepared dead and live pellets were 
added separately into 50 mL LB containing 50 and 100 
mg/L indigo carmine dye and incubated for 4 h. 
2.5. Dye decolorization activity of cell-free culture fil-
trate and cell-free intracellular extract of the bacterium
To test if the decolorization activity was from cell-free 
culture broth, P . aeruginosa culture filtrate obtained after indigo carmine dye decolorization for 4 h was used. This 
decolorized culture broth was filtered with a sterilized 
membrane of 0.45-mm pore size, and then 50 mg/L indigo 
carmine (at final concentration) was added to this cell-free 
culture filtrate and incubated at 30 °C and 150 rpm for 4 h. 
To determine if this bacterial dye decolorization activity 
was from cell-free intracellular extract, 4 mL phosphate 
buffer (pH 4.0) was added to the bacterial pellets from an 
overnight culture centrifuged at 6000 rpm, and sonicated 
with an ultrasonic processor. The cell-free intracellular 
extract was then obtained by centrifugation at 10000 ×g 
and 4 °C for 10 min. 
The presence of laccase enzyme activity in the cell-
free culture filtrate and cell-free intracellular extract was 
also investigated. The laccase production ability of this 
bacterium was also screened by using a nutrient agar 
plate containing 0.5 mM ABTS. This plate was incubated 
at 30 °C for 48 h after inoculation from the P . aeruginosa  
overnight culture. The oxidation of ABTS indicates laccase 
production. 
2.6. Crude laccase enzyme production by Funalia trogii
The preinoculum was obtained by incubating the 
mycelium of Funalia trogii  ATCC 200800 in 100 mL of 
Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at 30 °C and 150 rpm 
for 5 days. The formed preinoculum was homogenized, 
and 7 mL of this homogenate was transferred to 600 mL 
of fresh SDB and then incubated for 5 days. The obtained 
pellets were used for the production of laccase enzyme 
with the repeated-batch method. During this process, 
50 mL of the stock basal medium (SBM) were added 
to the pellets and they were incubated for 24 h under 
agitated conditions. The composition of SBM utilized 
was (g/L): KH2PO4, 0.2; CaCl2.2H2O, 0.1; MgSO4.7H2O, 
0.05; NH4H2PO4, 0.5; FeSO4.7H2O, 0.035; glucose, 2; yeast 
extract, 1; CuSO4.5H2O, 0.125. Every 24 h for 5 days, 
SBM was completely removed and fresh medium added 
to the filtered pellets (Birhanli and Y esilada, 2010). The 
culture filtrate from the 5 days of incubation was used 
as the source of crude laccase for color removal studies. 
The crude laccase was added into the solution containing 
indigo carmine (100 mg/L) and citrate phosphate buffer 
and incubated for 30, 60, and 300 s. The impact of pH, 
incubation temperature, and amounts of crude enzyme on 
dye decolorization was tested for all incubation times as 
mentioned above. Unless otherwise stated, the incubation 
temperature, dye, and amount of crude enzyme were 30 
°C, 100 mg/L, and 100 µL, respectively.
2.7. Decolorization studies with the crude laccase en-
zyme from F. trogii
The effect of pH on decolorization was tested within the 
pH range of 2.5–6.0 for crude laccase. Citrate phosphate 
buffer was used for adjusting the pH values of the reaction 
mixtures. A temperature range of 30–70 °C was used for BORAN et al. / Turk J Biol39testing the dye decolorization activity of the crude laccase 
at pH 3.0. Different amounts (10–200 µL) of crude laccase 
enzyme were used to detect the impact of the enzyme 
amount on dye decolorization. All of the decolorization 
studies with crude fungal laccase were carried out at 100 
mg/L dye concentration and 150 rpm.
2.8. Assays
Dye decolorization was calculated by monitoring 
the absorbance changes at the maximum absorbance 
wavelengths (610 nm) of indigo carmine. The decolorization 
values were expressed in terms of percentage.
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) activity was determined by 
measuring the increase in absorbance of ABTS [2,2′-Azino-
bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] at 420 nm 
(Y esilada et al., 2014b). The assay mixture contained 
100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.5 mM ABTS, 
suitable amounts of cell-free culture filtrate and cell-free 
intracellular extract of the bacterium, and culture filtrate 
of F. trogii (Birhanli and Y esilada, 2006; Birhanli et al., 
2013). All values are the means of at least 3 replicates.
3. Results and discussion
3.1.  Dye decolorization by P . aeruginosa
Because physical and chemical methods have various 
disadvantages for dye removal, various bacteria, as 
biological systems, have been studied for the decolorization 
of textile dyes such as indigo carmine (Table 1).3.1.1. The effect of incubation time on biodecolorization 
To test the effect of incubation time on biodecolorization 
of indigo carmine dye, the bacterium was incubated in 50 
mg/L dye-containing medium under static and agitated 
(150 rpm) conditions for 6 h. The bacterium showed 
rapid decolorization activity; it effectively decolorized 
this dye after 4 h of incubation. The decolorization value 
was not significantly changed after this time (Figure 
1). Therefore, incubation for 4 h was determined as a 
sufficient incubation period for testing the indigo carmine 
dye decolorization activity of this bacterium. Chen et al. 
(2003) used 6 different isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila  
for decolorization of indigo carmine dye at 100 mg/mL 
concentration. The maximum decolorization activity 
was obtained in the first tested isolate as 60% and 84% 
at the first and seventh days of incubation, respectively. 
Decolorization of indigo carmine (50 mg/L) under static 
and agitated conditions is shown in Figure 2.
3.1.2. The effect of agitation on biodecolorization
Agitation is an important factor for high decolorization 
activity. Therefore, the effect of agitation on the dye 
decolorization ability of P . aeruginosa  was also investigated. 
To this end, dye decolorization ability of the bacterium 
was tested under static and various agitated conditions. 
This bacterium effectively decolorized this dye at all 
agitation rates after 4 h of incubation (Figure 3). Ramya et 
al. (2008) reported low indigo dye decolorization activity

to shaken cultures. Similarly, free cells of Pseudomonas 
luteola  were reported as very sensitive to dissolved oxygen 
during reactive red 22 dye decolorization (Chang et al., 
2001). This difference may come from the different species 
used. 
3.1.3. The effect of temperature on biodecolorization
Decolorization of indigo carmine dye was carried out at 
various temperatures (20–50 °C) at 150 rpm for 4 h. Figure 
4 shows that P . aeruginosa  decolorized this dye efficiently 
at all of the temperatures tested. This showed that dye 
decolorization activity of P . aeruginosa  is independent 
of temperature changes. Ramya et al. (2008) reported 
low indigo dye decolorization activity of bacterium 
Paenibacillus larvae  at a temperature of 20 °C. The indigo 
carmine decolorization capacity of this strain under a broad range of temperatures shows that this strain could 
be effectively used in dye decolorization. Jaiswal et al. 
(2014) investigated various reaction parameters such as 
incubation temperature (20, 33, and 37 °C), pH (5.0–10.0), 
and incubation time (24–96 h) in order to find the highest 
decolorization rate of indigo carmine (100 mg/L) using 
Bacillus  sp. The maximum decolorization activity was 
observed as about 67% at pH 6.0 and 37 °C under agitated 
conditions (120 rpm) in the 96th h.
3.1.4. The effect of pH on biodecolorization
The pH of the medium may affect the dye decolorization 
activity of bacteria (Hsueh and Chen, 2007). Therefore, 
the effect of pH on the dye decolorization activity of this 
bacterium was also investigated at different initial pH 
values (150 rpm and 30 °C). As shown in Figure 5, this

mg/L) decolorization activity of P . aeruginosa .Figure 2. Indigo carmine (50 mg/L) decolorization of P.  
aeruginosa  after 4 h of incubation under static and agitated 
conditions. 
Figure 3. Effect of agitation on indigo carmine dye (50 mg/L) decolorization 
activity of P . aeruginosa .BORAN et al. / Turk J Biol41bacterium could highly decolorize this dye at all pH 
values except pH 10.0. This bacterium could be used to 
decolorize dye wastewater of acidic, neutral, and basic 
types. The decolorization of dyes at a wide range of pH 
values is a desirable characteristic (Kalyani et al., 2012). 
Ramya et al. (2008) reported low indigo dye decolorization 
activity (6%–15%) of bacterium Paenibacillus larvae  at pH 
3.0, while the maximum decolorization activity was at pH 
7.0 and 8.0.
3.1.5. The effect of initial dye concentration on biodecol-
orization
Indigo carmine decolorization activity of P . aeruginosa  
was also tested for different initial dye concentrations 
(100–500 mg/L) at 30 °C and 150 rpm. An increase in 
dye concentration negatively affected short-duration 
decolorization activity, and dye decolorization activity of this bacterium decreased with increasing dye 
concentration. However, the bacterium recovered its 
decolorization activity for longer incubation times. 
Therefore, high dye concentrations were not toxic to P.  
aeruginosa.  Similar results were reported by Ramya et 
al. (2008). P . aeruginosa  effectively decolorized this dye 
within 24 h at all concentrations used (Figure 6). Controls 
containing dyes but with no cells showed no change in 
color.
3.1.6. Indigo carmine dye decolorization under static 
and agitated conditions
The dye decolorization activity of this bacterium was 
compared under static and agitated conditions over 
the course of 6 h. The dye decolorization activity was 
studied at pH 6.0, dye concentration of 50 mg/L, and 2 
different temperatures (30 and 40 °C). The observed dye

Figure 5. Effect of pH on indigo carmine dye (50 mg/L) decolorization activity 
of P . aeruginosa .BORAN et al. / Turk J Biol42decolorization activity of this bacterium under static and 
agitated conditions was quite high (Table 2). 
3.1.7. Indigo carmine dye decolorization activity of dead 
and live pellets of P . aeruginosa
Biodecolorization is due to either adsorption or 
biodegradative decolorization. Therefore, the indigo 
carmine dye decolorization ability of dead and live pellets 
of P . aeruginosa  was also compared to prove that the dye 
decolorization activity is from metabolic activity of this 
bacterium, and not from adsorption. This decolorization 
activity was tested for 2 different dye concentrations (50 
mg/L and 100 mg/L) at 30 °C and 150 rpm. While the dead 
pellets decolorized 20%–27% of the dye, live pellets rapidly 
decolorized 91%–92% of the dye without any visible 
adsorption (Table 3). Therefore, the high percentage of dye 
decolorization is mainly due to bacterial metabolism, not 
adsorption. This result is similar to those observed with 
other Pseudomonas  strains (Yu et al., 2001). Malachite 
green dye decolorization activity of the P . aeruginosa  NCIM 2074 strain was attributed to biodegradation and 
not adsorption (Kalyani et al., 2012). 
3.1.8. Dye decolorization activity of cell-free intracellu-
lar extract and culture filtrate
It is possible to decolorize the dyes by using cell-free 
intracellular extract or extracellular culture filtrates of 
various organisms (Y eşilada et al., 2014a). Therefore, the 
decolorization activity of cell-free intracellular extract and 
culture filtrate was also tested. However, in this study, no 
decolorization could be obtained with either the cell-free 
intracellular extract or culture filtrate of this bacterium. 
Kuddus et al. (2013) reported the textile dye decolorization 
ability of culture filtrate of P . putida .
The laccase enzymes from fungi or bacteria have dye 
decolorization activity (Reiss et al., 2011). The indigo 
dye decolorization activity of laccase from bacteria has 
also been reported (Cho et al., 2011; Reiss et al., 2011). 
Therefore, the laccase production ability of this bacterium 
was screened by using nutrient agar plate containing 0.5

decolorization activity of P . aeruginosa .

colored oxidation product can be seen macroscopically if 
this bacterium produces this enzyme. Absence of oxidation 
indicated that there was no laccase production. After this 
preliminary study, we assayed the laccase activity of cell-
free intracellular extract and extracellular culture filtrate 
spectrophotometrically. No laccase activity was detected. 
Yu et al. (2001) reported a nonspecific decomposition 
mechanism for decolorization of indigo carmine by 
Pseudomonas  strains.
3.2. Dye decolorization by crude laccase
Laccase, an ecofriendly enzyme, can be used for various 
industrial applications. But it is important that the 
production of this enzyme produces large amounts and be cost effective. This enzyme may be synthesized by different 
fermentation processes such as submerged and solid-
state fermentation. The repeated-batch mode, a different 
method from the others stated above, was used in this study. 
Large amounts of laccase were extracellularly synthesized 
with this method, which used the pellet forms of F. trogii. 
White rot fungal laccases could decolorize textile dyes 
such as indigo carmine (Table 4). Therefore, the crude 
laccase obtained here was used for the decolorization of 
the commonly used textile dye indigo carmine. 
3.2.1. The effect of pH on biodecolorization
The reaction pH is an important parameter for dye 
decolorization by enzyme. For this aim, different pH 
values (2.5–6.0) were investigated at 30, 60, and 300

pH value for high decolorization of indigo carmine by 
crude laccase. Decolorization of indigo carmine dye at 
100 mg/L concentration was carried out at 150 rpm and 
30 °C. The differences in dye decolorization of fungal 
laccase depending on the various pH values are presented 
in Table 5. Some researchers have reported acidic pH 
values as the optimum pH values for fungal laccases 
in dye decolorization studies (Li et al., 2014). In a study 
conducted by Li et al. (2014), indigo carmine dye at 100 
mg/L was decolorized at a rate of 99% by crude laccase 
of Trametes  sp. SYBC-L4 at an optimum pH of 4.5 within 
36 h. Similarly, pH 3.0 was determined as the optimum 
pH for the decolorization of indigo carmine in this study. 
While indigo carmine was enzymatically decolorized at 
approximately 57% at pH 3.0, the decolorization activity 
was sharply decreased to 7% at pH 6.0 over 300 s. 
3.2.2. The effect of temperature on biodecolorization
Temperature is a critical parameter for laccase 
activity (Y esilada et al., 2014b) and also for enzymatic 
decolorization of the textile dye (Y eşilada et al., 2014a). 
The decolorization studies at various temperature values 
between 30 and 70 °C at pH 3.0 gave high decolorization 
activities. The decolorization values detected at 60 °C 
and pH 3.0 were 12% and 45% after 30 s and 300 s of 
incubation, respectively. However, 38% of the color of this 
dye could be removed at 70 °C and pH 3.0 (Figure 7). In a 
study performed by Claus et al. (2002), laccases obtained 
from Myceliophthora thermophila , Polyporus pinisitus , and 
Trametes versicolor  decolorized the indigo carmine dye (20 
mg/L) at 15%, 90%, and 88% rates respectively at 30 °C and 
pH 5.5 after 16 h incubation.
3.2.3. The effect of enzyme amount on biodecolorization
The crude laccase (54 U/mL) was utilized to investigate the 
effect of different amounts of enzyme on indigo carmine biodecolorization. According to the data obtained, the 
decolorization activity gradually increased with the 
enzyme amount apart from with 200 µL. As shown in 
Figure 8, 100 µL was determined as the optimum amount 
for dye decolorization at pH 3.0.
3.3. Conclusion
Indigo carmine is among the most used dyes in textile 
industry. This dye was greatly decolorized by the bacterium 
culture used in this study. However, the cell-free intracellular 
extract or culture filtrate showed no decolorization activity 
alone. Live pellets rapidly decolorized 91%–92% of the dye 
but dead pellets decolorized only 20%–27%. This shows that 
dye decolorization is mainly due to bacterial metabolism. 
The decolorization of indigo carmine dye by this 
bacterium was not strongly dependent on the conditions 
tested. Therefore, this strain could be used to treat textile 
wastewaters containing indigo dyes. In this work, this 
dye was also decolorized by crude laccase of F. trogii to Table 5. The effect of different pH values on decolorization of

This crude laccase displayed good decolorization activity 
over short incubation times, especially at acidic pH 
values without any mediator. Because some mediators are 
toxic and expensive, decolorization of the dyes without 
any mediator may be an ecofriendly and cost-effective 
method. While the crude laccase decolorized the most 
dye at pH 3, the bacterium decolorized at all pH values 
from pH 5 to pH 10. This study showed that bacteria and crude laccase enzyme from fungi should be selected 
according to the dye type, pH of the wastewater, and type 
of application. According to the literature, this is the first 
comparative study on the commonly used textile dye 
indigo carmine decolorization activity of this bacterium 
and crude laccase enzyme obtained from F. trogii ATCC 
200800. Decolorization processes using bacterial cultures 
and/or laccase enzyme could be helpful in eliminating 
environmental pollution due to textile dyes.
