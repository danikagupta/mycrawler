CitrobacterABSTRACT 
Azo dyes constitute around 70% of the total dyes in the world. Almost 10%–15% of dye is released in 
wastewater during manufacture of the dye and its application, and is a prime source of pollution. Various 
physiochemical methods available for their decolorization have some or the other disadvantages like cost or 
time inefficiency. Hence, bacterial decolorization has been studied for cheap and efficient decolorization. In 
this study, Citrobacter sp. strain EBT-2 was isolated from a textile industry dumping site and used to optimize 
dye decolorization conditions for three Azodyes: methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR), and Eriochrome 
Black T (EBT). Decolorization was measured by UV–Vis spectroscopy analysis. The strain showed 100% 
decolorization for all the three dyes up to 100 mg/l concentration in 96–120 hours. It was able to decolorize 
till 300, 500, and 500 mg/l of dye concentration for MO, CR, and EBT, respectively. Decolorization efficiency 
was independent of initial dye concentration. Optimum pH for decolorization was 7, 7, and 9 for MO, CR, 
and EBT, respectively. The effect of agitation on decolorization was studied under static and agitated (200 
rpm) condition. About 90% decolorization was observed at static condition and about 20% decolorization was 
observed under agitated condition in all the three dyes in 96 hours. Complete decolorization was obtained for 
MO and EBT at 35°C and 45°C, respectively. CR showed complete decolorization only at 35°C. The results 
conclude that Citrobacter sp. can be used for the successful dye decolorization of Azo dyes, primarily MO, CR, 
and EBT under optimum physiochemical conditions.
1. INTRODUCTION
Azo dyes constitute around 60%–70% of dyes synthesized globally 
[1,2]. These are characterized by the presence of one or more azo 
groups, −N=N− [3]. These further consist of phenyl and naphthyl 
groups modified with various functional groups [3]. Such complex 
modifications in their structure makes them xenobiotic in nature 
and highly resistive to breakdown [4]. They are resistant to light, 
washing, chemical and microbial attack, easy to synthesis with 
low energy, and low-cost consumption [4–6]. They are extensively 
used in textile, paper, food, leather, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical 
industries [7]. Almost 10%–15% of dye is released in wastewater 
during its manufacture and application in various industries [8]. 
Contaminants generated by azo dyes constitute of dye particles and 
their breakdown products; primarily amines that are proven to be toxic and mutagenic [9,10]. They also degrade the water quality 
by increasing its biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen 
demand [11,12]. Many reports indicate that textile dyes and effluents 
have toxic effect on the germination rates and biomass of several 
plant species [11,13]. Azo dyes like tartrazine and carmoisine affect 
the functioning of vital organs like kidney and liver in rats and also 
induce the formation of free radicals leading to oxidative stress [14].
Various physiochemical methods like membrane filtration, 
adsorption on activated carbon, flocculation, electro coagulation, 
ozonation, froth floatation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange 
are currently implied for azo dye decolorization. However, these 
methods have limitations like high cost, high energy input, and 
sludge generation [15]. Recently microorganisms have been 
shown to decolorize azo dyes in a cost effective and environment 
friendly manner [16]. Bacteria, algae, fungi, and yeast have 
shown cost effective and eco-friendly degradation of textile dyes 
[11]. Furthermore, versatility in microbial structure makes their 
exploitation easy for decolorization of most of the dyes [17]. Dye *Corresponding Author

decolorization by higher order organisms like fungi is a slow 
process due to the slow growth of the organism [18]. Bacteria on 
the other hand have emerged as a very promising category for dye 
decolorization [19]. They proliferate rapidly under both aerobic 
and anaerobic condition thus can achieve dye degradation at a 
faster rate [20]. They primarily decolorize dyes under anaerobic 
conditions [21]. Few bacteria have been reported to decolorize azo 
dyes in aerobic conditions as well [21]. It has also been shown that 
under a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic conditions, complete 
degradation of some dyes can be achieved [22]. Often textile waste 
waters have high metal content and salinity; hence, it is important 
to utilize microorganisms tolerant to extreme environment 
conditions. Bacterial species like Enterococcus faecalis  and C. 
bufermentas  have been identified as highly halotolerant azo dye 
degrading microorganisms [23]. 
This study was done to isolate and identify a bacterial strain capable 
of decolorizing three azo dyes: methyl orange (MO), congo red 
(CR), and Eriochrome Black T. MO is an acid class single azo dye 
and was found to be mutagenic in a Salmonella/microsome assay 
[24]. CR is a benzidine-based anionic diazo dye and has been 
shown to metabolize to benzidine, a known human carcinogen 
[25]. Eriochrome Black T (EBT) is a single azo naphthol derived 
azo dye and is known to be recalcitrant to oxidative biodegradation 
[26]. Various physiochemical parameters like temperature and pH 
were also optimized for efficient decolorization of dyes. 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Isolation, Screening, and Identification
Soil sample was collected in a sterile glass container from 
dumping site of textile industry located in Bada Bagh Industrial 
area, New Delhi. Samples were serially diluted 105 times and 
were enriched in Luria broth (LB) amended separately with 100 
mg/l of MO, CR, and Eriochrome Black Tat 37°C for 48 hours. 
Subsequent transfers of 1 ml of the culture were carried out in fresh media amended with dye (100 mg/l) till decolorization of 
the media was observed. Decolorized samples were serially 
diluted 107 times and were spread on petri plates with 100 mg/l 
dye concentration. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. 
Morphologically distinct colonies with zone of decolorization 
were screened for their decolorizing ability in media supplied with 
dye (100 mg/l). Out of all the colonies observed on plate, EBT-2 
strain showed the best decolorization zone and hence was picked 
up for further experiments. EBT-2 strain was identified using 16s 
rDNA sequencing and similarity search was conducted against 
database through BLASTn for 16s rDNA. MEGA 4.0 software 
was used to conduct evolutionary analysis by Neighbour Joining 
method [27]. Biochemical characteristics of EBT-2 strain were 
also assessed according to Bergey’s Manual of Determinative 
Bacteriology [28].
2.2. Effect of Initial Dye Concentration on Dye Decolorization
The effect of initial dye concentration on dye decolorizing potential 
of EBT-2 strain was measured by studying decolorization at 
different initial concentrations of MO, CR and Eriochrome Black 
T (10–500 mg/l). LB media was amended with dye concentrations 
ranging from 10 to 500 mg/l and inoculated with 1% EBT-2 
isolate (OD 0.8–1). It was incubated at 37° for 16 hours under 
static condition. Samples were centrifuged at every 24-hour 
interval at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatant was collected 
and absorbance was measured at absorbance peak of each dye 
i.e., 480, 492, and 535 nm for MO, CR, and EBT respectively. 
Decolorization efficiency was measured for a period of 120 hours 
in terms of percentage decolorization [29].
% Decolorization = [(Initial absorbance – Observed absorbance)/ 
Initial absorbance] × 100
The experiment was done thrice, and data was represented as the 
mean ± Standard error of mean. Abiotic controls were always 
included.
2.3. Effect of pH on Dye Decolorization
Decolorization efficiency of EBT-2 strain was studied at different 
pH values. LB containing MO, CR and EBT at the concentration 
of 100 mg/l was inoculated with 1% inoculum and pH was set 
from 5 to 11 (with increment of 1 pH unit). pH was adjusted with 
0.1 N HCL or 0.1 N NaOH. The test was conducted under static 
condition at 37°C for a period of 96 hours and decolorization was 
measured for every 24-hour interval. 
2.4. Effect of Agitation on Dye Decolorization
Effect of agitation on decolorization was checked at 37°C under 
static and agitated state (200 rpm) for MO, CR, and EBT. Dye 
concentration was 100 mg/l, and the study was carried out for 96 
hours with decolorization percentage measured for every24-hour 
interval. 
2.5. Effect of Temperature on Dye Decolorization
100 mg/l dye containing LB media was incubated at 25°C, 35°C, 
45°C, and 55°C at pH 7 to study the effect of temperature on dye Diagrammatic representation of Methodology

decolourization. The test was conducted under static condition and 
decolourization was measured at every 24-hour interval for 96-
hour duration.
3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Isolation, Screening, and Identification
EBT-2 strain was identified as Citrobacter sp. on basis of 
morphological, biochemical ( Table 1 ), and 16s rDNA sequencing 
(Fig. 1 ). It matched 86% identity with Citrobacter sp. and fell in 
the cluster of Klebsiella sp. 
3.2. Effect of Initial Dye Concentration on Dye Decolorization
The isolate was able to decolorize MO up to 300 mg/l ( Fig. 2a–c ) 
and both CR and EBT up to 500 mg/l dye concentration ( Figs. 3a–c and 4a–c ). Contrary to results shown by previous works [18,30], 
dye decolorization did not show a gradual decreasing pattern with 
increase in its initial concentration. It remained independent of 
dye concentration and drastically fell to ~50% for 300–500 mg/l 
dye concentration. It has been also shown that Acid Red dye 
decolorization by Acinetobacter radioresistens is independent of 
its concentration [31]. A probable reason for this observation can 
be extracellular reduction of dye, the rate of which is independent 
of its concentration [32]. The decrease in decolorization efficiency 
beyond 100 mg/l may occur due to several reasons like the toxicity 
of the dye to bacteria and/or insufficient biomass concentration for 
the uptake of higher concentrations of dye [33].
3.3. Effect of Agitation on Dye Decolorization
MO showed 98% decolorization in 96 hours but could only 
achieve 10% decolorization under agitated condition for the 
same time period ( Fig. 5a ). Similar trend was observed for CR, 
it showed 95% decolorization in static and 18% decolorization 
in shaking condition in 96 hours ( Fig. 5b ). Eriochrome Black 
T showed 90% decolorization in static and 35% decolorization 
in shaking condition for the same time period ( Fig. 5c ). Dye 
decolorization was reduced significantly in shaking condition 
as compared to static condition. This agrees with the results 
previously demonstrated studies [34,35]. A possible cause for this 
trend could be that in many bacteria, degradation of azo dyes to 
their corresponding amines occurs due to reduction of azo linkage 
with the aid of cytoplasm azoreductase enzyme. Azoreductase 
mediated degradation of azo dyes is inhibited by the presence of 
oxygen because oxygen is a preferable terminal electron acceptor 
over the azo groups for the oxidation of reduced electron carriers Table 1: Phenotypic and Biochemical characters of EBT-2 strain.

such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide - hydrogen (reduced) 
[22,36].
3.4. Effect of pH on Decolorization
MO and CR showed maximum decolorization at pH 7 in 
96 hours (97.24% and 95.23%, respectively) ( Fig. 6a,b ). Maximum decolorization was observed in a range of pH 7–9 
(~85%) for Eriochrome Black T ( Fig. 6c ). Dye decolorization 
decreased at lower pH (5–6) and very high pH (10–11). It was 
observed that in general, azo dye show better decolorization 
from neutral to alkaline conditions. Similar results were 
observed for decolorization of several azo dyes by Micrococcus  
sp. [37]. Since alkaline environment is required for binding Figure 3:  (a): Effect of dye concentration on dye decolorization (CR; 10–50 
mg/l). (b): Effect of dye concentration on dye decolorization (CR; 60–100 mg/l).

of most azo dyes to fibers, dye degrading bacteria are better 
adapted to alkaline environment [38]. However, the dye 
degradation pattern for all the dyes treated with EBT-2 strain 
are different from each other, which prove that degradation 
is dependent on the chemical structure and reactivity of dyes 
as well. 3.5. Effect of Temperature on Dye Decolorization
EBT-2 completely decolorized MO at both 35°C and 45°C in 120 
hours ( Fig. 7a ). It also decolorized EBT completely at both 35°C 
and 45°C. However, decolorization at 45°C was achieved much 
faster, i.e., in 72 hours as compared to 120 hours at 35°C ( Fig. 
7c). It decolorized CR completely only at 35°C in 120 hours ( Fig. 
7b). For all the three dyes, decolorization efficiency increased Figure 4:  (a) Effect of dye concentration on dye decolorization (EBT: 10–50

with increase in temperature from 25°C to 35–45°C. This is in 
accordance with results previously given for decolorization of 
Acid Orange by Staphylococcus hominis  and decolorization of 
azo dyes by Micrococcus  sp. [30,37,39]. Increase in temperature 
can increase bacterial growth hence increasing decolorization efficiency [19]. No decolorization was observed at 55°C for 
all three dyes which can be caused due to loss of Azoreductase 
enzymatic activity at high temperature or decrease in cell viability 
[39].
4. CONCLUSION
EBT-2 strain was identified as Citrobacter sp. It showed 
complete decolorization of all the three dyes up to 100 mg/l dye Figure 7:  (a) Effect of temperature on dye decolorization (MO; 100 mg/l)

concentration in 96–120 hours. It was able to decolorize MO, 
CR, and EBT up to 300, 500, and 500 mg/l of dye concentration, 
respectively. Optimum pH for decolorization was 7, 7, and 9 for 
MO, CR, and EBT, respectively. Similar results were observed for 
decolorization of several azo dyes by Micrococcus  sp. [37]. Effect 
of agitation on decolorization was studied under static and shaking 
(200 rpm) condition. More than 90% decolorization was observed 
at static condition for each dye but only 10.3%, 18.47% and 
35.92% decolorization was observed at shaking condition in MO, 
CR, and EBT respectively in 96 hours. This agrees with the results 
previously demonstrated by bacterial degradation of Reactive Red 
141 and Amaranth dyes [34,35]. Complete decolorization was 
obtained for MO and EBT at 35°C and 45°C. CR showed complete 
decolorization only at 35°C. This is in accordance with results 
previously given for decolorization of Acid Orange by S. hominis 
and decolorization of azo dyes by Micrococcus  sp. [30,37,39].
Temperature increase can stimulate bacterial proliferation and 
increase decolorization efficiency [19].
The results conclude that Citrobacter sp. can be used for successful 
dye decolorization of Azo dyes; primarily MO, CR, and EBT under 
optimum physiochemical conditions. Further work needs to be 
done on complete mineralization of dyes. Scaling up the process 
also remains a challenge. Since metal ions like Copper, Lead, and 
Cadmium are present in high concentration in industrial effluents 
[23], it is also important to study their effects individually on azo 
dye bioremediation.
