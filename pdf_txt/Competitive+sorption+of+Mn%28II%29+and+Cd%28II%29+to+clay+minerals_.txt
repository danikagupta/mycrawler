Redox variable environments such as riparian floodplain soils, wetlands, and rice 
paddies are of great importance in the mobilization of trace elements from 
terrestrial  environments in to aquatic systems. Elevated dissolved  concentrations 
of trace elements in terrestrial  and aquatic systems are of concern since they can 
cause detrimental effects on the biosphere due to toxic responses in plants (e.g. 
Mn, Zn, Cu) as well as in animals and humans (e. g. Cd, Pb). Both natural sources 
(e.g., presence of trace metal -enriched minerals) and anthropogenic sources 
(e.g., agriculture, industrial and mining activities) can lead to local enrichments of 
trace elements in the environment. During periods of water -saturation , high 
concentrations of dissolved Mn2+ are observed in redox variable environments as 
a result of the reductive dissolution of Mn(IV,III) -(oxyhydr)oxides. Consequently,  
the high concentrations of Mn2+ are expected to compete  with trace elements 
cations (e.g. Ca2+, Zn2+, Cd2+) for adsorption to mineral surfaces and therefore 
influence their fate in the environment. Herein, the m obility and  the bioavailability 
of trace elements in soils is mainly controlled by surface adsorption to soil solids 
including clay minerals, oxides of iron, manganese and aluminium, as well as 
natural organic matter. Clay minerals are widespread in soils and are among the 
most important sorbents for trace elements due to their large specific surface  
area, negative surface c harge and reactive surface hydroxyl groups.   
To date , it is not well known  how and to which extent the sorption of Mn2+ to clay 
minerals surfaces influences the retention of other trace elements under reducing 
conditions.  To investigate this, we first performed single metal sorption 
experiments under anoxic conditions (O 2 < 0.1 ppm) using a synthetic iron -free 
montmorillonite (Syn-1) to elucidate the sorption of Mn2+ and Cd2+ at the clay 
mineral -water interface  as function of pH (4 -10), total metal conc entration (0.001 -
1 mM) and CaCl 2 background electrolyte concentration (0.1 -30 mM).   
The sorption of Mn2+ and Cd2+ to Syn-1 as function of the dissolved metal  
concentration (sorption isotherm)  and pH (sorption edge) are shown in F igure 1.  
An increase of Mn2+ and Cd2+ sorption  was observed with increasing metal  
concentration in solution  (1a, c) and pH (1b, d)  due to proton -metal cation 
competition for binding sites. In the sorption isotherm  data (1a, c),  a sorption 
maximum was not observed for either cation indicating that the sorption sites  had 
not been saturated  with respect to Mn2+ and Cd2+, respectively . This also applies 
to the data on pH -dependent sorption (1b, d) considering the chosen total metal 
concentrations. However, not ed that the amount Mn2+ and Cd2+ sorbed at pH 7.8 15th Swiss Geoscience Meeting, Davos  2017 
 
and 7.4 respectively , clearly exceed the CEC of Syn-1 (~0.07 mol/kg), indicating 
an additional sorption mechanism through surface complexation.  The 
pronounced effect of Ca on Mn and Cd sorption at pH ≤ 5.5 and the virtual 
absence of a pH -dependence at pH below  5 and [Ca] ≥ 1 mM  indicate the binding 
to permanently negatively charged surfaces sites dominated the sorption of Mn 
and Cd under these conditio ns (Fig 1b, d) . The clear influence of Ca on the pH -
dependent sorption of Mn and Cd at pH 6 –9 (Fig 1b, d) further suggests that 
outer -sphere surface complexation to negatively charged edge surfaces sites of 
Syn-1 significantly contributed to Mn and Cd sorp tion at circumneutral to alkaline 
conditions. The absence of Ca -independence in Mn and Cd sorption data at trace 
levels of dissolved Mn and Cd implies that inner -sphere surface complexation to 
edge surface sites is marginal even at low concentrations. The quantitative 
similarity of Mn and Cd sorption at 0.1 mM Ca in both sorption isotherm data (Fig 
1a, c) and pH -dependent data (Fig 1b, d) indicates that elevated levels of 
dissolved Mn , as observed in water -saturated terrestrial environments , may very 
effectively compete with Cd bound to clay minerals. As a consequence, increased 
Mn concentrations may trigger Cd release from clay surfaces and increase Cd 
mobility and bioavailability.

function of dissolved  metal concentration (10-3 to 10-8 M) (a, c) and pH ( b, d), at 
different CaCl 2 concentrations. Sorption isotherm s were recorded at fixed pH 
7.8±0.1 for (Mn2+) and for pH 7.4±0.1 for Cd2+. Total  metal concentrations  of 1 
µM were used to investigate pH -dependence of sorption (b, d) . All samples were 
equilibrated for  1 day.
