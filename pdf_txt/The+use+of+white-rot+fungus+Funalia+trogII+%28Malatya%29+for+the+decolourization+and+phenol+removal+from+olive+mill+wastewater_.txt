Abstract 
A synthesis of the analytical work carried out on the characterisation of Olive 
Mill Wastewater (OMW) is given, covering articles published over the last 
30 years, being excluded all data that didn't account phenol quantification. 
Due to the wide range of the data on OMW characterisation found in the 
literature, results on Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen 
Demand, Total Solids and Volatile Solids are summarised and correlations 
between them and with polyphenol content are sought. 
The aim of this work is to use the modelling of the analytical parameters to 
define working limits, in order to be able to predict and monitor successfully 
an OMW treatment. Scale-up 
from 
previously published data will be 
considered, trying to overcome the case-by-case studies found in the 
literature. 
Thls 
modelling also contributes to obtain a good experimental 
performance with a specific OMW. 
Portuguese OMW characterisation for the aforementioned parameters is 
carried out, as well as the validation of the correlations found for the 
parameters in the literature.

1 Introduction 
Olive Mill Wastewaters (OMW) are generated as a residue in the production 
of olive oil and their elimination is a major environmental problem in 
Mediterranean countries, where the production is very high and concentrated 
in a short period of time (November-February). The annual OMW production 
is estimated to be over 30 X 106 m3 [l-31. 
The composition of OMW is very variable and depends on olive variety, the 
ripeness of the fruit, and the extraction process (press or centrifuge) [4]. 
Typical OMW composition by weight is: 83-94% water, 4-16% organic 
compounds and 0.4-2.5% mineral salts. The organic fraction contains, among 
other components, 2-15% of polyphenols; divided into low-molecular weight 
compounds (caffeic acid, 
tyrosol, 
hydroxytirosol, p-cumaric acid, ferulic 
acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid etc.) and high molecular weight 
compounds (tannins, 
anthocianins, 
etc) [5-71 as well as catechol-melaninic 
polymers [g]. 
The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) ranges from 2 to 220 gdm-3 [9,10]; 
the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) ranges from 4.3 to 93.5 gdm'3 
[l 1,121; the total solids (TS) are 5.9 to 103.2 gdm-3 [9,13]; Volatile solids 
(VS) are 2.4 to 89.9 [9,13] and the content of polyphenols 0.1-17.5 
gdm-3 [9,14]. The high content of organic matter and polyphenols together 
with the very large volumes produced and the seasonality of the industry has 
led to considerable pollution and has limited the application of conventional 
methods of wastewater treatment [2]. The aim of this work is to use the 
modelling of the analytical parameters to define working limits, in order to be 
able to predict and monitor successfully an OMW treatment. We will present 
models based on 82 OMW characteristics. 
2 Materials and methods 
A literature survey was carried out and the parameters usually used to 
characterise OMW were selected. The most common parameters found were: 
COD, 
BOD,, 
phenol, TS and VS, with phenol concentration and COD by far 
the most common parameters determined. The Portuguese OMW 
characterisation was carried out by the determination of the aforementioned 
parameters according to the following experimental procedure. 
2.1 COD, TS , VS, BOD 
These parameters were determined according to the procedure described in 
Standard Methods [l 51.

2.2 Determination of polyphenols in solution 
2.2.1 Folin-Denis method 
Was based on oxireduction reactions between phenolic compounds and 
metallic ions adapted 
ftom 
a method describe by 
Duran 
[16]. 
In each centrifuge tube 3.75 mL of distilled water was added to 0.5 mL of the 
sample and 0.25 mL of Folin-Denis reagent (Fluka, p.a.), the solutions were 
yellow at this stage. After waiting 5 minutes, 0.5 rnL of sodium carbonate 
20% (Merck, p.a.) was mixed into solution using a vortex and left for about 
10 minutes for the reaction to complete. The samples were then centrifuged 
for 
10 
minutes (Sigma 2-15 B. Braun), at 5000 rpm. The absorbance of the 
liquid phase was measured using a quartz cell, (optical path 1 cm) in a 
spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2000) at a wavelength of 725 nm. 
A standard calibration graph was prepared by plotting absorbance vs caffeic 
acid concentrations ranging from 0-100 ppm. Results were expressed in 
terms of caffeic acid equivalent as this was used as a reference substance. 
3 Results and discussion 
The modelling of OMW characteristics was studied using two different 
strategies, an exhaustive bibliographic research was carried out and 42 values 
of OMW characterisation were encountered and used for the model 
development, the second approach was the validation of the model proposed 
by the introduction of 40 values from Portuguese OMW characterisation. 
It is important to take into account that the values collected from the 
bibliographic survey concern different OMW source countries, different hit 
varieties and ripeness, different extraction systems (pressing and 
centrifuging) and were evaluated by the application of different analytical 
techniques. For the Portuguese case the same aforementioned variables were 
considered, in this case the source country was obviously the same and the 
analytical procedures for OMW characterisation. 
The bibliographic references found in literature are summarised in Table 1 
and those for the Portuguese case in Table 2.

Bearing in mind the application of the model to several OMW in a collective 
OMW treatment plant, the model applied to average values is preferable to be 
used. For average values the same second-degree polynomial function fitted 
and the R' increased to 0.85 14 for all values. 
The low frequency of phenol values together with the absence of values in 
some intervals for high phenol concentration, led us to represent the model 
until the phenol concentration of 8 kgm3, as is presented in Figure 4.

The main feature in these representations is that for this range both second 
degree polynomial and linear functions fit well and the is very similar for 
both of them, however the increase of phenol content in OMW the COD 
doesn't follow this increase and gets to a saturation point as was 
demonstrated by the polynomial function for high phenol content (Figures1 
and 2). Although linearity is observed for low phenol concentrations, the 
second-degree polynomial model is preferable because it fits well for high 
and low concentrations.

4 Conclusions and future work 
Despite the fact that the OMW characteristics were obtained from different 
countries, with different olive varieties, fiom different years, from mills with 
different extraction processes and were obtained using different techniques in 
different laboratories, a good correlation between COD and phenols is found 
using second-degree polynomial function. 
The model developed may be useful not only for OMW treatment plant 
conception but also for monitoring it as allows less time consumption on 
analytical work. When considering a collective OMW treatment plant is 
plausible to use the model developed from the overall average values, h the 
future, the models will be completed with more OMW characterization 
values and their optimization will be pursued.
