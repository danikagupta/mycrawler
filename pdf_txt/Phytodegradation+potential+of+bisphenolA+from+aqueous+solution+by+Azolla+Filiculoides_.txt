Abstract  : Industrial wastewater is one of the major environmental pollutants. Discharge of the 
colorful industrial waste into the receptive waters leads to eutrophication and has mutagenic 
and carcinogenic properties In order to understand the biosorption of Acid Or ang 7 (AO7) 
textile dye on dried Cyperus Rotundus (CR), batch experiments were conducted under various 
conditions. Adsorption isotherms were examined by six different isotherm and four Error 
Functions that finally showed the langmuir models closely fitted the experimental results. The 
maximum monolayer adsorption capacities of biomass are 32.21 mg/g at 273 K, 35.69 mg/g at 
293 K and 38.45 at 313 K, respectively. Therefore adsorption capacity increases with 
increasing temperature , that shows the adsorption i s an endothermic process. The results 
showed that the percentage of removal reached 98.9% from wastewater containing 25 mg/L 
AO7 dye, indicating that the Cyperus Rotundus biomass could be used as a potential biosorbent 
for the removal of AO7 dye from aqueo us solution .

Introduction:   
Water pollution by organic chemicals is a major problem over decades1,2. Industrial effluents are one of 
the major causes of environmental pollution because effluents discharged from dyeing industries are highly 
colored with a large amount of suspended organic solid3. As a result, these industrial effluents have become one 
of the major pollutants to the aquatic environment and will cause considerable damage to the receiving waters if 
not properly treated4. Dyes in these industrial effluents a re difficult to remove due to the variety of aromatic 
components which they contain and which are highly resistant to aerobic digestion and oxidization5,6. Due to 
low biodegradabil ity of dyes, a conventional  biological  treatment  process  is  not  very effective in treating a 
dye wastewater7, 8. It is usually treated by physical or chemical processes9, 10. However these processes are 
costly and cannot effectively be used to treat the wide range of dye wastewaters11. Adsorption on activated 
carbon (ACR) has been found to be an effectiv e process for dye removal, but it is too expensive12. Consequently 
numerous low cost alternatives have been proposed including Azolla13, cashew nut shell14, Canola15, 16, 
sawdust17, husk rice18, Hazelnut Shells19, coir pith20, Lemna minor21. New economical, easily available and 
highly effective adsorbents are still needed. Cyperus Rotundus (CR)  is one of the most  invasive  weeds  known, 
having spread out to a worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate regions22. It has been called "the world's 
worst weed,  as it is known as a weed in over 90 countries, and infests over 50 crops worldwide23. The difficulty 
to control it is a result of its intensive system of under ground  tubers , and its resistance to most  herbicides24. 
Weed pulling in gardens usually results in breakage of roots, leaving tubers in the ground from which new 
plants emerge quickly25. Most herbicides may kill the plant's leave s, but most have no effect on the root system

and the tubers  and therefore poses many negative effects to aquatic ecology22. However, using CR as a 
bioabsorbent to remove dyes from the industrial effluents would be a “win –win” solution for both 
environmental problems23. In this study, dried CR was used as a biosorbent to remove Acid Orang 7 (AO7) as a 
target pollutant from aqueous solution. The aim was to  study the affects influencing biosorption of AO7 on 
dried CR using batch experiments under different experimental conditions, including Contact time, initial dye 
concentration and temperature and initial AO7 concentrations.  
Materials and Methods:  
The dye  used in the experiments was AO7, which was provided from Alvan Sabet Company of Iran and 
the other chemicals used in these experiments were the product of the Merck Company (Darmstadt, Germany). 
Double distilled water (DDW) was used throughout the study. Table 1 shows the structure of the investigated 
dye. The AO7 is azo and contain anionic sulphonate groups. Stock solutions of dye were prepared by dissolving 
the powder in double distilled water. Dye solutions of different initial concentrations were prepa red by diluting 
the stock solution in appropriate proportions.   
Cyperus Rotundus was collected from Tabriz agricultural school, Iran. The collected materials were 
then washed several times with distilled water to remove all dirt particles. The washing pro cess was continued 
till the wash water contained no color. The washed materials were then dried at 50 
  for 12 h. The dried 
materials were then ground, using steel mill. The adsorbent was sieved through 1 -2 mm sieve. The crushed 
particles were then treated with 0.1M HCl for 5 h followed by washing with distilled water and then kept for 
shaded dry26. The resultant biomass was subsequently used in sorption experiments.  
Batch adsorption experiments were performed using 200 ml glass bottles with addition of 4 g CR 
Biomass and 100 mL of AO 7 solution of increased initial concentrations (C 0) from 25 to 200 mg/L. The glass 
bottles were sealed and placed within a temperature control box to maintain water temperature. The pH of the 
samples was adjusted by adding 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH to each 1 00 ml of the prepared solution to pH 7. 
The pH of solutions was measured with a pH meter. In the experiments on the effect of temperature, the 
temperature was held at 273, 293, and 313 K and the pH was fixed at 7. At the end of the equilibrium period, 
the suspensions were separated for later analysis of the dye concentration. The amount of AO7 adsorption at 
equilibrium q e (mg/g) was calculated from the following equation27-29: 
qe = (C 0 − Ct )V/W  
Whe re C 0 and Ce (mg/L) are the liquid -phase concentrations of dye at initial and equilibrium, respectively, V 
(L) the volume of the solution and W (g) is the mass of adsorbent used. The concentration of AO7 after and 
before adsorption was determined using a s pectrophotometer (λ max = 452 nm).

Results and Discussion:  
Effect of contact time and initial dye concentration:  
The adsorption of AO7 onto CR was studied as a function of contact time in order to decide whether the 
equilibrium was reached. For this, 100 mg L−1 of AR88 solutions at pH 7 were contacted with 4 g L−1 of CR 
suspensions. The samples were ta ken at different periods of time and analyzed for their AR88 concentration 
(Fig. 1). Dye adsorption onto AO7 increased from 42.1% to 98.9% when the contact time was increased from Hossein Azarpira  et al /International Journal of ChemTech Research,  2016,9(9),pp 543 -549. 545 
 
10 to 75 min . The AO7 adsorption rate is high at the beginning of the experiment because initially the 
adsorption sites are more available and AO7 ions are easily adsorbed on these sites30-32. The equilibrium can be 
reached within 75 min, and thus, further a dsorption experiments were carried out for a contact time of 75 min. 
The equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for AO7 increased with increasing initial dye 
concentration, as is also shown in Fig. 1. The dye adsorption capacity is highly concent ration dependent. The 
increase in loading capacity of the adsorbent with relation to dye ions is probably due to a high driving force for 
mass transfer33-35. At 27
 , when the initial dye concentration was increased from 25 to 200 mg/L, the loading 
capacity of dried adsorbent increased from 6.71 to 36.45 mg of AO7 per gram of CR biomass.

Adsorption Isotherms:   
The experimental data at  equilibrium between the amount of adsorbed dye (q e) on the adsorbent and the 
concentration of dye in solution (C e) at a constant temperature and pH were used to describe the optimum 
isotherm model. The linear forms of Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin - Radushkevich (D -R), Harkin -
Jura and Halsey isotherm models equations (Table 2) were used to describe the equilibrium data.

Error Functions:  
The usual way to validate the isotherms is to consider the goodness -of-fit using the linear regression 
coefficients, R2. However, using only the linear regression method may not be appropriate for comparing the 
goodness of fit of different isotherms. This is because an occurrence of the inherent bias resulting from 
linearization may affect the deduction. Therefore, in this  study in addition to the linear regression analysis, the  ref

The values of various isotherms  constants are described in Table 3 . The correlation coefficients was 
high for all isotherms. The ARE, SD, χ2 and SSE values are smaller for the Langmuir isotherms, suggesting that 
langmuir models closely fitted the experimental results. Previously some researchers investigated several 
adsorbents such as rice husk28, cashew nut shell14, Canola15, Hazelnut Shells19 and Azolla13 for the removal of 
dye from aqueous solutions. in this study adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature then the 
adsorption is an endothermic process.

Conclusions:  
Acid Orang 7 adsorption by Cyperus Rotundus  biomass was studied in batch mode and it was strongly 
dependent on initial concentration and temperature. High initial concentration and temperature favor the AO7 
adsorption on the biomass. The isotherm study indicates that adsorption data fit well with L angmuir models. R L 
values from Langmuir model and 1/n from Freundlich model indicate that the removal of AO7 on the CR is 
favorable. The study showed that CR biomass could be used as a new and efficient adsorbent material for the 
removal of AO7 from aqueou s solution.
