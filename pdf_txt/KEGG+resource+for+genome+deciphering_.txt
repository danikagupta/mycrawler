Overview of KEGG
•From building blocks to biological systems
•Integration of genomics and chemistry
An ultimate goal of bioinformatics  is a complete computer
representation of the cell and the organism , which will
enable computational prediction of higher-level complexity ,
such as
from genomic information .•molecular interaction networks involving various
cellular processes and
•phenotypes (morphological, physiological, and
behavioral aspects) of entire organismsGoal

•Sequence similarity between two genes (or proteins)
may imply ortholog or paralog relationship.
•Orthologs are genes in different species evolved
from a common ancestral gene by speciation and
tend to have the same function.
•Paralogs are generated by gene duplication within a
species and often represent diversified functions in a
broader functional category.
•Identification of ortholog relationships is the basis for
genome annotation (assigning gene functions), and
it requires distinction from paralog relationships.Human MouseCommon

•EC numbers represent classification of
enzymatic reactions (and enzymes)
•Manually assigned by IUBMB-IUPAC
Biochemical Nomenclature Committee
•Published experimental evidence on the
enzyme and the reaction is required
•Four numbers separated by periods,
representing reaction specificity (class,
sub-class, and sub-subclass numbers)
and substrate specificity (serial number).A.red + C.ox

Web•KEGG is a computer representation of the
biological systems.
•KEGG objects (database entries) are
highly integrated.
•KEGG objects are linked to/from major life
science databases.
•KEGG objects are part of the Web; they
can be found by Web search engines.

•Small molecules: metabolite, environmental compound, drug, etc.
•Molecular systems: pathway, complex, ontology, etc.
More complex data types
•Biopolymers: linear sequence, circular sequence, tree structure,
