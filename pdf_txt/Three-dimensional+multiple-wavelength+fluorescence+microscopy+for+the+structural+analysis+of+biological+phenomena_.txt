Abstract:  We propose a new method for high-speed, three-dimensional (3-
D) fluorescence imaging, which we re fer to as dual-detection confocal 
fluorescence microscopy (DDCFM). In contrast to conventional beam-
scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, where the focal spot must be 
scanned either optically or mechanically over a sample volume to 
reconstruct a 3-D image, DDCFM can obtain the depth of a fluorescent 
emitter without depth scanning. DDCFM comprises two photodetectors, 
each with a pinhole of diffe rent size, in the confocal detection system. Axial 
information on fluorescent emitters can be measured by the axial response 
curve through the ratio of intensity signals. DDCFM can rapidly acquire a 
3-D fluorescent image from a single two-dimensional scan with less 
phototoxicity and photobleaching than confocal fluorescence microscopy 
because no mechanical depth scans are needed. We demonstrated the 
feasibility of the proposed method by phantom studies.

1. Introduction 
Fluorescence microscopy has become an essential tool in biology and biomedicine by 
visualizing certain molecules and cells in high contrast with endogenous and exogenous fluorescent molecules. Fluor escent imaging is used in many biological and medical 
applications, including analysis of cell microstructures, localization of protein expression, and measurement of dynamic mo lecular processes [1–6]. 
Confocal fluorescence microscopy has the ability to acquire optically-sectioned images 
from a thick specimen using a confocal pinhole to  effectively eliminate out-of-focus noise [7, 
8]. One of the main advantages of confo cal fluorescence micros copy over conventional 
fluorescence microscopy is that live specimens can be observed with high resolution and contrast. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy can reconstruct a three-dimensional 
(3-D) image of a biological sample [1]. Sin ce confocal fluorescence microscopy acquires a 
point image of a conjugate point with a pinhole pl aced in front of a detector, the point must be 
scanned over the specimen volume to create a 3-D image [7]. Creating a 3-D image by 
reconstructing a stack of 2-D images is time intensive and induces phototoxicity and photobleaching due to the rep eated light exposure [9–11]. 
To overcome these limitations, fast 3-D imaging methods have been developed. Selective 
plane illumination microscopy uses light sheet illumination from the side of the sample to

29 July 2013 | Vol. 21,  No. 15 | DOI:10.1364/OE.21.017839 | OPTICS EXPRESS  17840create an optically-sectioned fluorescent image [12, 13]. This technique allows fast 3-D 
imaging with reduced photobleachin g, but it suffers from spatial constraints due to the side 
illumination. Abrahamsson et al.  [14] proposed multifocus microscopy, which acquires 
multiple images from different focal planes using specially designed gratings. However, the 
detection system is relatively complex, and the number of focal planes is fixed. 
Three-dimensional fluorescence imaging without depth scanning is another approach to 
rapidly acquire three-dimensional fluorescent information and to reduce phototoxicity and 
photobleaching. Chromatic conf ocal microscopy uses a broadband light source and an 
objective with longitudinal chromatic aberrations, which generate multiple, axially-distributed 
foci depending on wavelength [15–17]. Chromatic confocal microscopy has been most widely 
developed using reflectance imaging for surface profiling, while several studies have 
investigated fluorescence and nonlinear opti cal imaging [18–21]. Differential confocal 
microscopy, which uses two or more detectors, is another method to measure surface shape with 2-D scans [22–28]. To our knowledge, fluorescence differential confocal microscopy has 
not yet been reported. By analyzing fluorescen ce self-interference signal, the location of the 
fluorescence signal can be determined [29, 30]. Depth discrimination technique of a 
fluorescent signal without a mechanical dept h scan enables rapid visualization of 3-D 
distribution of fluorescence labels. This technique also has potential to be developed as a miniature endoscopic probe for in vivo volumetric imaging. In this paper, we propose a novel 
method for axial imaging without axial scanning, called dual-detection confocal fluorescence 
microscopy (DDCFM). 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic of DDCFM. Light from a point source is reflected by a dichroic mirror (DM) 
and illuminates the sample. Light from a fluorescent emitter within the focal volume in the 
sample passes through the DM and is split by a be am splitter (BS). Each beam is directed to 
the photomultiplier tube (PMT) through a pinhole. Pinhole 1 (P1) is smaller than pinhole 2 
(P2). 
2. Principle of DDCFM 
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of DDCFM, which uses two pinhole detectors with 
different sizes, while conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy uses only one pinhole 
detector. For DDCFM, light from the fluorescent sample is split by a beam splitter, then 
directed to two pinhole detectors. Since each pinho le is of a different size, each detector has a 
different axial response. Thus, a new axial response curve of the intensity ratio can be calculated from the ratio of signals received at each detector. The axial response curve of the 
intensity ratio indicates the relationship between the axial position of the fluorescent sample 
and the intensity ratio. In DDCFM, the axial distance of the sample from the focal plane can

29 July 2013 | Vol. 21,  No. 15 | DOI:10.1364/OE.21.017839 | OPTICS EXPRESS  17841be calculated using the intensity ratio of the fluorescent emitter. As a result, the DDCFM can 
be used to rapidly determine the depth of a fluorescent signal in a sample without the need for 
depth scanning. 
The axial response curve in confocal fluore scence microscopy depends on the pinhole 
size. Since an out-of-focus beam is filtered by the pinhole, a detector placed behind the 
pinhole receives the highest signal when the fluorescent emitter is in the focal plane of the 
objective. In other words, the peak of the axial response curve is on the focal point, and the 
signal value gradually decreases as the object moves away from the focal point [31]. When 
light passes through the optical system, the amplitude and phase change of the field are 
explained as diffraction properties and are used  to create the axial response curve [7]. To 
express the axial response curve of confocal fluorescence microscopy according to the 
pinhole size, the intensity of a point object with a finite-size circular detector is obtained as

where sinα is the numerical aperture (NA), and r and z are the radial and axial coordinates, 
respectively. 
The PSF describes the impulse response, which is explained by Fresnel diffraction of the 
imaging system [33]. The intensity on the detector is determined by the square of the PSF 
because the intensity is the squa re of the field amplitude [7]. 
If we assume that ()Pρ is a circular, uniform aperture  with the same radius as the 
objective lens, and ()Dv is a circular pinhole detector [7, 31], from Eq. (1), the axial response 
curve becomes,

where 
pv represents the radius of the pinhole. As in Eq. (4), the axial response curve is a 
function of the axial optical coordinate, u, and the radius of the pinhole,
pv. The pinhole size 
determines the axial response curve, and, in general, larger pinholes generate wider axial 
response curves. 
The fluorescence intensity is also proportional to quantum yield, which is the number of 
photons emitted per photons absorbed. The quantum yield varies according to the surroundings. If we account for the fluorescen ce quantum yield, the fl uorescence intensity can 
be expanded as

pv. 
Since DDCFM has two detectors with different pinhole sizes, two axial response curves 
are generated with different full widths at half maximum (FWHM). We can calculate the 
intensity ratio with the small and large pinholes.  Since, both intensity values are proportional 
to the same quantum yield, the axial response curve of the intensity ratio is independent of the 
quantum yield. When the two pinhole sizes are pre-determined and fixed, the intensity ratio is 
a function of z, yielding the following expression

where 1()Iz and 2()Iz are the intensities detected by pinhole 1 and pinhole 2, respectively, at a 
specific axial position, z. The intensity ratio according to axial position becomes the axial 
response curve of the DDCFM system, as shown in Fig. 2. The axial position of the 
fluorescence emitter corresponds to a unique inte nsity ratio, and an intensity ratio corresponds 
to a unique axial position. Thus, using the axial response curves of the intensity ratio in DDCFM, the axial positions of fluorescent particles can be measured without axial scanning, 
even when the quantum yield of the fluorescent sample varies.

intensity signals measured by each PMT differ b ecause of different pinhole sizes. The blue and 
green line graphs show the axial response curves of the small (v p = 2.7) and large (v p = 13.5) 
pinholes, respectively. The ratio of the axial res ponse curves is indicated by the red line. Since 
the relationship between the intensity ratio a nd the axial position is one-to-one, the intensity 
ratio directly indicates the axial position of the fluorescence source. 
3. System setup 
To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we built a DDCFM system, as shown 
in Fig. 3. The DDCFM has two detectors, each with a pinhole of a different diameter. A 
488nm wavelength laser (35-LAL-030-220, Melles Griot, NM) was used as the light source. After it was collimated, the excitation beam passed the excitation filter (LL01-488-25, Semrock, NY). A dichroic mirror (Di02-R488, Semrock, NY) reflected the beam to a 2-D 
scanner comprising a galvanometer mirror (6240H, Cambridge technology, MA) and a 
resonant mirror (000-3015013, GSI Lumonics, MI). This scanner system was used to rapidly 
scan the x-y plane of th e fluorescent sample. An imaging rate of 15.6 frames per second with 
512 × 512 pixels was achieved using the resonant mirror with a resonant frequency of 8kHz. A relay lens expanded the beam diameter by three times and caused the beam to pass through 
the center of the objective wh ile scanning the imaging field. The relay lens enabled the 
system to have a large field-of-view (FOV), up to 4000 × 4000 μ m. An objective lens (378-
801-6, Mitutoyo, Japan) focused the beam onto the fluorescent sample. The FWHM of the

29 July 2013 | Vol. 21,  No. 15 | DOI:10.1364/OE.21.017839 | OPTICS EXPRESS  17843axial response curve depends on the NA of the objective and the pinhole size. An objective 
lens with a relatively low effective NA of 0.04 5 was used for long axial measurements. Light 
emitted from the fluorescent sample traveled back through the objective, relay lens, x-y 
scanner, dichroic mirror, and emission filter (FF03-525/50-25, Semrock, NY). 
The filtered beam was divided by a 50/50 beam splitter (BS010, Thorblas, NJ). The two 
beams were focused by two collecting lenses (NT47-641, Edmund, NJ) onto pinholes of 
different sizes. The diameter of the airy disk on the pinhole was used to determine the pinhole 
sizes [31]. The airy di sk diameter was 42.7 μ m at the detection plane. The small and large 
pinhole diameters were 30 μm and 150 μm, respectively. The fluorescent emission was 
measured by the two PMTs (H6779-20, Hamamatsu, Japan). 
 
Fig. 3. Schematic of the experimental setup.  The laser source was collimated then passed 
through an excitation filter. The beam was reflect ed by a dichroic mirror (DM) and scanned by 
an x-y scanner. A relay lens optical system directed the beam to the center of a 0.045-NA 
objective, despite various beam angles. The samp le was precisely moved in the axial direction 
by a PZT stage. Light emitted from the sample passed inversely through the optical 
components and then through a dichroic mi rror (DM) and emission filter. A 50/50 beam 
splitter (BS) divided the beam path equally, a nd two collecting lenses (C1, C2) focused the 
beam onto the PMTs. The pinhole in front of PM T 1 was smaller than the pinhole in front of 
PMT 2. The pinhole diameters were 30 μm and 150 μm. 
4. Experiment and results 
We tested the performance of DDCFM by imaging various fluorescent beads and a 
fluorescent-stained sample. We measured the axial response curve of DDCFM. A fluorescent 
sample with sparsely distributed standard fluorescent beads was prepared by spreading 6 μm 
fluorescent beads (I-14785, Invitrogen, CA) on a glass slide. We used the piezoelectric (PZT) stage (MIPOS, piezosystem jena, MA) to move the fluorescent sample axially in 1 μm 
increments over a 300 μ m range. The bead intensity was m easured by two PMTs at each step. 
Figure 4 shows the measured axial response cu rves of DDCFM. As the fluorescent beads 
moved away from the focal point, the bead intensity decreased for both the small and large pinholes. The normalized intensities measured with the small and large pinholes are indicated 
by the blue and green lines, respectively. The two axial response curves show that the intensity at the small pinhole decreased rapidly as the bead moved out of focus. On the other 
hand, the signal decrease was much slower for the large pinhole. The ratio of the two curves 
is shown by the red line, which illustrates the dependency of the axial position on the ratio of 
the two axial response curves. These curves were  used as a standard to calculate the axial 
position of a fluorescent emitter from the intensity ratio without axial scanning.

quintic polynomial to form a calibration curve, since the ratio and height have a relatively 
linear relation. Thus, in this experime nt, the axial measurement range was 180 μm. 
 
Fig. 4. Axial response curves. At each height, intensity was measured with 30 μm (blue) and 
150 μm (green) pinholes. The intensity ratio of pinholes 1 and 2 is shown in red. Using the 
intensity ratio curve, the axial position of  a fluorescent particle can be measured. 
To evaluate the performance of DDCFM, the he ight of a fluorescent bead was measured 
when the bead moved axially from the focal plane. The fluorescent sample was 6 μm 
fluorescent beads spread sparsely on a glass s lide. The sample was attached to the PZT stage 
to change the sample height. Two PMTs detected the fluorescence intensities as the beads moved. The ratio of two PMT signals was calculated, and the bead height was calculated 
from the height measurement curve. 
Figure 5 shows the axial movement of a bead. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show linear and step 
sample movements, respectively. The solid blue lines show the stage movement, and green 
spots show the bead height measured by DDCFM . To accurately evaluate  the axial position, 
the standard deviation (SD) of the difference between the stage height and measured height 
was calculated. The SD was 7.42 μm for linear movement and 4.98 μm for step movement.

separated by 105.6 μm on average. Scale bars: 100 μm. 
To demonstrate the 3-D imaging capabilities of DDCFM, a 3-D sample was prepared then 
imaged. The 3-D sample was made by placing fl uorescent beads at two different heights. An 
aluminum block was machined in to a step shape, as shown in  Fig. 6(a). The difference in 
level height was 105 μ m (Fig. 6(b)), as determined by commercial 3-D confocal microscopy 
(NS-I3500, Nanoscopesystems, Korea). Fluorescent beads were sparsely spread on the block, 
so that beads on level  were 105 μm higher than beads on level . 
For DDCFM, the focus was scanned over a single 700 × 700 μm lateral plane. Height 
information was collected in a single 2-D DDCFM scan. Figures 6(c) and 6(d) show the 2-D 
images from the small and large pinhole, respectively. The resulting normalized ratio of 
intensity, shown in Fig. 6(e), shows beads distributed on the two steps in the x-y plane. Since 
the focal plane was close to level , the ratio for beads on level  was larger than that for 
beads on level . The ratios of beads on each level were clearly different, while the beads on 
the same level had similar ratios. From the intensity ratio image, the height of each emitter 
was reconstructed over a wide transverse x-y field and is represented by color bar in Fig. 6(f). Mean bead heights on levels  and  were 122.3 μm and 16.7 μm, respectively. The mean 
distance between the two levels was calculated to be 105.6 μm, which shows that DDCFM 
accurately measures fluorescent sample heights.  The SD of the height measurement, which 
represents the accuracy of DDCFM, was 6.5 μm on the left and 5.1 μ m on the right. 
We tested whether DDCFM performs well with  samples of varying brightness. As shown 
in Fig. 7(a), the sample comprised two kinds of fluorescent beads with different quantum 
yields (I-14785 (100%) and (0.3%), Invitrogen , CA) on a glass slide. Although all beads were 
on the same flat surface, the bead intensities differed due to different quantum yields (Figs. 7(b) and 7(c)). The bead heights could not be calculated by intensity measured with only one 
PMT because of varying intensities. The intensity ratio, however, was not influenced by 
quantum yield. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the inte nsity ratios were uniform regardless of quantum 
yield. Based on these ratios, Fig. 7(e) shows the height map of beads that were uniformly 
distributed with a SD of 8.86 μ m. These results show that DDCFM is able to precisely 
measure the axial positions of fluorescent emitters with various quantum yields.

To demonstrate the potential of DDCFM to  image 3-D structures, 3-D image of a 
fluorescent sample was obtained with a single 512 × 512 pixel raster scan without depth 
scanning. The sample was knitted nylon fabric stained with fluorescein (fluorescein sodium salt, Sigma-Aldrich, MO). Figure 8 shows fluore scent images of the nylon fabric structure. 
Figures. 8(a) and 8(b) are normalized intensity images of the nylon fabric in a 4000  ×  4000 
× 180 μ m field of view taken with small and large pinhole, respectively. Large field of view 
and large depth range was obtained using an objective lens with low NA (NA = 0.045). A median filter and an averaging filter with a size of 3 × 3 pixels were applied to the DDCFM 
images to reduce the noise. Pixels having intensity below a certain threshold (0.05 × max intensity) were removed from calculation. After image pre-processing, intensity ratio was calculated then converted to height information. The corresponding 3-D reconstruction, 
shown in Fig. 8(c), was colored according to sample height. Different height of nylon fibers 
can be seen in the color-coded height map. 
Also, we acquired a stack of 2-D images of th e same sample with a confocal microscopy 
mode to directly compare th e DDCFM with conventional conf ocal microscopy. We acquired 
a total of 181 sections with a confocal microscopy mode using the small pinhole, while moving the sample axially by 1 μm at each step. In order to reduce the width of axial response 
curve, we used different objective lens with higher NA (NA = 0.16) (UPLSAPO 4x, 
Olympus, Japan). Figure 8(d) shows two representative 2-D confocal images acquired with a 
confocal microscopy mode. Due to higher NA an d larger magnification, the field of view was 
reduced by half. 2-D confocal images with different depth clearly show different fabric structure. Height map was calcula ted from the stack of confocal  images by finding the axial 
(z) position whose intensity was maximized at a given transverse (xy) position. Color-coded height map is shown in Fig. 8(e). We acquired DDCFM image with a reduced field of view using low NA objective lens (NA = 0.045) to directly compare the DDCFM with confocal 
microscopy. Height map acquired by DDCFM without axial scanning is shown in Fig. 8(f). DDCFM (Fig. 8(f)) shows similar 3-D structure to confocal microscopy (Fig. 8(e)). Axial (xz) 
intensity images of the sample, reconstructed from 2-D stack of confocal microscopy (Fig. 
8(g)) and height profile of DDCFM (Fig. 8(h)) show similar pattern.

5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, we have presented the dual detection confocal fluorescence microscopy 
method to detect the axial position of fluores cent particles with a single shot. Two point 
detectors with different pinhol e sizes receive simultaneous fl uorescent signals, which depend 
on the pinhole size and axial position of the fl uorescent particle. The intensity ratio can be 
used to precisely measure the axial position where the fluorescence is emitted. DDCFM can 
provide depth information of a fluorescent sample  at high speed because no mechanical depth 
scanning is needed. Since this method measures a depth location of fluorophore, not a full depth profile, if there is more than one fluorop hore along the axial (z) direction at a transverse 
(xy) position, the depth measurement might be inaccurate. In this case, we anticipate that 
DDCFM measures the top position of the multiple fluorophores, since the closest fluorescent 
particle contributes most to the intensity ratio. Thus, the presented method works well for 
sparse fluorescent samples and surface profile, while it might have some errors for measuring 
dense samples with multilayer structure. Our results show that DDCFM is capable of 
visualizing fluorescent 3-D object with a r easonably complex structure as well as single 
fluorescent bead. Since DDCFM does not use repeated 2-D scans to create a 3-D 
reconstruction, photobleaching and phototoxicity can be greatly reduced compared to conventional laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Also, DDCFM has great 
potential to be miniaturized for a compact, endoscopic, 3-D fluore scence imaging probe.
