ABSTRACT  
Wastewater from various  types of  industries such as synthetic resins, plywood industries, paper and pulp,  
gas and coke oven plants, paints,  coal gas, tanning, textile, plastic, rubber, pharmaceutical, petroleum and 
mine  discharges , contain different types of phenols.  Phenolic compounds  are toxic substances and some 
are kn own or suspected carcinogens.  Therefor e it is important to remove phenol  and phenol ic compounds 
from contaminated industrial aqueous streams before discharged into any water bodies. Adsorption of 
phenol and its derivatives from aqueous solution by activated carbon is one of the most investigat ed of 
all liquid phase applications of carbon adsorbents. Several ad sorbents have been  used for treatment  of 
wastewater and removal of phenolic compounds . Literature contains various adsorption pr ocesses and 
adsorbents such as p istachio nut shell ash, Mori nga peregrina tree shell ash, agricultural fibers, red mud, 
low cost clay, olive mill waste, natural zeolites,  rubber seed coat,  peat, fly ash, bentonit e and …  which 
have been used for the removal of phenol and its derivatives . Any of chemical, biological and physical 
treatment processes has its own advantages and disadvantages. It  is worth  mentioning that economic 
aspects of these processes are important,  for example biosorption were found to be effective methods 
with scope for further research in this fie ld in terms of cost effectiveness and regeneration. At present 
study various adsorbents  used by the authors of this article and other researchers for phenol and its 
derivatives from aqueous environments have been reported and summarized.  Additionally, more  
research is needed to find the practical utility of low -cost adsorbents on commercial scale.

1. Introduction  
 
In recent years, increasing awareness of water pollution and its far rea ching effects has prompted 
concerted efforts towards pollution abatement  (Donmez et al. , 1999).  Contamination of aqueous 
environments by heavy metals and phenol ic compounds  is a worldwide environmental problem due to 
their toxic effects and accumulation th rough the food chain  (Kapoor et al. , 1999; Perez -Rama et al. , 2002; 
Sternberg and Dorn, 2002). With regard to increasing effluent discharge standards to the environment, 
high considerations should be made when selecting proper treatment processes. Any of c hemical, 
biological and p hysical treatment processes has  its own advantages and disadvantages. Application of 
some waste products that could help in this regard, in addition to reuse of these waste materials, can be APPLICATION OF ADSORPTION PROCESS  FOR PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS REMOVAL  147 
an advantage  (Mahvi , 2008).  Among the di fferent organic pollutants in wastewater, phenolic compounds 
are considered as priority pollutants since they are harmful to plants, animals and human, even at low 
concentrations. The major sources of phenolic compounds are steel mills, petroleum refinerie s, 
pharmaceuticals,  petrochemical, coke oven plants, paints,  coal gas, synthetic resins, plywood  industries 
and mine discharge. The wastewater with the highest concentration of phenol (>1000 m g l-1) is typically 
generated from coke processing. Phenolic com pounds are also emanated from resin plants with a 
concentration range of 12 –300 m g l-1. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a limit of 0.1 m g l-1 
of phenol in the treated effluent in order to protect human health from the potential toxic effects caused 
by exposure to phenol  (Balasubramanian and Venkatesan, 2012). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
is stricter on phenol regulation. It sets a 0.001 m g l-1 as the limit of phenol concentration in potable water  
(Radovic et al. , 2001). Therefore, phenol  is listed as a toxic substance and is included in the priority list of 
hazardous substances as well, which demonstrates its serious health and ecological effects  (Busca et al. , 
2008 ). Phenol ranks in the top 50 in production volumes for chemicals  produced  in the United Sta tes 
(Ahmaruzzaman, 2008 ). Biological treatment  (Li et al. , 2011; Bajaj et al. , 2008; Moussavi et al. , 2010 ), 
coagulation and electrocoagulation  (Bazrafshan et al. , 2012a; Bazrafshan et al. , 2012 b), ultrasonic 
degradation  (Mahvi, 2009; Maleki et al. , 2007; Pandit et al. , 2001), activated carbon adsorption and other 
adsorbents  (Bazrafshan et al. , 2012 c; Zarei et al. , 2013; Mahvi et al. , 2004; Mohan and Chander, 2001; El -
Naas et al. , 2010; Dursun et al. , 2005; Gurses and Yalcin, 2005 ), membra ne filtration  (Bodalo et al. , 2009 ), 
enzymatic treatments  (Mao et al. , 2006 ), solvent extraction  (Juang et al. , 2010 ), photocatalytic  
degradation  (Mahvi  et al. , 2007; Dianati -tilaki  et al. , 2014),  chemical oxidation and electrochemical 
methods  (Canizares et al., 2002; BelhadjTahara and Savall, 2009; Yavuz and Koparal, 2006 ), are the most 
widely used methods for removing phenol and phenolic compounds from wastewaters.  Problems  such as 
high expenses , low efficiency, and generation of toxic by -products are ass ociated with the above methods  
(Nazari et al. , 2007 ). Adsorption is a low cost and important physical process for the treatment and 
renovation of wastewater. It exploits the ability of certain solids to preferentially concentrate specific 
substance from so lution onto their surfaces. In this manner, the component of either gases or liquid 
solutions can be separated from each other. Various non -conventional adsorbents like saw dust, bagasse  
pith, rice husk ash, activated coconut shell powder, controlled burnt  wood charcoal, f ly ash, peat, wood, 
jute fibers have been tried by the investigators  (Kulkarni and Kaware , 2013). The parameters which have 
been investigated for optimizing the use of  nonconventional  adsorbents in wastewater treatment  include 
nature of ad sorbate and adsorbent,  adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose, contact time, pH of 
solution, particle size of adsorbent,  thermodynamic parameters,  etc. (Singh and Srivastava, 2002 ). The 
treatment with activate carbon, silicates and polymer  resins are cons idered to be an effective method for 
the removal of phenol from  wastewater because of its large surface area, micro porous nature, high 
adsorption  capacity, high purity and ease of  availability  (Radeke et al. , 1993). Phenol removal by 
adsorption process re mains the best treatment of choice as it can generally remove all types of phenols 
in a simple and easy operation. The adsorbent that is used in practice remains activated  carbon  (Jung et 
al., 2001). However because of high c ost of activated carbon, its us age is sometimes  restricted  due to  
economic considerations. As such, attempts have been made by many researchers  to develop alternative 
adsorbents, preferably of low cost. Literature survey shows that a large number of alternative adsorbents 
have been  stud ied to replace activated carbon. Both, the industrial wastes as well as some natural  
resource materials such as bentonite  (Banat et al. , 2000), olive mill waste  (Abdelkreem, 2013), pistachio 
nut shell ash (Bazrafshan et al. , 2012 c), coconut shell (Kulkarni  et al. , 2013), rubber seed coat  (Rengaraj 
et al. , 2002b), Moringa  peregrina  seed extract  (Bazrafshan et al. , 2012a), rice husk  and rice husk ash  
(Mahvi et al. , 2004), avocado  kernels  (Rodrigues et al. , 2011) have been  utilized for this purpose. Recently 
interest has turned to using various biomasses and agricultural wastes as biosorbent, which have the 
advantage of low cost and increased  tolerance of environmental conditions. Biosorption can be defined 
as a process in which  solids of natural origin are emp loyed for sequestration or separation of pollutants 
from  an aqueous environment  (Muraleedharan et al. , 1991). Many natural materials were used as 
biosorbent  for phenol removal, like wheat husk  (Jagwani and Joshi, 2014) jute stick (Mustafa et al. , 2008), 
tobacco residues  (Kilic et al. , 2011) and tamarind nutshell  (Goud et al. , 2005) , presented with  low cost  
viable options.  In this article, the use of activated carbon and various low  cost natural adsorbents for the 148  BAZRAFSHAN  E. et al.  
removal of phenolic compounds  from contamina ted effluents has  been  reviewed , reported  and 
evaluated . Instead of using commercial activated carbon, researchers have worked  on inexpensive 
adsorbents such as bentonite, biomass, fly ash, zeolites and other  natural  materials, which  have high 
adsorption c apacity and are locally available.  
 
2. Adsorption  of phenol and its derivatives  
 
In recent years literature surveys show that a large number of alternative adsorbents have been studied 
to replace activated carbon. The review presents the summary of the remova l of phenol and its derivatives  
by using following adsorbents by investigators in research work s (Table  1). Also the comparison of 
adsorption capacities for various phenolic compounds on adsorbents was shown in the Figure 1 .

Zarei et al. , (2013) , studied the efficiency of Moringa peregrina tree shell ash for the removal of phenol 
from aqueous sol utions; the examination was carried out in a batch system. According to the results of 
this study, it was found that the Moringa peregrina tree shell ash is not only a low -cost adsorbent but also 
has a high performance in the removal of phenol from aqueous  solutions (Zarei et al. , 2013). In another 
research, t he adsorption potential of pistachio -nut shell ash in a batch system w as studied by Bazrafshan 
et al.  (2012b)  for the removal of  phenol from aqueous solutions . The possibility of using rice husk and ri ce 
husk ash for removal of phenol from aqueous solution was investigated by Mahvi et al.  (2004). Activated 
carbon prepared from rubber seed coat (RSCC), an agricultural waste by -product has been used for the 
adsorption of phenol from aqueous solution by Re ngaraj et al.  (2002b ). Rao and Viraraghavan , (2002 ), 
have investigated the use of nonviable pretreated cells of Aspergillus niger to remove phenol from an 
aqueous solution. Five types of non -viable pretreated A. niger biomass powders were used as a biosorben t 
to remove phenol present in an aqueous solution at a concentration of 1000 g  l-1. Sulfuric acid pretreated 
A. niger biomass was found e ﬀective in the removal of phenol present in an aqueous solution at a 
concentration of 1000 g  l-1 (Rao and Viraraghavan,  2002 ). Findings of Tor et al.  (2006 ) on the application 
of neutralized red mud for removal of phenol from aqueous solution showed that the neutralized red mud 
was an effective adsorbent for the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions. Higher phenol remov al by 
neutralized red mud was possible provided that the initial phenol concent ration was low in the solution

analyzed the removal of phenol from aqueous solution by Adsorption on to Luffa cyli ndrical fibers (LC). 
Adsorption study for phenol removal from aqueous solution on activated palm seed coat carbon (PSCC) 
were carried out by Rengaraj et al.  (2002a ). A comparative study with a commercial activated carbon 
showed that PSCC is two times more effective than com mercial activated carbon (CAC) (Rengaraj et al. , 
2002a ). The vegetable sponge of cylindrical loofa, a natural product which rows in the north of Algeria, 
was used by Cherifi et al.  (2009 ). Abdelkreem  (2013)  explored the possibility of usi ng olive mill waste to 
remove phenol from aqueous effluents . The experimental studies on removal of phenol from waste water

Kulkarni et al.  (2013 ). Arris et al. (2012 ) showed that cereal by -product, an abundant natural material, can 
be used effectively and efficiently for the removal of phenol from wastewater . Rushdi et al.  (2011 ) showed 
that Jordanian zeolite  tuff can be used as a low cost adsorbent for the  removal of phenol from water. 
Another investigation of the use of three carbonaceous materials, activated carbon (AC), bagasse ash (BA) 
and wood charcoal (WC), as adsorbents was studied by Mukherjee et al.  (2007 ). Srivastava et al.  (2006 )

commercial grade (ACC) and laboratory grade (ACL). The present study showed that the bagasse ﬂy ash 
(BFA) is an effective adsorbent for the removal o f phenol from aqueous  solution (Srivastava et al. , 2006 ). 
Karatay and D onmez (2014 ) have carried out the research on an economical phenol bio -removal method 
using Aspergillus versicolor and agricultural wastes as a carbon source. Viraraghavan and Alfaro (1998 ) 
examined the eff ectiveness of less expensive adsorbents such as peat, fly ash and bentonite in removing 
phenol  from wastewater by adsorption. Batch adsorption research by Kilic et al.  (2011 ) for the removal of 
phenol from aqueous solutions have been carried out by using a ctivated carbon obtained from tobacco 
residue by chemical activation using K 2CO 3 and KOH as activation agents . A natural bentonite modiﬁed 
with a cationic surfactant, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), was used as an adsorbent for 
removal of phenol f rom aqueous solutions by Senturk et al.  (2009 ). Application of a chemically modiﬁed 
green macro alga as a bio sorbent for phenol removal  have carried out by Aravindhan et al.  (2009 ). The 
potential of bentonite for phenol adsorption from aqueous solutions wa s investigated by Banat et al.  
(2000 ). The removal of phenol (Ph) and 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CPh) from aqueous solution by native and heat 
inactivated fungus Funalia  trogii pellets investigated by Bayramoglu et al.  (2009 ). Batch adsorption

wastewater by addition of three apatites (porous hydroxyapatite (PHAp) and crystalline hydroxy l- (HAp) 
and ﬂuoroapatite (FAp).  The adsorption of phenol from aqueous solutions was investigated using a 
carbonized  beet pulp in the inert nitrogen atmosphere by Dursun et al.  (2005). Results in comparative 
studies on adsorptive removal of phenol by three  agro -based carbons, which have in vestigated by Srihari 
and Das (2008 ) showed that the black gram husk (BGH) is an effective adsorbent for the removal of phenol 
from aqueous solution when compared with green gram  husk (GGH) and rice husk (RH).  Activated ca rbons 
prepared from tamarind nutshell, an agricultural waste by -product, have been examined by Goud et al.  
(2005 ). Another Experiment have been conducted by Kermani et al.  (2006 ) to examine the adsorption of 
phenol from aqueous solutions by rice husk ash a nd g ranular activated carbon (GAC). Phenol removal 
from aqueous system by jute stick has studied by Mustafa et al.  (2008 ). In Siboni et al.  (2013 ) research  
activated red mud containing iron and calcium as major components was applied to treat synthetic  
wastewater in a batch reactor . In another research t he adsorption of phenol from wastewater was

4. Results and discussion  
 
4.1. Effect of initial pH on adsorption effectiveness  
pH of the solution is one of the most critical parameters that affect the chemical properti es of absorbin g 
and adsorbing (Saitoh et al.  2011).  The solution pH would affect both aqueous chemistry and surface 
binding sites of the adsorbent (Bazrafshan et al. , 2013 a). pH also affects the surface properties of the 
sorbent, i.e., surface charg e of th e cells used as sorbent ( Aksu and Yener, 2001). Nagda et al.  (2007 ) 
observed that the adsorption of phenol decreases by the increase of the pH value of the solution, which 
can be attributed to the phenol ionization to form phenolate ions and at the same ti me the presence of 
hydroxyl ions on the adsorbent prevents the uptake of phenolate ions (Halouli and Drawish, 1995 ). Similar 
trend  has been reported during the adsorption of phenol onto bentonite (Banat et al. , 2000 ). Hamid and 
Rahman (2008 ) defined the ph enol removal by Activated carbon derived from rattan sawdust (ACR) was 
maximum and unaffected when the initial pH  of the phenol solution was in the range of 3 -8. A similar 
trend of pH effect was observed for the adsorption of phenol on activated carbon -com mercial grade and 
laboratory grade  (Srivastava et al. , 2006 ). Generally,  solution pH affects the surface charge of adsorbent 
and degree of ionization of the adsorbate (Aksu and Kabasakal, 2003 ). Similar result was given by Liu and 
Pinto (1997 ) for granule and spherical activated carbon. They reported that, the decrease in phenol 
adsorption from pH = 6.3 to 3.07 was due to the increased H+ adsorption on the carbonyl sites, which 
suppresses phenol adsorption on these sites (Liu and Pinto, 1997 ). Similar trend  has been reported during 
the adsorption of phenol onto activated carbon by Ekpete et al.  (2010 ), onto rise husk by Mahvi et al.  
(2004 ) and onto agriculture waste by Tagreed (2010 ). Jagwani and Joshi (2014 ) concluded that adsorption  
amount decreased with i ncreasing pH value, which can be attributed to the phenol ionization to form 
phenolate ions and at the same time the presence of hydroxyl ions on the adsorbent prevents the uptake 
of phenolate ions (Halouli and Drawish, 1995). Similar behavior has been rep orted during the adsorption 
of phenol onto tendu leaf refuse and modified carbon prepared from tendu leaf refuse by Nagda et al.  
(2007 ).  
4.2. Effect of adsorbent dose on the phenol removal by adsorption process  
Because adsorption is mainly a surface pheno menon, the amount of surface availa ble for adsorption 
process and consequently the mass of adsorbent  can considerab ly affect adsorption efficiency 
(Bazrafshan et al. , 2014 ). In the investigation which was done by Rengaraj et al.  (2002b ) carbon dosage 
was v aried from 0.5 to 10 g and equilibrated for 24 h. It is evident that for the quantitative removal of 25 
mg l-1 of phenol in 100 ml, a minimum carbon dosage of 2.5 g RSCC and 3.0 g of CAC is required for 96% 
removal of phenol. The data clearly showed that t he RSCC is more effective than CAC for the removal of 
phenol.  Abdelkreem (2013 ) indicated that phenol removal increased quickly from 52% to 85% when the 
olive mill waste dosage increased from 0.25 g to 1 g and reached a maximum for 1 g olive mill waste. Th is 
trend is expected because as the adsorbent dose increases, the number of active sites for binding phenol 
molecules on the adsorbent increases and thus more phenol was attached to their surface. Thus it results 
in the increment of adsorption efficiency u ntil saturation. These results were agreed with those abstained 
by Ghaedi et al.  (2011 ), and Smithaa et al.  (2012 ). The minimum adsorbent dosage required was found by 
Srihari and Das (2008 ), they were 0.3, 0.35, and 0.4 g by BGH, GGH, and RH, respectively.  Thus, the 
adsorption trend of these agro based adsorbents was found to be in the following order: BGH>GGH>RH 
(Srihari and Das, 2008 ). Findings of Siboni et al. , (2013 ) work  indicated that the increase in phenol removal 
with increase in the activated red mu d amount is due to the increase of surface area and adsorption sites 
available for adsorption (Hameed and Rahman, 2008; Tor et al. , 2009a; Lin and Juang, 2009; Shirzad -Siboni APPLICATION OF ADSORPTION PROCESS  FOR PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS REMOVAL  151 
et al. , 2011). Similar observations have also been reported from other research gr oups (Mohd Din et al. , 
2009; Banat et al. , 2000; Tor et al. , 2006; Lin and Juang, 2009; Tor et al. , 2009b; Nayak and Singh, 2007).  
4.3. Effect of contact time on the phenol removal by adsorption process  
The contact time between adsorbate and adsorbent is o ne of the most important desi gn parameters that 
affect the performance of adsorption processes (Bazrafshan et al. , 2013 b; Bazrafshan et al. , 2015a ). The 
removal efficiency increased with time and attained equilibrium in 3 h for PSCC and 6 h for CAC for ini tial 
phenol concentration of 25 mg  l-1 In investigation on removal of phenol from aqueous solutions by 
activated red mud which has investigated by Siboni et al.  (2013 ), while increasing the phenol 
concentration from 40 to 80 mg  l-1, the removal percentage decreased from 90.3% to 76.6% at initial 30 
min of contact time. After that, the removal percentage of phenol slowly increased and ranged from 90.4% 
to 80.6% at three different phenol concentrations after 60 min. Further increase in the contact time has 
a negligible effect on the rate of phenol adsorption, and 60 min was determined as a near equilibration 
time (Siboni et al.  2013 ). The decrease in the removal percentage of phenol by increasing initial phenol 
concentration can be explained in that the adsorb ent had a limited number of active sites, which can be 
easily saturated at higher adsorbate concentration (Hameed and Rahman, 2008; Al -Asheh et al. , 2003; 
Tor et al. , 2006; Tor et al. , 2009). The results in Jagwani and Joshi (2014 ) research showed that equ ilibrium 
time required for the adsorption of phenol on wheat husk was almost 5hr. The results also indicated that 
the sorption process can be considered very fast because of the largest amount of phenol attached to the 
sorbent within the first 120 min of a dsorption as also observed by Mahvi et al.  (2004), Mustafa et al.  
(2008 ) and Kermani et al.  (2006 ). In addition similar findings were reported by other researchers about 
the increase of removal efficiency of pollutants with increase of contact time (Bazraf shan et al. , 2015b; 
Bazrafshan et al. , 2015c)  
4.4. Effect of initial phenol concentration on the effectiveness of adsorption process  
The initial concentration of pollutant provides an important driving force to overcome all mass transfer 
resistance of the adsorbate between the aqueous and solid phases (Anbia and Asl Hariri, 2010). Zarei et 
al. (2013 ) observed that phenol adsorption rate by Moringa peregrina tree shell ash will be increased by 
phenol concentration, so phenol eliminati on depends on its concen tration. The results in Dakhil (2013 ) 
research indicated that the percentage of phenol removal increases with increasing the adsorbent dose. 
The high sorption at the initial concentration (100 -500 mg  l-1) may be due to an increased number of 
vacant sites o n the adsorbent available at the initial stage. As concentration of initial phenol is increased 
there is a decrease in percentage removal of phenol. This can be attributed to the accumulation of phenol 
particles on the surface of adsorbent (Dakhil, 2013 ). This observation is in a good agreement with the 
findings of Ekpete et al.  (2010 ) and Mahvi et al.  (2004). 
4.5. Effect of temperature on phenol removal by adsorption process  
Temperature is an indicator for the adsorption nature whether it is an exothermic or endothermic process. 
Increasing temperature may decrease the adsorptive forces between the phenol species and the active 
sites on the adsorbent surface as a result of decreasing adsorption efficiency (Ofomaja and Ho, 2007; 
Jadhav and Vanjara, 2004). Senturk et al.  (2009 ) concluded that the uptake of phenol by organo bentonite 
decreased from 6.2 mg  g-1 (59% removal) to 5.2 mg  g-1 (49.5% removal) when increasing the temperature 
from 0 to 40  ̊C, which indicating that phenol uptake wa s favored at lower temperatures.  The decrease in 
adsorption with the rise of temperature may be due to the weakening of adsorptive forces between the 
active sites of the adsorbent and adsorbate species and also between the vicinal molecules of the 
adsorbed phase (Panday et al. , 1986; Mota and Lyubchik, 2008). Similar results were obtained by Hameed 
(2007 ) with adsorption of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol by act ivated clay.  
4.6. Adsorption isotherms  
Isotherms study can describe how an adsorbate interacts with the adsorbent. The isotherm provides a 
relationship between the concentration of phenol in solution and the amount of phenol adsorbed on the 
solid phase wh en both phases are in equilibrium (Anbia and Asl Hariri, 2010). The Langmuir, Freundlich, 152  BAZRAFSHAN  E. et al.  
Temkin, BET, Redlich -Peterson and Dubinin –Radushkevich (D -R) isotherm models were used to describe 
the relationship between the amount of phenol adsorbed and its equi librium concentration in solutions.  
Tor et al. , (2006 ) reported the R2 values for linear form of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are 0.988 
and 0.992, respectively. According to R2 values, the Freundlich isotherm best represents the equilibrium 
adsorption  of phenol on neutralized red mud. This result is attributed that various active sites or 
heterogeneous mixture of several minerals on neutralized red mud has different affinities to phenol 
molecule (Genç -Fuhrman et al. , 2004a; Genç -Fuhrman, 2004b). The we ll-known Freundlich, Langmuir 
isotherm equations were applied for the equilibrium adsorption data by Abdelkreem (2013 ) in the 
adsorption research of phenol from industrial wastewater using olive mill waste. The best -ﬁtted 
adsorption isotherm models by Rushdi et al.  (2011 ) were found to be in the order: Freundlich>Redlich –
eterson>Langmiur>Temkin for temperature range 25 -45 ̊C. 
4.7. Thermodynamic parameters in the adsorption process  
Thermodynamic parameters are the actual indicators to determine where a process proceeds 
spontaneously and to ascertain if the process has any practical use  (Nayak and Singh, 2007 ). The 
thermodyn amic parameters that must be considered to determine the adsorption processes are the 
changes in standard enthalpy (ΔH0), standard entropy (ΔS0), and standard free energy (ΔG0) due to 
transfer of unit mole of solute from solution onto the solid –liquid inte rface (Rushdi et al. , 2011 ). 
Adsorption process can be classified as physical adsorption and chemisorption by the magnitude of the 
enthalpy change. It is accepted that if magnitude of enthalpy change is lesser than 84 kJ  mol-1, then the 
adsorption is physi cal. However chemisorption takes place in the range of 84 -420 kJ  mol-1 (Bazrafshan  
et al. , 2015 d; Bazrafshan et al. , 2015 e). Also  If the process is endothermic (ΔH >0), the equilibrium 
constant increases wi th temperature and If the process  is exothermic (Δ H <0), the  equilibrium constant 
decreases as temperature is raised (Cherifi et al. , 2009 ). The thermodynamic parameters are prese nted 
in Table 2.  
Abdelwahab and Amin (2013 ) reported that the standard Gibbs free energies  (ΔG0) of adsorption were 
negative at all investigated temperatures.  The negative values of ΔG0 of the adsorption confirmed  that 
the adsorption of phenol onto LC was feasible and spontaneous  (Fu et al. , 2009; Su et al. , 2011 ). Similar 
results were reported in the literature for the  adsorption of phenol by organomontmorillonit (Fu et al. , 
2009 ) and adsorption of phenol onto chemically modified activated  carbon (Canizare s et al. , 2006 ) and 
adsorption of phenol onto solid waste products from olive oil industry ( Bhatnagar et al. , 2014 ). Rushdi et 
al. (2011 ) reported that  the Negative ΔG0 values are obtained at all temperatures revealing  the 
spontaneous nature of these adsorptions. Generally, the  values are close to each other indicating that 
such spontaneity is  independent on the temperat ure where the adsorption occurs ( Okolo et al. , 2000). It 
is also supposed that the change of ΔS0 value  is related to the displacement of the adsorbed water 
molecules by  the adsorbate  (Li et al. , 2005) . In this study, the negative ΔS0 value may reveal that  zeolite 
surface does not prefer phenol molecules  over adsorbed  water molecules. Thus, the adsorption of phenol 
onto zeolite  under employed conditions is considered as an enthalpy driven  process (Bhatnagar and 
Sillanpaa, 2010 ). 
 
5. Conclusion s 
 
Chemical contamination of water from a wide range of toxic poll utants, especially aromatic molecules, is 
a serious environmental problem due to potential human and environmental toxicity. Phenol and its 
derivatives appear to be the major organic pollutants globally in this century. They derived from many 
chemical plan ts and pesticide and dye manufacturing industries and cause serious threat to human health 
and to natural water. Adsorption is relatively new practice for the removal of phenol and its derivatives. 
In this article the role of activated carbon for the remov al of phenol and its derivatives from water and 
wastewater was discussed. It is only able to remove few milligrams of phenol and its derivatives per gram 
of activated carbon and there are still some problems encountered in the regeneration process. This 
makes activated carbon an expensive adsorbent for this aim. Therefore, low -cost materials are needed APPLICATION OF ADSORPTION PROCESS  FOR PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS REMOVAL  153 
that are comparable to activated carbon or synthetic resins in terms of adsorption capacity and should be 
locally available. The present review shows that se veral adsorbents (pistachio nut shell ash, Moringa 
peregrina tree shell ash, agricultural fibers, red mud, low cost clay and etc.) have equivalent or even more 
adsorption capacity to activated carbon and synthetic resins. It should be kept in mind that eco nomic 
aspects are important. As an example, biosorption were found to be effective methods with scope for 
further research in this field in terms of cost effectiveness and regeneration.  The alternative adsorbents 
mentioned in this article are found to be h ighly efficient for the removal of phenol and its derivatives. This 
is highly valuable for, not only the industries but the living organisms and the surrounding environment 
since they would be benefited from the potential toxicity. Thus the use of low -cost adsorbents may 
contribute to the sustainability of the surrounding environment. However, despite the number of 
published laboratory data, non -conventional low -cost adsorbents have not been applied at an industrial 
scale.  Undoubtedly low -cost adsorbents of fer a lot of promising benefits for c ommercial purpose in the 
future and the development of the adsorption process  requires further investigation in the direction of 
testing low  cost adsorbents  with real industrial effluents. So there  is a particular need for future studies 
to verify the performance of the promising low -cost adsorbents at the pilot plant scale.
