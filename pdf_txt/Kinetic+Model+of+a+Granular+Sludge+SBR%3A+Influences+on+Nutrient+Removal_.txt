Simulation ABSTRACT  
In this study a mathematical framework was developed to describe aerobic granulation based on 6 main 
mechanisms: microbial selection, selective wasting, maximizing transport of substrate into the biofilm, selective 
feeding, substrate type and breakage. A numerical model was developed using four main components; a 1D 
convection/dispersion model to describe the flow dynamics in a reactor, a reaction/diffusion model describing 
the essential conversions for granule growth, a setting model to track granules during settling and feeding, and a 
population model containing up to 100,000 clusters of granules to model the stochastic behaviour of the 
granulation process. With this approach the model can explain the dynamics of the granulation process observed 
in practice. This includes the presence of a lag phase and a granulation phase. Selective feeding was identified as 
an important mechanism that was not yet reported in literature. When aerobic granules are grown from activated 
sludge flocs, a lag phase occurs, in which not many granules are formed, followed by a granulation phase in 
which granules rapidly appear. The ratio of granule forming to non-granule forming substrate together with the 
feast/famine ratio determine if the transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase is successful. The 
efficiency of selective wasting and selective feeding both determine the rate of this transition. Brake-up of large 
granules into smaller well settling particles was shown to be an important source for new granules. The gran-
ulation process was found to be the combined result from all 6 mechanisms and if conditions for either one are 
not optimal, other mechanisms can, to some extent, compensate. This model provides a theoretical framework to 
analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge formation and can form the basis for a 
comprehensive model that includes detailed nutrient removal aspects.   
1.Introduction 
Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a technology for biological treat-
ment of domestic and industrial wastewater. Microbial aggregates of 
aerobic granular sludge are large compared to conventional activated 
sludge, allowing for a more efficient treatment process. Although the 
technology was invented more than 20 years ago (Heijnen and van 
Loosdrecht, 1998; Morgenroth et al., 1997 ) and the first full-scale ap-
plications treating sewage started to appear from 2005 under the trade 
name Nereda ® (Giesen et al., 2013 ), there is no consensus in literature 
on the underlying mechanisms for aerobic granulation and the process is 
influenced by many factors (Winkler et al., 2018 ). Factors often 
described are hydrodynamic shear (Liu and Tay, 2002; Tay et al., 2001; 
Wu et al., 2020 ), physical selection on settling velocity (van Dijk et al., 
2020; McSwain et al., 2004 ), the flow regime during contact of the sludge with influent (Haaksman et al., 2022; Lochmatter and Holliger, 
2014; Rockt aschel et al., 2013 ), dissolved oxygen concentration (Mos-
quera-Corral et al., 2005 ), feast/famine ratio (Beun et al., 2002; Cofr˘e 
et al., 2018; de Kreuk and van Loosdrecht, 2004 ), influent substrate 
composition (Layer et al., 2019; Pronk et al., 2015a ), organic loading 
rate (Iorhemen and Liu, 2021 ), quorum sensing (Wang et al., 2017 ) and 
aggregation through EPS (Liu et al., 2010 ). It is unclear which factors 
matter most and how their interplay is affected by the process conditions 
applied. A framework for biofilm morphology has been proposed 
(Picioreanu et al., 1998 ), but this framework only explains granule 
stability on the micro-scale, but it cannot explain granulation dynamics 
on a reactor scale. For anaerobic granular sludge, such a framework has 
been developed (Beeftink and van den Heuvel, 1990 ), but this frame -
work is not as such applicable for aerobic granular sludge. 
When a AGS reactor is seeded with activated sludge, under the right 
circumstances, granular sludge will develop from flocculent sludge. In

2practice this granulation process shows dynamics that are not easily 
explained. The granulation process commonly has a lag phase, in which 
not much change in the granulation grade (biomass fraction of the 
granules) seems to happen. Secondly, there is the granulation phase, in 
which granules start to appear in the reactor and the granulation grade 
increases (Fig. 1). The reason behind the lag phase and the trigger for the 
sudden start of granulation is unclear. We hypothesize that there are six 
main mechanisms that are of most importance for successful granulation 
(Fig. 2). 
Microbial selection is important for the formation of granules. It has 
been shown that a stable dense biofilm can be best achieved, when the 
uptake rate of substrates is lower than the transport rate of the substrates 
into the granules (Van Loosdrecht et al., 2002 ). Therefore, the process is 
optimized towards organisms that anaerobically sequester readily 
biodegradable substrate by converting it into storage polymers and 
subsequently utilizing these polymers for aerobic growth (de Kreuk and 
van Loosdrecht, 2004; Nicholls and Osborn, 1979; Smolders et al., 
1994 ). This effectively separates the substrate uptake and the growth 
into two processes (called feast and famine). Phosphate accumulating 
organisms (PAO) and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAO) are ex-
amples of species that can make this split and these organisms are 
commonly observed in full-scale aerobic granular sludge processes (Ali 
et al., 2019 ). Not all substrates can be sequestered anaerobically into 
storage polymers for aerobic growth of bacteria in the granules. We call 
these substrates, non-granule forming substrates (n-GFS). Substrates that 
can lead to growth of aerobic granules (e.g. volatile fatty acids, but also 
readily biodegradable substrates that can be converted anaerobically) 
we call granule forming substrates (GFS). 
Physical selection is also an important driver for growing aerobic 
granular sludge (Beun et al., 2002; de Kreuk and van Loosdrecht, 2004; 
Morgenroth et al., 1997; Qin et al., 2004 ). AGS has advantageous 
settling properties compared to activated sludge flocs (Heijnen and van 
Loosdrecht, 1998; Morgenroth et al., 1997 ). In AGS reactors flocs will 
always be present to some extent (Pronk et al., 2015b ) as not all carbon 
sources present in sewage can be converted to storage polymers during anaerobic feeding (Layer et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is needed to pref-
erentially remove the flocculent sludge fraction with the excess sludge to 
give granules a competitive advantage. This is achieved by using the 
differential settling velocity between flocculent and granular sludge 
(van Dijk et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2005 ). This is called the physical se-
lection pressure. 
Another well-known driver is maximizing transport of substrate into 
the biofilm. Higher substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid result in a 
deeper penetration of the substrate in the biofilm (Arvin and Harre -
moes, 1990 ). This helps to grow and support a thicker biofilm. In AGS 
reactors a higher substrate concentration is achieved by either pulse 
feeding at the start (Beun et al., 2002 ) or more practical relevant by 
plug-flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor (de Kreuk and van 
Loosdrecht, 2004; Pronk et al., 2015b ). This gives a competitive 
advantage for larger granules. Larger granules settle faster than smaller 
granules and flocs, and therefore accumulate at the bottom of the settled 
sludge bed (van Dijk et al., 2020 ). Feeding from the bottom therefore 
results in a longer contact time with the influent and contact with higher 
substrate concentrations for the larger granules. As a result, they will 
have more opportunity for growth than smaller fraction. Hence the term 
selective feeding . 
Aerobic granules go through a typical life cycle that has a strong 
influence on the granulation process and reactor performance. When an 
AGS reactor is seeded with activated sludge flocs, these flocs will first 
form proto-granules. Flocs and proto-granules share similar bulk settling 
properties. An important difference is that the proto-granules already 
have the granular morphology but are smaller than 200 µm, which is 
considered to be the minimum size for an aggregate to be called an 
aerobic granule (de Kreuk et al., 2007a ). Proto-granules already have 
been observed in conventional activated sludge processes, especially in 
systems with high anaerobic food to mass ratios, unmixed in-line 
fermentation, and a high influent soluble COD fraction (Wei et al., 
2020 ). Proto-granules are embedded in the floc matrix and settle 
together with the flocculent material.

3conversions in flocs, because the small radius of the proto-granules al-
lows for full penetration with oxygen. Simultaneous nitrification and 
denitrification (SND) thus will be limited to very low DO conditions. 
When proto-granules grow out into small granules (F200 µm), these 
small granules will settle significant faster and independent of the 
flocculent mass. The result is that small granules can experience the 
benefits regarding sludge selection, remain longer in the reactor with 
selective wasting and receive more influent with bottom feeding. When 
the granules continue to grow, the biofilm kinetics become more pro-
nounced and full penetration of oxygen is less likely and SND will in-
crease. Large granules (F1000 µm) are more susceptible to breakage (de 
Graaff et al., 2020 ). When a granule breaks into smaller pieces some will 
be spilled and others will become a seed for new granules, restarting the 
granule life cycle. Thus we hypothesized that breakage of granules is an 
integral part of the granulation process, similar as proposed for anaer -
obic sludge (Beeftink and van den Heuvel, 1990 ). 
The aforementioned factors for aerobic granulation are not absolute. For example, only part of the substrate of domestic wastewater can be 
taken up anaerobically by the AGS directly or after fermentation. Still, it 
is possible to grow AGS on the complex composition of domestic 
wastewater (Layer et al., 2019; Pronk et al., 2015b ). The selection 
pressure applied in full-scale reactors will be less effective than in 
lab-reactors, because of less favourable H/D ratios and other scaling 
factors. Apparently, the favourable mechanisms can be allowed to be 
non-optimally implemented to a certain extent without harming the 
granulation process. It is however unclear, how the different mecha -
nisms influence one another positively or negatively if the process 
conditions become less favourable. 
Analysis of the quantitative interplay between the aforementioned 
mechanisms in combination with varying process conditions requires a 
mathematical modelling approach. A mature granular bed in practice 
exists of a collection of granules with sizes up to 5 mm (van Dijk et al., 
2020 ). For the purpose of this study, a framework was required in which 
the lifecycle of granules could be tracked. Simulated granules should be

4allowed to have different time-variable spatial positions in the reactor 
and should be exposed to different bulk-liquid conditions, within a cycle 
and from one cycle to the next. This approach is required to capture the 
stochastic properties of an AGS system. Several models are available 
describing the AGS process with different emphases (Baeten et al., 
2019 ). Models that describe granulation as the development of a char-
acteristic mean granule size (Ni et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2004 ) or assume 
a single granule size to study, for example, microbial speciation in 
granules and nutrient removal (de Kreuk et al., 2007b; Xavier et al., 
2007 ) are not suitable for the purpose of this study. The same holds for 
models that assume successful granulation using a fixed granule size 
distribution to investigate reactor performance (Dold et al., 2019; Layer 
et al., 2020 ). Models with a dynamic granule size distribution (Beeftink 
and van den Heuvel, 1990; Li and Li, 2009 ) often use a population 
balance model (PBM) to describe the number of granules in a certain size 
class and the processes that influence these amounts (i.e. growth and 
detachment) via transitions from or to another size class. However, the 
available PBMs are only suited for completely mixed reactors, not for 
typical AGS reactors with combined spatial and temporal differences 
between the conditions experienced by aggregates. We hypothesized 
that the process for aerobic granulation can be described by six mech -
anisms (Fig. 2) with a minimal required description of the biological 
conversions, tracking the development of individual granule clusters in 
the reactor over time. 
In this study, we aimed to understand the underlying principles for 
aerobic granulation. A mathematical model was constructed that de-
scribes the full life cycle of aerobic granules. We performed a sensitivity 
analysis on the six mechanisms proposed and we evaluated their indi-
vidual contribution to the granulation process. 
2.Methodology 
A model was developed integrating several sub-models describing all 
the proposed mechanisms responsible for the granulation process. The 
main process steps in current full-scale AGS reactors according to the 
Nereda ® concept are the feeding phase, in which fresh influent is fed to 
the reactor from the bottom, the reaction phase, where the wastewater is 
cleaned by different aeration strategies and finally the settling and 
decanting phase, in which the selective wasting takes place. In full-scale 
applications feeding and effluent decanting happens simultaneously 
(Giesen et al., 2013; Pronk et al., 2015b ). 2.1. Theoretical background 
2.1.1. Biomass morphology 
The morphology of biofilms is dependent on a combination of con-
vection, diffusion, reaction, growth and detachment (Picioreanu et al., 
2000a ). All biomass clusters are assumed to have constant smooth and 
spherical morphology with a constant density. This specific biofilm 
morphology occurs when substrate uptake is limited by the maximum 
biomass specific uptake rate and not by transport (Picioreanu et al., 
2000b ). Since substrate uptake (anaerobic) is uncoupled from growth 
(aerobic) in full-scale AGS, a smooth, spherical biofilm morphology was 
assumed for all simulations. Wherever the distinction is made between 
flocs and granules, this is solely based on the sludge particle diameter. 
The smallest particles of 100 µm are referred to as flocs, while all larger 
particles are considered (proto-)granules. 
2.1.2. Microbial ecology 
The microbial population differs over the radius of the biofilm due to 
concentration gradients of substrates (Picioreanu et al., 1998 ). Different 
organisms present in the biofilm are responsible for processes like 
nitrification, denitrification and phosphate removal (de Kreuk et al., 
2005; Winkler et al., 2013 ). However, since the aim of this study was to 
investigate the impact of the different mechanisms on the growth of 
aerobic granules, the biomass clusters are assumed to have constant 
ecology. Furthermore, biomass formation in wastewater treatment 
plants is mostly related to COD conversions. No nitrogen and phos-
phorus conversions are considered in the model as they contribute 
marginally to biomass formation. All modelled biomass can store COD 
anaerobically as storage polymers. Therefore, only the conversions of 
COD into storage polymers, and storage polymers into biomass, were 
simulated to describe granular growth. 
2.1.3. Biological fate of COD-types in wastewater 
The chemical oxygen demand (COD) present in domestic wastewater 
can be divided in multiple fractions (Henze, 1992 ). These fractions can 
be divided based on the availability for biological conversions (Layer 
et al., 2019 ). The soluble and suspended inert COD and inorganic solids 
are not available for any biological conversion and are thus disregarded 
in this model. Both the soluble readily biodegradable COD and the 
colloid fast hydrolysable COD are available for anaerobic conversion 
into storage polymers and are thus categorized as GFS. The suspended 
slowly hydrolysable COD is available for biological conversions, but not

5for anaerobic storage and are categorized as n-GFS. A schematic repre -
sentation is shown in Fig. 4. 
2.2. Model description 
2.2.1. Components 
Four mathematical models were combined to perform a sensitivity 
analysis on the hypothesized main mechanisms for aerobic granulation 
(see also Fig. 4). The four model components are described below (a 
more detailed description can be found in the appendix).  
1. Cluster-based biomass population model : An AGS reactor typically 
contains a dynamic distribution of granule sizes, all of different age, 
shape and ecology. To capture the probability of granules of similar 
size to be at the different locations in the reactor at the same time, a 
cluster-based approach was used. The sludge population was dis-
cretized into clusters of aggregates with the same diameter, where 
each simulated cluster represented the same amount of physical 
biomass in the reactor. The amount of biomass represented by a 
cluster scaled linearly with the surface area of the simulated reactor, 
since the spatial gradients in an AGS reactor are mainly 1D (i.e. over 
the height). A convergence analysis showed that a discretization of 
1.75 ×10 2 simulated mass per real mass per reactor area (kg/kg/ 
m2) yielded a discretization-independent solution. This resulted in 
⊃10,000 clusters at start-up in the reference case with only flocs of 
100 µm, and the population increased to ⊃100,000 upon successful 
granulation. New clusters were formed from n-GFS as clusters with a 
diameter of 100 µm. The clusters could be subjected to the following 
mechanisms:  
≡Growth: in the reaction phase, the diameter of each cluster of 
particles grew according to the amount of PHA formed during the 
anaerobic feeding phase. This resulted in a different increase in 
volume for each cluster of granules. The increase was based on an 
apparent yield coefficient (including decay) and a constant 
biomass concentration in the granule, resulting in a constant VSS/ 
TSS ratio. All PHA was assumed to be consumed and converted to new biomass, without any time dependence in the reaction phase 
(see Appendix B).  
≡Breakage: the larger aerobic granules become, the more likely they 
will break up into smaller pieces (de Graaff et al., 2020 ). In the 
model, granule clusters larger than 3 mm have an increasing 
chance of breaking (increasing to 99% for granules larger than 5 
mm). Breakage leads to two clusters with random diameter be-
tween 100 µm and the original diameter, with a combined biomass 
equal to the original cluster (see Appendix B).  
≡Redistribution: if a cluster of granules exceeded the maximum 
amount of represented real biomass, it was split into two clusters of 
granules with same diameter. Each cluster would represent half of 
the original biomass.  
≡Wasting: Biomass discharge from the reactor was performed by the 
removal of number of complete clusters. Clusters were selected, 
depending on the wasting method used (a mixed sample for MLSS 
control or based on settling velocity for selective wasting).  
2. Bulk-liquid solute mass balance : the anaerobic feeding in an AGS 
sequencing-batch reactor (SBR) is mainly a 1D process, since reactors 
are fed from the bottom and the process is designed to get an optimal 
plug-flow. Some axial mixing does occur (van Dijk et al., 2018 ). 
Therefore, the concentration profile of GFS during feeding was 
described by an 1D convection-dispersion model (Degaleesan and 
Dudukovic, 1998; van Dijk et al., 2018 ). It was solved with one-way 
coupling to the settling model, since during the feeding phase 
granules will still be settling and partially fluidize. The calculated 
effective voidage is thus dynamic and will hence influence the local 
fluid velocity.  
3. Biofilm solute mass balance : The flux of GFS into a granule depends on 
the local concentration in the bulk-liquid surrounding the granule 
and the rate of mass transfer, which varies over the height of the 
reactor. It is in turn affected by the rate of diffusion in the granules 
and rate of reaction of GFS to PHA. Furthermore, anaerobic storage 
capacity of PHA is limited by a maximum PHA content, used as a 
simplification for depletion of glycogen (de Kreuk et al., 2007b ). The 
dynamic mass balances of GFS and PHA were modelled using a 1D 
radial reaction-diffusion model for each cluster of particles, solved

6fully coupled to the bulk-liquid mass balance. The combined pro-
cesses in the bulk-liquid phase, biofilm phase and the settling model 
determined the total amount of storage polymer per cluster of 
granule after the feeding phase.  
4. Settling model : the settling velocity of a granule depends on the 
physical properties of the granule (i.e. size and density) and the 
biomass concentration in the near vicinity of the granule. As a result, 
every granule will have a unique settling velocity, eventually 
determining the position in the reactor during feeding. To describe 
this settling behaviour, we used the Van Dijk settling model (van Dijk 
et al., 2020 ) and adapted it to describe the settling and fluidization of 
clusters of granules. The model was also adapted to better describe 
the settling of flocs and proto-granules. The latter involved a change 
in the calculation of the expansion index, which is now calculated 
based on the Archimedes number. 
2.2.2. Cycle build-up 
A typical Nereda ® cycle was simulated in the model. This typical cycle has a duration of 6 h, and consists of 60 min of anaerobic feeding 
and decanting, 270 min of reaction time, and 30 min for settling and 
wasting of biomass. These typical values could vary in the scenario ’s. 
Fig. 3 shows the different processes being modelled in the different 
phases of the cycle. 
2.3. Size distribution 
The granule size distribution of the sludge in the Nereda ® reactor 
used as reference in Fig. 1 was measured over time. To determine the 
granule size distribution 1 L of sample was poured over a series of sieves 
with different mesh sizes (212, 425, 630, 1000, 1400 and 2000 µm). A 
mixed sample of 100 mL was filtered for the determination of the total 
dry weight. The obtained granular biomass of the different sieve frac-
tions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 ∘C until no change in 
weight was detected anymore. Then the sieve fractions are grouped 
together: small granules are the sum of 212, 425 and 630 µm, large 
granules are the sum of 1000, 1400 and 2000 µm and the concentration Table 1

granule fractions from the concentration of the mixed sample. 
3.Results and discussion 
A sensitivity analysis was done to compare the influence of the major 
mechanisms on the granulation process. The main results for all sce-
narios are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 5. 
3.1. Reference case 
A reference case was defined and the different scenarios in the 
sensitivity analysis were compared to this reference case. The reference 
case was a full-scale reactor with a water depth of 6 m, that was seeded 
with 2 g L 1 of flocs of 100 µm. The selection pressure at the start was 3 
m h 1 and it was slowly increased whenever the sludge concentration 
reached 3.0 g L 1. The reactor was fed from the bottom of the reactor, 
with a P˘eclet number of 250. The exchange ratio was 25% and there 
were no rain weather conditions, or other variation to the influent flow 
or composition. The reactor was fed four batches per day, containing 
500 mg L 1 of COD, which was composed of 200 mg L 1 granule 
forming substrate and 300 mg L 1 non-granule forming substrate. The feeding time was 60 min. Feeding and decanting was done simulta -
neously, as is normal for full-scale AGS installations. 
For analyses the particles in the reactor are classified in three main 
types: the proto granules , which are particles in the range of 100 to 200 
µm. These particles have the granular morphology, but settling behav -
iour is floc-like, so they are not able to separate from the sludge matrix. 
Flocs are mathematically treated similar to the proto-granules, because 
they both have the same floc-like behaviour. In the model a floc is 
represented by particles of 100 µm and smaller. Small granules are par-
ticles in the range of 200 to 1000 µm. These particles (larger than 200 
µm) are aerobic granules according to the definition of AGS (de Kreuk 
et al., 2007a ). These granules settle better than the proto-granule frac-
tion and are small enough to be fully penetrated with substrate (acetate 
and oxygen). Particles larger than 1000 µm are called large granules . 
These granules settle very quickly and accumulate near the bottom of 
the reactor during the feeding phase. Large granules are large enough to 
only be partially penetrated with substrates. 
The granulation process in the reference case is shown in Fig. 5. Since 
the reactor is seeded with particles of 100 µm, it takes time before the 
first small granules appear in the reactor. All proto-granules have the 
same bulk-like settling behaviour, so selective wasting has no effect yet. 
This means every particle has the same chance of being wasted. Until

coefficient (0 for equal distribution, 1 of complete unequal distribution).

8this point the growth of the granules is based on chance. The proto- 
granules will not not receive substrate every cycle. The substrate load 
depends on the position in the sludge bed, the volumetric exchange ratio 
and the amount of sequestered substrate by the particles beneath it. Over 
the course of multiple cycles, the combination of these factors will 
determine whether a proto-granule will receive enough substrate to 
grow into a small granule before it is spilled. 
After 90 d the first small granules appear and these granules settle 
faster than the proto-granules. This gives these granules a competitive 
advantage: the granules will be fed more frequently, because they settle 
towards the bottom of the reactor. This can be seen as a race towards the 
substrate. The fastest settling granule will always win the race and can 
take up a maximum amount of substrate. On top of this, the fastest 
settling granule will also be spilled less likely in the selective wasting 
from the top of the settled sludge bed. Larger granules therefore have a 
double benefit: they receive more substrate and they are less likely to be 
spilled. This process is also visible in Fig. 5: small granules dominate the 
population in the reactor a few weeks after the first small granules 
appeared. 
In the simulation the first large granules appear after 165 d. These 
granules have better settling properties then the small granules, the 
largest ones having settling velocities well over 100 m h 1. This means 
the large granules will reach the bottom of the reactor in several minutes 
and they will be fed every cycle. The chance of being spilled through 
selective wasting is close to zero, because the settling velocity of large 
granules is much larger than the maximum applied selection pressure of 
6 m h 1. This is a matter of the winner takes it all. The large granules will 
accumulate most of the granule forming substrate (Fig. 6), essentially 
leading to the extinction of the proto-granules. 
The end of the lag phase is defined as the moment the biomass 
concentration increases more than 10% above the target concentration 
of 3 g L 1. This means the maximum selection pressure of 6 m h 1 is 
reached and due to the increasing amount of granules, the biomass 
concentrations keeps increasing. The reference case has a lag phase of 
193 d. The end of the lag phase marks the start of the granulation phase, 
which ends when the target biomass concentration of 8 g L 1 is reached. 
Hereafter the biomass concentration is kept on 8 g L 1 through mixed 
wasting in the aeration phase. The duration of the granulation phase was 
58 d (see Table 1). 
The granulation process in the reference case is very similar to what 
is observed in practice (Fig. 1). It shows a similar apparent steady state 
in the lag phase after which large granules appear in the granulation 
phase. Granulation in practice shows a bit more variation due to pro-
cesses that are not taken into account in the model, such as rain weather 
events, load variations and temperature variations, but the overall 
process compares well. 
3.2. Microbial selection 
The effect of changing feast/famine conditions was shown by 
shortening the anaerobic feeding time, thus limiting the anaerobic up-
take of granule forming substrate. Since the batch size (and thus the 
loading rate) was kept constant, shortening the feeding time resulted in 
a higher feed flow velocity. In the reference case the anaerobic feeding 
time was 60 min, which was reduced to 30 min and 15 min. The shorter 
feeding time has a clear effect on the duration of the lag phase, which 
was 193 d in the reference case and was increased to 290 d in the case 
with a 15 min feeding phase (Table 1). The granulation phase was a bit 
faster, when the feeding phase was shortened, reducing from 58 to 42 d. 
The final granule size distribution after 365 d was quite similar. 
The difference in the lag phase is a consequence of the higher up-flow 
velocity and the shorter contact time in the scenarios. A consequence of 
the higher up-flow velocity is a larger sludge bed expansion, leading to 
less proto-granules in contact with the influent. The shorter contact time 
also leads to less uptake of substrate by the particles. As a result, less proto-granules grow towards small granules due to the more even dis-
tribution of the residual granule forming substrate left over after the 
feeding phase. 
In the granulation phase the bed expansion is not an issue anymore, 
because small granules can settle faster than flocs and proto-granules. 
So, the substrate-rich influent is more effectively in contact with the 
largest granule size fraction. The higher up-flow velocity causes a dis-
tribution of the GFS to be more skewed towards the small granules. As a 
result small granules are converted into larger granules more quickly, 
slightly reducing length of the granulation phase. 
Overall, the duration of the feast period is especially important in the 
lag phase, which is shortened by a longer feast period at equal daily 
volumetric loading rates. In the granulation period, the duration of the 
feast period is of less importance and might even provide a means to 
control the granule size distribution. 
3.3. Selective wasting 
The contribution of selective wasting to the aerobic granulation 
process was shown by switching from selective wasting to mixed 
wasting. In selective wasting the slowest settling biomass is removed 
from the top of the sludge bed, while faster settling particles remain in 
the reactor. In mixed wasting, the biomass concentration is kept con-
stant by wasting both fast and slow settling biomass, all particles having 
the same chance to get wasted. The mixed wasting is representative for 
the situation in a conventional activated sludge process. The biomass 
was wasted to maintain a concentration of 3 g L 1. This mixed wasting 
did not lead to a significant granular fraction, although after 98 d the 
first small granules appeared in the reactor. Some large granules were 
present at the end of the simulation, although their contribution was 
small (0.3 g L 1) and with insufficient effect on the settleability to allow 
for an increase in MLSS. 
This scenario clearly shows the importance of selective wasting, 
because without it significant granulation does not happen. It also shows 
the drive towards granulation from the other mechanisms in the reactor. 
Although the granules are not preferentially maintained in the reactor as 
they are randomly wasted, new granules are constantly formed, due to 
spread in anaerobic distribution of GFS. This might explain, why (small) 
granules are observed in many conventional activated sludge systems 
(Wei et al., 2020 ). Even without selective wasting, some growth of 
granules can happen, when the other drivers for granulation are suffi-
ciently present in the reactor. However, selective wasting is essential to 
drive the sludge towards full granulation. 
3.4. Concentration gradients 
To show the positive effect of upwards plug-flow feeding on the 
granule formation, in the simulation the plug-flow feeding was removed. 
The reactor was changed into an ideally mixed reactor during the 
feeding period. In full-scale AGS reactor feeding and decanting is done 
simultaneously, which is possible because of the plug-flow (van Dijk 
et al., 2018 ). When the reactor would be ideally mixed during feeding, 
biomass would wash-out, resulting in poor effluent quality. For a good 
comparison between the scenarios, in the simulation biomass was not 
allowed to leave the reactor with the effluent. The results show a strong 
shift towards smaller granules. Compared to the reference case the 
duration of the lag phase was only slightly longer (205 d compared to 
193 d). Also, the duration of granulation phase was very similar. The 
real difference is visible in the granule size distribution at the end of the 
simulation. Without the plug flow feeding, no large granules appeared in 
the reactor and the average granule size was 703 µm (compared to 1371 
µm in the reference case). 
This shift towards smaller granules is caused by several different 
processes. Lower substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid limit the 
diffusion depth of substrate into the granules. This results in slower E.J.H. van Dijk et al.

9granule growth. Also, all substrate is distributed evenly over all parti-
cles, where in the reference case the best settling fraction receives most 
of the substrate. Pilot-scale work with anaerobic pulse-feeding of 
municipal wastewater showed a smaller mean granule size compared to 
the plug-flow of full-scale bottom-fed reactors (Rockt aschel et al., 2015 ). 
Because the other mechanisms for granulation are still present (micro -
bial selection, selective wasting and granule forming substrate), the 
system can still achieve a high granulation grade, but only with small 
granules. 
3.5. Selective feeding 
The effect of the selective feeding was shown by removing the dif-
ferences in settling velocity between the different particle sizes during 
the feeding phase. As a result, all particles have the same chance to be 
exposed to substrate, regardless of their settling properties, while the 
concentration gradient resulting from the plug-flow was kept intact. The 
effect is most noticeable in the duration of the lag phase, which takes 
275 d compared to 193 d in the reference case. The duration of granu -
lation phase is comparable with the reference case, but the granulation 
phase starts without any large granules present. In the end the average 
granule size is slightly smaller than in the reference case. This outcome 
indicates that whether a system transitions from the lag phase to the 
granulation phase is not only determined by the formation of some small 
granules that settle faster than proto-granules and flocs. The ability to 
exploit the faster settling properties of small granules for the uptake of 
GFS is key in accelerating the transition from the lag-phase to the 
granulation-phase and of the granulation phase itself. 
The selective feeding can thus be seen as a race to the substrate: the 
best settling granules will have the longest exposure to the substrate and 
will see the highest concentration gradients. Because the settling prop-
erties of granules get better as they get larger, selective feeding allows 
for an increase substrate utilization with an increasing granule size. 
Removing selective feeding from the simulation shows, as expected, a 
shift towards smaller granules. Although in the end large granules still 
appear in the reactor, selective feeding is an important driver for gran-
ulation, which has not been recognized before in literature. 
3.6. Granule forming substrate 
In the model non-granule forming substrate will always lead to the 
formation of flocs and granule forming substrate can lead to the for-
mation of granules, if it is converted into storage polymers. Especially in 
the lag phase the ratio between GFS and n-GFS will influence the chance 
of proto-granules to grow into small granules. When too many flocs are 
formed compared to the growth of the proto-granules, the proto- 
granules will get spilled before they grow into small granules and can 
preferentially be retained in the reactor. This is clearly shown in the 
scenario where the GFS was reduced from 200 mg L 1 to 100 mg L 1 (i.e. 
decreased from 40% to 20% of the influent COD). Under these condi -
tions the lag phase does not finish in the 365 d of simulation. Although 
some small granules appear in the reactor (the maximum granule size is 
736 µm), the average granule size is only 110 µm and the simulation 
clearly shows a shift towards flocs in the lag phase. 
In the model transport and conversion characteristics of GFS were 
modelled as acetate, which is the most abundant granule forming sub-
strate in municipal wastewater treatment. GFS is derived from the fatty 
acids in the influent supplemented with the fatty acids formed by 
fermentation and hydrolysis of more complex influent COD (Layer et al., 
2019; Toja Ortega et al., 2021 ). The amount of GFS is in this context partly depending on the process conditions. Fermentation and hydro -
lysis were not included in the presented modelling framework, since for 
this sensitivity analysis the origin of the GFS is not important. The 
amount of GFS will determine if the wastewater is suitable for AGS. For 
future modelling and better design of AGS processes these fermentation 
and hydrolysis processes will need better characterization in order to 
include them in a reliable manner in aerobic granular sludge simulation 
platforms. 
3.7. Breakage 
Granules will eventually break into smaller pieces. In the model the 
chance of breaking is coupled to the granule size: larger granules have 
higher chance of breaking. The resulting pieces can become a seed for 
new granules. In the simulations the origin of granules (floc or breakage) 
was monitored. At the start, all granules originate from flocs. When large 
granules appear in the reactor, an increasing fraction of the biomass 
originates from broken-up granules. At the end of the simulation (after 
365 d) almost 20% originates from broken up large granules. This pro-
cess can be seen as a bypass of the lag phase. Some pieces will be larger 
than proto-granules and can develop into new granules without going 
through the stochastic growth process of the proto-granules. In this 
work, the probability of breakage was increased with increasing granule 
size based on a decreasing granule strength, as was reported by de 
Graaff et al. (2020) . The granule size beyond which a granule would 
have a definite probability to break-up was based on the maximum 
granule size observed in full scale Nereda ® (van Dijk et al., 2020 ). 
Granules can break-up in two parts of random volume, adding up to the 
volume of the original granule. In practice, breakage into multiple parts 
as well as attrition will occur (Beeftink and van den Heuvel, 1990 ). 
Reality is clearly more complicated than the implementation used for 
the sensitivity analysis in this study. However, all implementations 
would have the same qualitative effect as was observed in this study, 
determining the maximum granule size and generate nuclei of varying 
size for granulation to continue. For a part the breakage of large granules 
will be a driver for the acceleration of the granulation process in the 
granulation phase. Breakage of granules has a similar effect as adding an 
external seed of granules to a reactor (Pijuan et al., 2011 ). Both act as a 
source of new granules, bypassing the slow stochastic process of growing 
small granules out of flocs and proto-granules. So during start-up of AGS 
systems in practice a granular seed could speed up start-up times 
significantly. 
3.8. Model validity 
Various mathematical models have been developed to describe bio-
film growth (Wanner and Reichert, 1996 ) and biochemical conversions 
in (partially) aerobic reactors for wastewater treatment (Henze et al., 
1999 ). For the sensitivity analysis presented here, we opted to imple -
ment only conversions required to capture the basic dynamics a mech -
anism has on distribution of biomass over the size classes of granules. 
The model was intended for systems with an anaerobic feast phase and 
an aerobic famine phase. Only heterotrophic growth was assumed, with 
a constant VSS/TSS ratio, using two substrates (n-GFS and GFS) and an 
apparent yield for growth (modelling decay and growth combined). 
Consequently, the active biomass density was constant, homogeneous 
over the radius of a granule and independent of the historical substrate 
loading rate of a cluster. This history could also not impact the storage 
capacity of PHA. Regardless of these simplifications, the model was able 
to describe the principle behaviour of the granulation process, consisting E.J.H. van Dijk et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Water Research 216 (2022) 118365
10of a lag phase and a granulation phase, without focus on mimicking 
actual reactor performance. In the future the model could be extended to 
incorporate biological nutrient removal to investigate the effects of the 
mechanisms on reactor performance. 
3.9. Further analysis 
The sensitivity analysis performed in this study shows how delicate 
the start-up is of a AGS reactor from flocs. The lag phase that is seen in 
practice can be explained by the slow stochastic process of turning flocs 
into proto-granules and proto-granules into small granules. Selective 
wasting is an important mechanism for granulation, but in the lag phase, 
because of the entrapment of proto-granules in the sludge flocs, it has a 
limited effect. Granules are only selectively retained in the reactor, when 
they settle faster than the flocculent sludge fraction. So the selective 
wasting only starts to be effective when small granules appear in the 
reactor. The lag phase seems to be mainly driven by the presence of 
granule forming substrate and the ratio between proto-granule growth 
and production of new flocs. The latter is important for the retention 
time distribution of the proto-granules. Both flocs and proto-granules 
will have a different age. The distribution of age needs to allow for 
small granules to be formed, so the maximum retention time in distri -
bution determines if and how fast small granules are formed. 
In the granulation phase the other mechanisms become more 
important for the granulation process. Large granules will not be spilled 
through the selective wasting and will only disappear from the reactor 
through breakage. The largest granules receive the highest amount of 
substrate, because of the selective feeding. Their substrate uptake ca-
pacity combined with their abundance is large enough to take up all the 
substrate. As a consequence only a limited amount of granule forming 
substrate is available for the flocs and proto-granules in a mature 
granular bed. The large granules will filter out all substrate from the 
influent at the bottom of the reactor. It is a matter of “the winner takes it 
all”, as can be seen in Fig. 7, where we used a Lorenz curve to visualize 
this process. In economics the Lorenz curve (Lorenz, 1905 ) is used to 
visualize the inequality of the wealth distribution. We used it to visualize 
the inequality in the substrate sequestered by the granules. The 
accompanying Gini coefficients (Gini, 1912 ) are also shown. In the plot 
the cumulative amount of substrate taken up by the granules was plotted 
versus the cumulative amount of granules. The diagonal line would 
represents a completely even distribution of the substrate over all 
granules. The Lorenz curve at 3 different days is plotted. At the start of 
the simulation there is some inequality, but this is caused by the batch 
size that is smaller than the bed height. At the end of the lag phase there 
is already a large inequality with a Gini coefficient increasing from 
0.354 to 0.952, indicating a large change in substrate distribution. So at 
the end of the lag phase, already a large part of the substrate is 
sequestered by a small part of the granules. At the end of the granulation 
phase the inequality is even larger, with a Gini coefficient of 0.998, 
indicating that only a small fraction of granules sequester almost all the 
substrate, clearly showing the effect of the selective feeding. 3.10. Practical implications 
Growing granules from activated sludge flocs in a full-scale reactor 
can be a lengthy process, as shown in Fig. 1. The model shows that a lag 
phase is a natural part of the granulation process. In practice reactors are 
often seeded with AGS from other plants to shorten the lag phase. 
Seeding is a method to break out of the stochastic processes that 
dominate the length of the lag-phase. Besides providing insights on the 
granulation process, the model can help to optimize the start-up process 
and find an optimum between cost for seeding and length of the start-up 
process. The model can also be used to optimize the start-up strategy 
regarding selective wasting, applied batch size and cycle times. When in 
the future the model is extended with a more elaborate biological model, 
it can also be used to investigate the effect of granule size distribution on 
conversion rates and effluent quality. 
4.Conclusion 
A model was developed to provide a theoretical framework to 
analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge 
formation, which can form the basis for a comprehensive model that 
includes detailed nutrient removal aspects. The insights from this study 
can be used to further improve the granule formation in AGS reactors.

Mass transfer between bulk-liquid and biofilm 
The mass transfer coefficient was calculated based on Sherwood relations for forced convection around a free sphere (Cussler, 2009 ) (top relation) 
or semi-fluidized beds (Fan et al., 1960 ) (bottom relation). The choice depended on the local voidage of the sludge bed during feeding since no relation 
covered the complete voidage range (from settled granular bed (0.5) to nearly void of biomass):

Settling model 
The settling model for AGS developed van Dijk et al. (2020) was used to describe the settling of the individual groups of granules. In this model the 
settling velocity of different size classed of granules is described. Since this model only describes the settling behaviour of classes of granules, it was 
adapted to describe the settling behaviour of individual clusters of granules of the same size (j): 
vjkvfCjεeCjnj 2ρBCj ρbedCi
ρBCj ρLB (B.10) 
Furthermore, every cluster of granules (instead of classes) experienced an apparent voidage fraction of the surrounding liquid ϵe. The calculation of 
this apparent voidage fraction for individual granules is identical to the calculation for granule classes, only in this case is the diameter represents the 
individual granule instead of the granule class.

Similarly, the average granule diameter can be calculated based on groups of similarly sized granules at the same height in the reactor: 
davgCi⋃Ni

Although this approach works well for classes of granules, the model outcome is unrealistic when a large granule is surrounded by lots of small 
granules or flocs. davgCi will approach the size of the flocs in this case, leading to a very low value of εeCj for the large granule. The resulting low value of 
davgCi
dj makes the large granules stop settling all together. To cope with these rare cases, the value of εeCj is set to εL when εeCj εLD0B1. 
In the original model the ratio between the fluidizing velocity and the terminal velocity was found to be 0.5, after calibration with a single fraction E.J.H. van Dijk et al.

13between 1.0 and 2.0 mm. In this study we found that a value of 0.8 would give a better estimate for the smallest size fraction 100 and 200 µm, and still 
agree with the original data. A similar correction was made for the calculation of the expansion index. In the current model this was calculated based 
on the Archimedes number (Andalib et al., 2012 ):

Growth of granules within a cluster 
During each reaction phase, the volume (and thus the diameter) of a granule cluster was increased according to the amount of GFS accumulated as 
storage polymers during the anaerobic feeding phase, and a constant density and apparent yield throughout the granule. The new diameter of a 
granule cluster (j) was calculated using the following equation, assuming a spherical geometry:

Breakage of biofilm clusters 
The probability of breakage is calculated with a logistic function:

Aerobic reaction phase 
Processes taking place during the reaction phase were not modelled with time dependence, nor with a spatial dependence, but as a sequence of 
events. First, the residual GFS that was not stored anaerobically was distributed over all existing clusters based on specific biofilm surface area. Next, 
the diameter of all clusters was increased due to growth, based on an apparent yield (i.e. including loss from decay). All n-GFS fed during the anaerobic 
phase was subsequently converted into new flocs. The final step was breakage of particles. This is different from the time dependent approach often 
used in single biofilm modelling (Wanner and Reichert, 1996 ), but the simplification was justified due to the requirement of a discrete, cluster-based 
approach. Mixed wasting of sludge was applied for MLSS control at the end of the aeration phase. 
Appendix C.Model solution 
Model equations for the sludge movement were computed using an explicit forward Euler approach (anaerobic feeding phase and settling phase). 
Solute mass balances in the bulk-liquid and biofilm phases were discretized using finite differencing with an implicit Crank –Nicholson scheme (central 
difference in space, average in time). The source term representing biological conversion in the biofilm mass balance was discretized using an explicit 
forward Euler approach. The mass balances in both liquid and biofilm phases were solved (anaerobic feeding phase) fully coupled using LU- 
decomposition followed by forward- and back substitution as outlined by Koester et al. (1993) . Operations on the sludge cluster population were 
performed during the reaction phase the end of each phase. 
Appendix D.Calculation of Lorenz-curve and Gini-coefficient for substrate distribution 
A well-known method of analysing the inequality is the Gini coefficient (Gini, 1912 ). This Gini coefficient quantifies the inequality using the 
Lorenz-curve, which plots the cumulative fraction of the total income (y-axis) earned by a population fraction sorted (x-axis) (Lorenz, 1905 ). The Gini 
coefficient is determined by the ratio of the area between the equality line and the Lorenz curve, and the area between the Lorenz curve. To utilize the 
Gini coefficient for the quantitative analysis of the distribution of GFS in the feeding phase, the amount of GFS accumulated as storage polymers by 
each cluster was calculated weighted by the number of granules (G) represented by a simulated cluster (j). Before calculation, the clusters were sorted 
based on the amount of accumulated GFS from low to high. The y-axis of the Lorenz curve was defined as:
