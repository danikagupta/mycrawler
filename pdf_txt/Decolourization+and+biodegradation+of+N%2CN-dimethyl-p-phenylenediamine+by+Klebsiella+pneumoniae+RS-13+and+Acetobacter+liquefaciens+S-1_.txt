Abstract
In this present study, the effect of different environmental conditions for the bacterial decolourization of Reactive Orange –16
was investigated. Six different bacterial isolates were isolated and identified from the textile dye effluent. The isolated bacterial
isolates were identified and characterized as Bacillus odyssey ,Bacillus thuringiensis ,Bacillus subtilis ,Escherichia coli ,Proteus
mirabilisandStaphylococcus aureus . The effect of different environmental conditions for the decolourization of Reactive Orange
–16was studied. The dye decolourization was maximum at pH 7 and the optimum temperature for the decolourization was 40°C.
Among the various carbon and nitrogen sources tested, sucrose and peptone showed maximum decolourization percentage. The
decolourization of reactive azo dyes was assessed in different conditions viz., Static condition and Shaking condition. The
decolourization in sh aking condition was more effective when compared to the static conditions.
Keywords: Textile dye, Reactive Orange –16, Bacteria, Decolourization and Optimization.
Introduction
Dyes make the world more beautiful through coloured
substances, but on the other hand they represent a
serious pollution problem for the environment. Almost
one million tons of dyes are annually produced in the
world, of which azo dyes, characterized by an azo -
bond (R1–N=N –R2), represent about 70% by weight
(Haoetal., 2000). Azo dyes are the most common
synthetic colourants released to the environment via
textile, pharmaceutical and chemical industries
(Saranraj and Sivasakthivelan, 2013). The discharge of
azo dyes in water bodies is problematic not only for
aesthetic reasons, but also because azo dyes and their
cleavage products (aromatic amines) are carcinogenic
(Weisburger, 2002; Saranraj, 2013).
India's dye industry produces every type of dyes and
pigments. Production of dye stuff and pigments in
India is close to 80,000 tones. India is the second
largest exporter of dyestuffs and intermediates afterChina. The textile industry accounts for the largest
consumption of dyestuffs, at nearly 80%.
Industrialization is vital to a nation’s economy because
it serves as a vehicle for development. However, there
are associated problems resulting from the
introduction of industrial waste products into the
environment. Many of these products are problematic
because of persistence ( low biodegradability) and
toxicity (Saranraj et al., 2010; Sriram et al., 2013;
Saranrajet al., 2014).
Out of several methods that are used in the treatment
of textile effluents to achieve decolourization,
including physiochemical methods like filteratio n,
specific coagulation, use of activated carbon and
chemical flocculation some of the methods are
effective but quite expensive. Biotreatment offers a
cheaper and environmentally friendlier alternative for
colour removal in textile effluent. Bioremediatio n is a
pollution control technology that uses biological
Int.J.Adv.Res.Biol.Sci. 1(7):(2014):211–219
212systems to catalyze the degradation or transformation
of various toxic chemicals to less harmful form s. This
natural process, bioremediation, includes
bioengineering the capabilities of intrinsic
microorganisms, to clean up the environment is an
effective alternative to conventional remediation
methods (Vidali, 2009).
In the textile industry different st ructures of synthetic
dyes are often used during fiber processing, and
therefore the effluents produced are markedly variable
in chemical composition, including organics, nutrients,
sulphur compounds, salts and different toxic
substances In biological trea tment processes, various
physicochemical operational parameters, such as the
level of agitation, oxygen, temperature, pH, dye
structure, dye concentration, supplementation of
different carbon and nitrogen sources, electron donor
and redox mediator, directl y influence the bacterial
decolorization performance of azo dyes. Thus, to make
the process more efficient, faster and practically
applicable, prior determination of the effect of each
factor on the bacterial decolorization of azo dyes is
essential.
Materials and Methods
Collection of Textile dye effluent
The dye house effluent was collected from a dyeing
unit in Theco Silks, Thirubhuvanam region,
Kumbakonam district, Tamil Nadu, India. It was
refrigerated at 4 C and used without any preliminary
treatment.
Dyes used
TheReactive Orange -16 was used in this present
research. The dye samples were commercially graded
and supplied by the dealers of “SIGMA Aldrich,
USA”.
Isolation of bacterial isolates from Texti le dye
effluent
The bacterial isolates present in the textile dye effluent
were isolated by Serial dilution (Pour plate) technique.
In this method, 1 ml of sample was thoroughly mixed
with 99 ml of sterile distilled water, and then it was
serially diluted by following standard procedure upto
concentration of 10-6. Then, 1 ml of serially dilutedsamples from each concentration of samples were
transferred to sterile petriplates and evenly distributed
throughout the plates and sterile unsolidified Nutrient
agar was poured and it was allowed to solidify. The
Nutrient agar plates were incubated at 37 C for 24
hours. After incubation, the bacterial colonies were
isolated from the plates.
Maintenance of bacterial isolates
Well grown bacterial colonies were picked and further
purified by streaking. The isolated strains were
maintained on Nutrient agar slants and stored at 4 C.
Identification of bacteria isolated from Textile dye
effluent
Identification of the bacterial isolates was carried out
by the routine bacteriological methods i.e.,
a.By the colony morphology
b.Preliminary tests like Gram staining, Capsule
staining, Endospore staining, Motility,
Catalase and Oxidase.
c.Plating on se lective medias.
d.By performing biochemical tests.
Effect of different environmental conditions for the
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16
Effect of pH
Colonies of an overnight growth were suspended in
normal saline to obtain an optical density o f 0.6 at 610
nm wavelength. One milliliter of the cell suspension
was inoculated in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing
Nutrient broth and Reactive Orange -16 (500 mg/L).
The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
with hydrochloric acid and sod ium hydroxide. The
cultures were incubated at 30°C for 4 days in a rotary
shaker running at 180 rpm. Decolourization assay was
measured in the terms of percentage decolourization
using spectrophotometer. The percentage
decolourization was calculated from t he following
equation,

In the present study, six different bacterial isolates
were isolated and identified from the textile dye
effluent. The isolated bacterial isolates were identified
and characterized as Bacillus odyssey ,Bacillus
thuringiensis ,Bacillus subtilis ,Escherichia coli ,
Proteus mirabilis andStaphylococcus aureus . All the
bacterial isolates except Escherichia coli andProteus
mirabilis showed Gram positive reaction. The
characteristics of the b acterial strains isolated from
textile dye effluent were compared with MTCC
Reference strains. Khera et al. (2005) have reported
isolation of organisms adapted to high dye
concentration from sites near textile industries
complex. The selected isolate is a sporulating Gram
positive motile rod, occurring singly, grew as rough
colony on nutrient agar. On the basis of conventional
biochemical tests, it was identified as Bacillus cereus
orBacillusthuringiensis . Staining of the parasporal
body showed its presen ce, which indicated the identity
of the isolate as Bacillus thuringiensis (Saranraj and
Stella, 2012; Saranraj and Stella, 2014; Saranraj and
Sujitha, 2014; Jayanthi etal., 2014).
Saranraj et al. (2010) isolated five bacterial species
viz.,Bacillus subt ilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,
Escherichia coli ,Proteus mirabilis andKlebsiella
pneumoniae .Sadeeshkumar et al. (2011) isolated and
identified three different bacterial isolates viz.,
Bacillussubtilis, Escherichia coli andPseudomonas
aeruginosa from textile dye effluent. Giek Far Chan et
al.(2012) isolated and investigated the dye
decolourization ability of a novel bacterial consortium,
which consists of Citrobacter freundii ,Enterococcus
casseliflavus andEnterobacter cloacae .Sriramet al.
(2013) isolated three different bacterial isolates viz.,
Bacillus sp., Escherichia coli andPseudomonas
fluorescens from textile dye effluent contaminated soil
sample and used for the degradation study (Saranraj et
al., 2010; Saranraj and Stella, 2012; J ayanthiet al.,
2013; Saranraj and Sujitha, 3013). Recently, Saranraj
et al. (2014) isolated and identified six different
bacterial isolates viz.,Bacillus odyssey, Bacillus
thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus,
Alcaligenes sp., andNocardiops is albafrom the textile
dye effluent sample.
The decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was
investigated at different pH and the results were
furnished in Table –1.  Five different pH viz., pH –5,Int.J.Adv.Res.Biol.Sci. 1(7):(2014):211–219
214pH–6, pH –7, pH –8 and pH –9 were tested in th e
present decolourization study. Among the six bacterial
isolates tested, maximum decolourization of Reactive
orange-16 was observed in Bacillus odyssey at pH –
7 (70.66%) followed by Bacillus thuringiensis
(66.97%), Bacillus subtilis (64.20%) , Escherich ia coli
(60.93%) andProteus mirabilis (53.05%). The
bacterial isolate Staphylococcus aureus showed
minimum decolourization of Reactive Orange –16
(49.28%). Next to pH –7, maximum bacterial
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was observed
at pH –6, pH–5, pH –8 and pH –9.
Asadet al. (2007)found that pH between 6.0 and 8.0
was optimum for decolourization of triphenylmethane
and azo dyes by Bacillussp. Dafaleet al. (2008) found
that, the specific decolourization rate increased with
increasing pH from 5 to 7, which remained
approximately the same for pH 7 –8. This seems to
indicate that neutral and slightly basic pH values
would be more favorable for decolourizatio n process
of Remazole Black B by a bacterial consortium
containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In contrast to the
present results pH 7 was the optimum pH for the
decolourization of reactive red 195 by Enterobacter
sp. and the decolourization percentage decreas ed as
pH increased (Kalyani etal., 2008).
The effect of decolourization of Reactive Orange –16
at different temperature was investigated in the present
study and the results were furnished in Table –2.  Five
different temperatures viz., 20°C, 30°C, 40° C, 50°C
and 60°C were tested in the present decolourization
study. Among the six bacterial isolates tested,
maximum decolourization of Reactive orange -16 was
observed in Bacillus odyssey at 40°C (63.78%)
followed by Bacillus thuringiensis (57.66%) , Bacillus
subtilis(56.58%), Escherichia coli (51.71%), Proteus
mirabilis (43.75%) and Staphylococcus aureus
showed minimum decolourization of Reactive Orange
–16 (39.98%). Next to 40°C, maximum bacterial
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was observed
at30°C, 20°C, 50°C and 60°C.
The optimum temperature for decolourization was
found to be about 30 °C. It was observed that
Klebsiella pneumoniae andBacillus liquefaciens
showed no decolourization of Methyl Red at 45 °C
(Wong and Yuen, 1998). Klebsiella pneum oniaeand
Bacillus liquefaciens are mesophiles and the
temperature tested in the study (20, 25, 37, 45 and50°C) did not have significant effect on growth and
N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD)
degradation by these bacteria under varied
temperature.
Dafaleet al. (2008) found that, 37°C was the optimal
temperature for decolourization of remazol black -B
(RB-B) by a bacterial consortium containing
Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In contrast to the present
results, Hu et al. (1994) incubated Pseudomonas
luteolaat 28°C to obtain maximum decolourization
power of textile wastewater. Hefang et al. (2004)
investigated the effect of temperature on the
decolourization of azo dye Direct fast scarlet 4BS by
microbial consortium.
The increase in decolourization percentage after
addition of carbon sources is attributed to the fact that
the dyes are deficient in carbon content and
biodegradation without any extra carbon sources is
difficult (Padmavathy et al., 2003). The decrease in
decolourization percent after addition of some carbon
sources and the ability of some carbon sources to
induce growth without increase in decolourization
may attributed to that, the sugars may inhibit the
decolourization of azo dyes because its effect as
catabolite repression (Chang et al., 2001).
The effect of different carbon sources on
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was
investigated and the results were furnished in Table –
3.  Five different carbon sources viz., starch, glucose,
sucrose, lacto se and maltose were tested in the present
decolourization study. Among the six bacterial isolates
tested, maximum decolourization of Reactive orange -
16 was observed by Bacillus odyssey in the medium
supplemented with sucrose (79.81%) followed by
Bacillus thuringiensis (73.97%), Bacillus subtilis
(73.22%), Escherichia coli (63.34%) andProteus
mirabilis (61.61%). The bacterial isolate
Staphylococcus aureus showed minimum
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 (59.14%).
Next to sucrose, maximum bacterial d ecolourization of
Reactive Orange –16 was observed in the medium
supplemented with glucose, starch, lactose and
maltose.
Presence of starch as the best co -metabolite in
decolourization of azo dyes was supported by many
studies Padmavathy et al. (2003) found that starch was
the best carbon source in azo dye biodegradation fromInt.J.Adv.Res.Biol.Sci. 1(7):(2014):211–219

synthetic waste water under aerobic co -metabolite
conditions also Georgiou etal. (2005) suggested the
use of potato –starch industrial wastes to increase the
decolourization of textile waste water in large scale.
Also starch was added by Olukanni et al.(2006) in
studying the textile effluent biodegradation
potentialities of textile effluent -adapted and non -
adapted bacteria. In contrast to the present study,
glucose was used as a carbon source in
decolourization of reactive azo dyes.
Effects of some o ther carbon sources on bacterial
decolourization performance have been studied in
former researches. Lactate, peptone, succinate, yeast
extract, and formate were proved to enhance
decolourization, while sucrose, and dextrin resulted in
lower decolourizatio n activities (Xu et al., 2006). A
screening test for the ability of this isolates to utilize
azo dyes as a sole carbon source was established to
select the most potent organisms and exclude that
decolourization may occur due to adsorption only.
This techni que was used by Asad et al. (2007) where
the ability of halophilic and halotolerant bacterial
isolates to utilize Remazole black -B as sole carbon
source was used to select the most effective isolates.
Ayedetal. (2010) used glucose in decolourization of
Remazol Black B by halotolerant and halophilic
isolates.
The effect of different nitrogen sources on
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was assessedand the results were furnished in Table –4.  Five
different nitrogen sources viz., yeast extract,
ammonium chloride, peptone and ammonium sulphate
were tested in the present decolourization study.
Among the six bacterial isolates tested, maximum
decolourization of Reactive orange -16 was observed
byBacillus odyssey in the medium supplemented with
peptone (75.68%) followed by Bacillus thuringiensis
(73.00 %) , Bacillus subtilis (68.33%), Escherichia coli
(62.50%), Proteus mirabilis (59.27 %) and
Staphylococcus aureus (54.05 %) showed minimum
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16. Next to
peptone, maxim um bacterial decolourization of
Reactive Orange –16 was observed in the medium
supplemented with ammonium chloride, yeast extract
and ammonium sulphate.
Nigamet al. (1996) reported that bacterial consortium
PDW did not show decolourization when yeast extract
was omitted from the medium. Growth of
Pseudomonas luteola was directly related to the
concentration of yeast extract and when the
concentration of yeast extract was reduced growth and
colour removal dec reased (Hu, 1998). Different
concentrations of yeast extract along with glucose
were tested and it was found that medium containing
0.05% yeast extract showed maximum decolourization
(94%) whereas a further increase in concentration of
yeast extract showed a decrease in decolourization.
Nigamet al. (1996) have also reported maximum
decolourization of azo dyes in presence ofyeastInt.J.Adv.Res.Biol.Sci. 1(7):(2014):211–219
218extract (5 g/L) in PDW consortium. Peptone, as a
nitrogen source, othe r than yeast extract was used in
the medium with BHM and glucose and it exhibited
good decolourizing (90%) ability. The color removal
percentage of most dyes increased sharply after
addition of yeast extract and this is in accordance with
other reports (As adet al., 2007).
The decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 by
bacterial isolates and bacterial consortium under static
and shaking condition was investigated and the results
were furnished in Table –5.  Among the six bacterial
isolates tested, maximum decolourization of Reactive
orange-16 was observed by Bacillus odyssey
(72.92%) under shaking condition followed by
Bacillus thuringiensis (68.81%), Bacillus subtilis
(66.21%), Escherichia coli (63.03%) andProteus
mirabilis (55.40%). The bacterial isol ate
Staphylococcus aureus showed minimum
decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 (51.38%).
The decolourization of Reactive Orange –16 was
maximum in shaking condition when compared to the
static condition. Various groups have reported that
bacterial degra dation is best under aerobic and shaking
conditions (Chen et al., 2003). In order to test is this
was also true for our isolates, a study was done under
static and shaking conditions. The degradation of the
dye also appeared to be dependent on the shaking
culture of the culture.
