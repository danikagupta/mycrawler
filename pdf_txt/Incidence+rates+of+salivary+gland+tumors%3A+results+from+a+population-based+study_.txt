Abstract: (1) Background: Epidemiological studies of epithelial salivary gland neoplasms are difﬁcult
to conduct effectively due to tumor rarity, histological heterogeneity, tumor location diversity, and a
lack of national registries collecting data. This study presents 26 years of epidemiological data from
a single institution in southern Poland that estimates incidence rates of primary epithelial salivary
gland tumors. (2) Methods: The charts of 805 patients with epithelial salivary gland tumors were
retrospectively reviewed. (3) Results: Pleomorphic adenomas occurred less frequently in elderly
patients; however, Warthin tumors were more common ( p< 0.001). Pediatric patients mainly suffered
from mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The estimated crude and European age-standardized incidence
rates of all primary epithelial salivary gland tumors were 6.7 and 6.02 per 100,000 population,
respectively. The incidence rates of salivary gland tumors increased in recent years; however, this
is attributed to an increase in benign tumors ( p< 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The incidence of primary
epithelial salivary gland tumors in southern Poland has increased over the past 26 years. This increase
is attributed to a rise in the number of patients with benign tumors, particularly Warthin tumors in
elderly patients. Moreover, the incidence of malignant salivary gland tumors appears to be higher in
pediatric patients.

1. Introduction
Salivary gland tumors are rare neoplasms that comprise approximately 3–6% of all
head and neck tumors. The incidence rate varies from 0.4 to 13.5 cases per 100,000 popu-
lation, with most salivary gland tumors being benign [ 1]. Generally, most salivary gland
tumors occur in the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular and minor salivary
glands. However, in some cases, salivary gland tumors are also observed to originate from
the upper aerodigestive tract, such as the lacrimal gland or cervical lymph nodes [ 2,3].
The current 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) salivary gland tumor classiﬁcation
guidelines distinguish 31 different primary neoplasms [ 4]. The most common histological
types are pleomorphic adenoma (PA), Warthin’s tumor (WT), mucoepidermoid carcinoma
(MEC), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) [ 5–7]. However, large histological heterogene-
ity with a wide range of tumor locations may cause diagnostic and therapeutic problems in
some cases.
While several large series of salivary gland tumors have been published in the En-
glish literature, only a few are from European institutions [ 2,5–11]. The majority of the
epidemiological studies available assess the incidence rate of malignant salivary gland
neoplasms [ 12,13]. Moreover, data from the Polish National Cancer Registry are limited to

malignant major salivary gland tumors (ICD-10: C07 malignant neoplasm of the parotid
gland and C08 malignant neoplasm of other and unspeciﬁed major salivary glands), thus
only representing a collection of epithelial tumors as well as nonepithelial, secondary, and
hematolymphoid malignant neoplasms. Available data from malignant minor salivary
gland tumors are limited. Some papers do estimate an incidence rate of benign salivary
gland tumors [ 14,15]. However, those studies also include nonepithelial tumors and are
limited only to parotid neoplasms. This is the ﬁrst report in the English literature on a
large series of primary epithelial salivary gland tumors in Poland. This paper presents
epidemiological data from a single institution over the last 26 years and estimates the
incidence rates of malignant and benign tumors in southern Poland.
2. Materials and Methods
Prior to data collection and analysis, Institutional Review Board approval was obtained
(No: 122.6120.287.2016). Because the study was conﬁned to a chart review and retrospective
in nature, the Institutional Review Board waived the need for patient consent so long as all
personal information remained conﬁdential.
A retrospective chart review of all patients treated for salivary gland tumors at our
Department between January 1994 and December 2019 was conducted. Patients meeting
any of the following exclusion criteria were excluded from the study: tumor-like lesions
(chronic inﬂammations, cysts, sclerosing polycystic adenosis, benign lymphoepithelial
lesions, IgG4-related disease, Sjögren syndrome, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, oncocytic meta-
plasia, toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease, Masson’s tumor, mononucleosis), secondary
tumors (malignant melanoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma, follicular thyroid cancer, clear
cell renal cell carcinoma, undifferentiated lung carcinoma), nonepithelial tumors (lipoma,
hemangioma, Schwannoma), and lymphomas. The remaining patients with primary ep-
ithelial salivary gland neoplasms were included in the study group. Study group patient
charts were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated based on demographic characteristics
and histopathological aspects.
According to the Polish National Cancer Registry (PNCR) database, 556 cases with
the ICD-10 codes C07 and C08 were diagnosed between 2009 and 2017 in the province
of Małopolska in southern Poland. The crude incidence rate (CR) was 0.89 per 100,000
population and the European age-standardized incidence rate (EASR) was 0.8 based on
the European Standard Population (ESP-2013). The PNCR incidence rates for Małopolska
were scaled by the ratio of C07 and C08 neoplasms to all neoplasms (malignant and benign,
minor and major salivary gland), based on the data collected by the authors to estimate
incidence rates for different groups of patients. The Poisson distribution was used to
compare the incidence rates from different time periods in the study.
The study cohort was divided into groups based on sex (female or male), age (0–19,
20–59, and over 60 years old), and time period (1994–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2019) to
estimate any differences between them. Comparison of the qualitative variables for each
patient group was performed using the 2test (with the Yates’s correction applied for
22 tables) or the Fisher’s exact test for small values. The Mann–Whitney Utest was
conducted to compare quantitative variables among two groups, while the Kruskal–Wallis
test was conducted for three or more groups. If statistically signiﬁcant differences were
detected after the Kruskal–Wallis test was completed, post-hoc analysis using the Dunn’s
test was performed to further identify the statistically signiﬁcant groups. A signiﬁcance
level of 0.05 was used for all tests ( = 0.05). All statistical analyses were performed using
R v4.0.2 (R Core Team (2020); R: A language and environment for statistical computing.
R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
3. Results
A total of 940 patients were identiﬁed as having received treatment for salivary gland
tumors within the study date range. Of these 940 patients, 72 patients were excluded for
tumor-like lesions, 30 patients were excluded for secondary tumors, 20 patients were ex-J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1663 3 of 12
cluded for nonepithelial tumors, and 13 patients were excluded for lymphomas. Therefore,
the resulting study group totaled 805 cases of primary epithelial salivary gland neoplasms.
All patients in the study population were of Caucasian ethnicity.
3.1. Histological Type and Distribution
During the 26-year period reviewed, 805 patients underwent surgical treatment for
primary epithelial salivary gland tumors. Among these patients, 566 (70.3%) had benign
tumors and 239 (29.7%) had malignant tumors. The ratio of benign to malignant neoplasm
was 2.37:1. PA was the most common tumor and comprised 66.4% (376/566) of all benign
tumors and 46.7% (376/805) of all salivary neoplasms. The second most common was WT,
accounting for 24% (136/566) of all benign tumors and 16.9% (136/805) of all tumors in
the study group. Of the 239 malignancies, ACC (73/239, 30.5%) was the most common
histological type, followed by MEC (58/239, 24.3%). The details of histological type and
sites of tumors are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

In elderly patients, PA occurred less frequently, but WT was more common ( p< 0.001).
The percentage of PAs decreased with each patient age group, whereas the percentage
of WTs increased. Pediatric patients primarily suffered from MEC, and the percentage
of those tumors decreased with age group. In contrast, the incidence of ACC increased
with each age group ( p= 0.002). The results also indicated a higher incidence of malignant
neoplasms among the youngest patients ( p= 0.051).
3.3. Sex
Of the 805 patients, 441 (54.8%) were female, and 364 (45.2%) were male. The female-
to-male ratio was 1.2:1. A comparison of patient characteristics between female and male
patients is presented in Table 4.

In the study group, males were older than females ( p= 0.047), WT was observed more
often in males, and PA was observed more often in females ( p< 0.001). ACC accounted
for a larger percentage of malignant tumors in females than males; however, males often
suffered from types of carcinomas other than ACC and MEC ( p= 0.028).
3.4. Time Period
This cohort was divided into three time periods: 1994–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2019.
Changes of clinicopathological factors in each time period are presented in Table 5.

With each subsequent time period, the age of operative patients increased ( p< 0.001).
Likewise, the number of parotid gland tumors increased over the years ( p< 0.001). In the
most recent time period, a higher incidence of benign neoplasms was observed ( p= 0.003).
This is mainly attributed to an increase in the number of patients operated on for WT
(p< 0.001). The proportion of PA among benign tumors was the highest in the 1994–2000
period and decreased over time ( p= 0.004). The highest number of ACC cases among
malignant neoplasms was observed between 2001 and 2010, while the number of patients
treated for MEC increased over the last ten years ( p= 0.05).
3.5. Incidence
The estimated Małopolska province incidence rates, CR and EASR, were 6.7 and 6.02
per 100,000, respectively (Table 6). For benign tumors, the CR was 4.71, and the EASR was
4.23. The CR and EASR for malignant tumors were 1.99 and 1.79, respectively. Primary
epithelial salivary gland tumors in children and adolescents were very rare with a CR and
EASR of only 0.49 for both. The CR and EASR increased with the age of patients and were
the highest in elderly patients at 19.33 and 18.8, respectively. The CR and EASR for benign
and malignant tumors were similar between males and females. The incidence rates of
salivary gland tumors increased in recent years; however, this was due to an increase in
the number of benign tumors ( p< 0.001). The incidence of malignant neoplasms remained
at the same level over all three time periods ( p= 0.867) (Table 7).

4. Discussion
Epidemiological studies of epithelial salivary gland neoplasms are difﬁcult to conduct
effectively due to tumor rarity, histological heterogeneity, tumor location diversity, and
a lack of national registries collecting data, especially for benign tumors. Since 2014, the
Polish National Major Salivary Gland Benign Tumors Registry has been collecting data on
benign major salivary gland tumors in Poland [ 16]. However, the registry also contains
data on nonepithelial tumors and does not include the incidence of benign minor salivary
gland neoplasms, which amounted to 82 cases constituting 14.5% of benign and 10.2%
of all epithelial neoplasms. The majority of available epidemiological studies are single-
institution reviews from around the world. Although some papers include nonepithelial
neoplasms, many studies only present a descriptive epidemiology of salivary gland tumors
without a statistical assessment [2,6–11,15].
In the vast majority of cases, epithelial salivary gland tumors are benign, which
accounted for 70.3% of neoplasms in our study. This is comparable to results from other
centers in the world, where benign neoplasms comprised a range from 57.7% to 77.7% of
cases [ 2,5,7,8,10,11,17]. Only Tilakaratne et al. observed a higher percentage of malignant
tumors (50.1%) in the Sri Lankan population [ 9]. In all present epidemiological studies,
PA is the most common salivary gland tumor [ 2,5,7–11,17]. Likewise, PAs accounted
for 66.4% of benign and 46.7% of all neoplasms in our analysis. In 75.3% (283/376) of
cases, PAs were located in the parotid gland, followed by 14.6% (55/376) in the palate.
PAs were the only histologically benign neoplasms observed in our group of pediatric
patients. The percentage of PAs in the benign salivary gland tumors group decreased with
each subsequently older patient age group ( p< 0.001). There was also a signiﬁcantly more
frequent occurrence of PA among women ( p< 0.001), which is similar to other studies [ 5,6,9].
The number of patients receiving surgical intervention due to PA has increased in recent
years. However, the percentage of PAs relative to other benign neoplasms has decreased
compared to the end of the 20th century ( p= 0.004).
In accordance with the literature, WT was the second most common primary epithelial
salivary gland tumor in our study [ 2,5,6,10,17]. In our results, WT constituted 24% of all
benign tumors (136/566) and 16.9% of tumors in the entire study group (136/805). WT
was more common in patients over the age of 60, especially among men ( p< 0.001). This
was in line with other studies [ 2,5,6,8,11]. Recently, we observed an increase in the number
of patients receiving surgical intervention due to WT when compared to other benign
salivary gland tumors ( p< 0.001). This increase in the incidence of WT may not only
be the result of smoking; this increase may also be correlated to obesity, an increasinglyJ. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1663 9 of 12
major problem in modern society. In the Małopolska province, 16% of the adult population
suffers from obesity [ 18]. The incidence of obesity increases with population age, the same
as the risk for WT. This can be corroborated by Kadletz et al., where they observed a
statistically higher BMI in patients with WT when compared to patients treated for other
benign salivary gland tumors [ 19]. Additionally, higher incidence of WT can be explained
by higher sensitivity in their detection in imaging examinations. WT is known to have
high 18-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and therefore might be found in the parotid
gland as an incidentaloma in PET/CT [ 20]. Schwalje et al. proved that the growth rate
of WT is slow, especially in patients over 75 years old [ 21]. For this reason, conservative
management (wait and see policy) of WT, diagnosed with ﬁne-needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC), is an alternative to surgery, especially for patients suffering from cancers treated
with nonsurgical modality. In the current study, in the vast majority of cases, WT was
located in the parotid gland. In ﬁve cases, WT was found in the cervical lymph nodes; in
four of these patients, the tumors were synchronous with oral squamous cell carcinoma,
suggesting neck metastases. Extraparotid localization is uncommon and only observed in
up to 8% of all WTs [ 3]. In other epidemiological studies, the authors did not describe WT
in the cervical lymph nodes but did present single cases of WT in the submandibular and
minor salivary glands [ 2,5,7–9]. However, none of the epidemiological studies found WT
in the sublingual gland. Our group did not observe WT in the remaining major and minor
salivary glands.
According to the WHO and most epidemiological studies, the most common malig-
nant salivary gland tumor is MEC [ 1,5–9,11,13,22]. However, in some studies, particularly
from European centers and our study results, the most common malignant tumor was
ACC [ 2,10,12,17,23]. In our study, ACC accounted for 30.5% (73/239) of malignancies and
9% (73/805) of all tumors. ACC was mainly located in the minor salivary glands (73.6%,
53/73), most often in the maxilla and palate (73.6%; 39/53). There were no cases of ACC in
the pediatric and adolescent group. Only single cases of ACC in pediatric patients have
been described in the literature [ 9,24,25]. However, we did observe that the incidence of
ACC increased with each subsequent patient age group ( p= 0.002), and peaked in the
adult patient group (20–59 yo). This neoplasm was also observed more often in females
(p= 0.028), the same as in other studies [ 12,19,23]. The highest percentage of patients with
ACC was observed from 2001–2010. Presently, the number of patients treated for ACC has
decreased ( p= 0.05). Additionally, Sentani et al. observed a slight decrease in the number
of patients with ACC in the last two decades [ 26]. This is likely due to the current more
accurate histological differential diagnosis.
The second most common malignant tumor was MEC, constituting 24.3% (58/239) of
malignant neoplasms and 7.2% (58/805) of all neoplasms. Similar to ACCs, 70.7% (41/58)
of MECs were usually located in the minor salivary glands, most often in the maxilla and
palate (56.1%; 23/41). MECs were the most common malignant neoplasm in the pediatric
and adolescent group, and their incidence decreased with each older patient age group
(p= 0.002). Fortunately, the majority of MECs in pediatric patients are low-grade with
favorable outcomes [ 24,25,27]. Nevertheless, an increase in the incidence of MEC had been
observed ( p= 0.05) in recent years (2011–2019).
The majority of primary epithelial salivary gland tumors are located in the major salivary
glands, most frequently in the parotid gland [ 2,5–8,10,17]. Likewise, in our study, tumors
of the major salivary glands occurred in 586 (72.8%) cases, 81.7% (479/586) of which were
parotid tumors. An increase in the number of patients recently operated on for major salivary
gland neoplasms was observed in this study ( p< 0.001). Certain anatomical locations are
predisposed to benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasms occurring [ 11,28]. Most
parotid gland tumors are benign, ranging from 68.7% to 88% of tumors [ 2,5–10]. This is
concurrent with our results, where 77.6% (455/586) of tumors were benign. Benign neoplasms
are reportedly more common in the submandibular gland [ 2,5–8,10]. However, in both our
analysis and in Tilakaratne et al., an almost equal percentage of malignant and benign tumors
was found in the submandibular gland [ 9]. Tumors of the sublingual gland are very rare,J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1663 10 of 12
accounting for only about 1% of all salivary gland tumors [ 2,6,7,9,10]. In contrast to the parotid
and submandibular glands, the percentage of malignant sublingual gland tumors is much
higher, ranging from 75% to 100% in the literature [ 2,5–7,9,10]. In our study , neoplasms of the
sublingual gland accounted for approximately 0.9% (7/805) of cases, of which 71.4% (5/7)
were malignant. In accordance with the literature, the most common malignant neoplasm in
the sublingual gland was an ACC [ 2,5–7,9]. On the other hand, the only histologically benign
tumor in the sublingual gland was a PA, the same as in other studies [2,6,7,9].
Minor salivary gland tumors accounted for a relatively high percentage of cases 26.6%
(214/805) in our study. In various studies in the literature, the incidence of minor salivary
gland tumors ranges from 14% to 28% of cases [2,5,6,8,10,26]. In our analysis, most minor
salivary gland neoplasms were malignant (61.7%, 132/214). Our results correspond to
studies from other clinical centers [2,5,10]. A lower percentage of malignant neoplasms is
observed in studies from pathology centers [ 7,9]. This is likely due to the fact that many
benign minor salivary gland tumors are treated in dental surgery outpatient clinics, and
therefore their epidemiology is underestimated [ 28]. In palatal and buccal mucosa tumors,
a similar percentage of benign and malignant neoplasms were observed. The malignancy
of minor salivary gland tumors increased for lower locations within the oral cavity. In this
cohort, 100% of tumors located in the lower lip, tongue, ﬂoor of the mouth, or gingiva were
malignant. Likewise, 88.9% (8/9) of tumors in the retromolar triangle were also malignant.
Similar observations were found in other studies [11,29].
Recently, the CR and EASR of salivary gland tumors have increased; however, this
can be largely attributed to the increase in the number of patients treated for benign
tumors. Over the past 26 years in the Małopolska province, the number of patients treated
for malignant salivary gland tumors increased; however, the CR and EASR remained
stable ( p= 0.867). This was probably caused by population growth and aging. The
incidence of malignant salivary gland tumors also remained stable in other countries,
such as the USA, the Netherlands, Denmark, China, and Japan [ 12,13,19,23,26]. There
are a few studies in the literature assessing the incidence rate of benign salivary gland
neoplasms, but only in the major glands [ 14,15,30]. In the Pinkston and Cole study, the
age-standardized incidence rate for benign major salivary gland tumors was 4.72, which
corresponds to the results of our study, where the EASR for all benign salivary gland tumors
was 4.23 [ 30]. Epidemiological studies of primary epithelial salivary gland neoplasms
exhibit a large degree of bias, which is often due to the fact that nonepithelial, secondary,
and hematolymphoid tumors are not excluded from the analysis. On the other hand,
single-center studies are not of sufﬁcient statistical power to estimate the number of new
cases in the present population. In addition, studies originating from oncological centers
will be biased by a greater percentage of patients being treated for malignant tumors.
Moreover, data from the National Cancer Registers only concern malignant tumors and
often only include data on secondary neoplasms [ 22]. Primary benign minor salivary gland
tumor incidence is often underestimated by the frequent treatment of these tumors in small
outpatient dental surgery centers. The most accurate epidemiological data would likely
be obtained from the national registries that are collecting data from pathology centers
because they consider whether the tumor is primary, secondary, or recurrent.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study found an increase in the incidence of primary epithelial
salivary gland tumors in southern Poland. This increase was mainly attributed to the
increase in the number of new cases of benign tumors, especially WT in elderly patients.
Moreover, the incidence of malignant salivary gland tumors appears to be higher in
pediatric patients than in adult and elderly patients. ACC was the most common malignant
tumor, although the incidence of MEC has increased recently.J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 1663 11 of 12
